Rex McBride, LA private detective and self-proclaimed heel, needs to forget. He needs to forget his last case. And he needs the money that Mr. Vickers offers him &hellip; ten percent of the dough that disappeared with Nordstrom after he looted the Southern Counties Buildings & Loan.

Nordstrom himself got away clean with something over $2 million in his pants at the time. Now, after three years, Mrs. Sibyl Nordstrom has booked passage on the Honolulu Queen to Honolulu; she may be off to meet her husband.

But when murder, mysterious spies and intrigue on the Pacific Ocean and Honolulu ensue, can McBride unravel the mystery before more people are killed?

Find out in this breath-taking mystery set against a pre-World War II scenario of international intrigue, greed, revenge and murder.

Find out why AND SUDDEN DEATH is still a favorite read of murder mystery fans 75 years after it was first serialized as HOMICIDE HONOLULU BOUND in 1939.
