### Henry Is Dead
{: .chaptertitle }

When he came into Wellington Police Headquarters it was ten minutes past nine P. M. It was a warm May night and at the high desk they were booking a ragged, emaciated drunk with a dirty, sweating face and a reek of sour wine coming from him.

Paris walked by the desk to the worn wooden stairway. There was an airless odor of dust and disinfectant, of stale cigar smoke. He went up the stairs. The wood was rotted and the boards creaked under his tread. On the second floor the corridor was littered with cigarette butts, scraps of paper, gum wrappings. In comparison, he thought of an Army barracks, or even the State Police Barracks at Bridgewater with its spit and polish and its inspections. But it’s not the fault of the Wellington cops, he thought. They don’t live in like soldiers and state troopers do. There’s no pride in housekeeping, and there’s always a steady traffic of sordid flotsam and jetsam, and the custodial help is always political.

There was a door of frosted glass and on it were the words: DETECTIVE BUREAU. Paris opened it. Near the door a thick-browed, heavy-faced detective was seated at a small oak desk, typing a report with two fingers. He was in wrinkled shirtsleeves and his shoulder holster was strapped tightly under his armpit. The typing stopped. The detective said, “You can go right in, Inspector—” He flicked his head to the closed door at the rear of the room. “Captain Madera’s expecting you.”

“Thanks,” Paris said. He crossed the room. Along the wall there was a wooden bench, its arms worn, the finish rubbed off long ago by nervous, fearful, seating hands. 

A woman sat on the bench. She was small and sixtyish, lumpish and almost shapeless, with a toil-worn, wrinkled face and string gray hair. She wore an old blue coat that had been mended near one buttonhole. Underneath it was a skirt of a neat, starched housedress. Her low shoes were polished, but the leather was shabby, and the shoelaces broken and tied in knots. Her hands were in her lap and she was twisting them, the knuckles red, rough and arthritic. Her eyes came up to Paris, staring at him with watery, pathetic hopelessness.

“You come to see me?” she asked timidly.
