### Chapter 1
{: .chapternumber }

It was a trooper named Keith Ludwell who was first on the murder scene. He had been on patrol a mile south of the town when he received the radio call rushing him in his cruiser to the Fedder house at 12 Montague Street, Dorset. He arrived there two minutes after the murderer drove away in his blue truck.

Just minutes previously, the neighbors on Montague Street had seen pretty, twenty-one-year-old Mary Ann Fedder driving her little Nash at great speed to her house. Behind her was the blue panel truck. Mary Fedder had left her car, raced into her house and slammed the door shut.

Moments later the sergeant at the State Police barracks in Topsfield had received Mary Ann's urgent, hysterical call that somebody was trying to kill her. While she was on the telephone talking to the sergeant, the murderer had broken the door down and had fired four shots at her. The man ran out and drove away. The gathering neighbors had seen the murderer, the truck and the license plate. But because the man was armed with a pistol nobody had dared make a move to stop him.

When Trooper Ludwell arrived the frantic people were out on the sidewalk in front of the house, pointing in the direction where the truck had disappeared, shouting the license number and yelling about the shots that had been fired.

I know Keith Ludwell would have liked nothing better than to chase the murderer. He couldn't, of course. His first job was to render all possible aid to the victim. So Ludwell, being a meticulous trooper, ignored the neighbors and ran into the house to Mary Ann Fedder. He saw her bullet-torn face, the wide-open staring eyes and knew she was dead and there was no help to be given. He had immediately phoned Sergeant Bart Neal at the barracks. Neal told him to stay there with the body.

It was 2:04 on Tuesday afternoon in the fourth week of May and, at the time, I was on a routine patrol six miles west of Dorset near Dorset Pond. At 2:01, on my shortwave radio, I had heard the Signal 16 to Ludwel. But because the message wasn't for me I hadn't paid much attention to it.

The story continues &hellip; buy it today and find out <br> who tried to kill Mary Ann Fedder, and why!
