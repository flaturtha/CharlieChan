excerpt: "Sex was Junie's trademark, the wiggle, the tight black dress, the sultry voice. George Pringle, president of Micro Records, set it up that way. \n\n
\"We'll begin with a very high-heeled, backless shoe,\" Pringle said, walking around Junie, examining her from every angle, feeling her breasts and thighs and hips, while June held her breath to keep back the tears. \n\n
\"No girdle, so when you walk they'll notice every movement. And when you sing you're going to sound like you're crying for every man who's listening. I want men to pant when they hear you sing!\" \n\n
But Pringle is dead, shot with Junie's pearl-handled .32 S & W revolver after a heated argument at her Briercliff home. Now it is up to Wade Paris, Chief of Detectives of the Massachusetts State Police, to determine if Junie is a cold-blooded killer or innocent patsy. \n\n
Is she the seemingly sweet young singer caught up in the ruthless record business or the swinging sexpot determined to make it big? \n\n
**The Blonde In Black** ... the explosive, low-down, inside story of murder, sex, violence and ruthless greed in the big-time record business.
