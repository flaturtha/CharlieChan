<p>The murder didn’t take place until after 7 p.m. on the night of December 2nd. At twenty minutes past four on the afternoon of that day, Eve Flavell reached the house that had once been her home on Henderson Square. She looked at her watch as she went around the corner. It had turned cold in mid-morning and fog had come sweeping in from the sea. The Square was full of it. The tops of the trees in the private park about which the Square was built stood up out of the fog faintly golden or black-branched against grayness; the leaves still clung tenaciously to the oaks and beeches. Lighted windows had begun to surround the Square on all four: sides like colored lanterns hemming in a lovely wood.</p>

<p>Most of the children in the park had gone home. Those that were still there behind the high iron fence and the concealing shrubbery weren’t making any noise. A sparrow chattered and a taxi honked. The wind was bleak. Eve Flavell shivered and flattened her shoulders under the raspberry tweed of her coat. Almost there now, she thought. How long was it since the last time—two months, three? She couldn’t remember.</p>

<p>She paused opposite the house she had come to visit, the house in which she had lived for a good many years. It was her half-sister Natalie’s. The family had come here from the country when Nat was five, so that she could go to Miss Grant’s kindergarten on Henderson Place, where her mother, long since dead, had gone as a child. It was a beautiful house, of warm red brick with blue shutters and a white fan-light door. It had a groomed, cared-for, a washed and brushed and combed look, was prosperous, graceful, benign. It stood on the west side of the Square between two less ornamental neighbors and the anonymous and soaring bulk of an apartment hotel.</p>

<p>Eve stared at the brass knocker glimmering through the dusk. In a moment she would cross the street, mount the steps and use the knocker. It would rap with a brisk thud, the door would open and that would be the end—of one part of her existence, at least, a part for which she had fought hard and that she hated to relinquish. She put out a narrow arched foot in a red calf sandal, drew it back and remained on the curb, asking herself for the twentieth time in the space of an hour whether it wouldn’t have been just as well to phone. The news would be the same over the wire as if she delivered it in person. She told herself angrily that she was being a fool. What difference did it make how the thing was done as long” as it was finally accomplished? Sooner or later she would have to meet them all face to face, and there were generally people to tea and it would be easier in a crowd. Or would it? The matter was taken suddenly out of her hands.</p>

<p class="tobecontinued">The story continues … buy it today and find out <br /> what news Eve has and how it connects to a murder later that evening.</p>
