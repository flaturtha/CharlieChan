					<description>&lt;p&gt;The boys down at Homicide have a special interpretation of what the middle initial in the name of Captain Howard T. Pearsons really means. They like that tall lanky ex-football player with his penetrating mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;The 'T' means 'Thorough',&quot; says Detective Peter Reilly. &quot;When my boss gets on a case his mind looks for every point and never overlooks the smallest detail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For in solving crime you face a paradox. The thing that is often very obvious is exactly what is overlooked by everyone &amp;mdash; from the cop to the killer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
