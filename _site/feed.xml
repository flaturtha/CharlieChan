					<description>&amp;quot;Denial is useless,&amp;#39;&amp;#39; said Carroll at last. &amp;quot;I was taken in the act.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His manner was indefinably strange. If one may attempt description, it was more like an invalid&amp;#39;s than a criminal&amp;#39;s. This man of cultured mind and delicately sensitive nature seemed to feel neither remorse nor shame. There was evidence of considerable anxiety, but this state was repeatedly interrupted by involuntary outbursts of reassurance, almost of satisfaction.</description>
