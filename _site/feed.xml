&lt;p class=&quot;firstpara&quot;&gt;Ah, the mystery. Does any other form of the story captivate the reader quite like a whodunit, with the intrepid detective facing off with a dastardly killer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably the most popular form of fiction, it can be seen across the myriad of entertainment today, ranging from shelves of books at your local bookstore or online book retailer to the lists of television programs and movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is the mystery story and where did the modern form come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;definition-of-the-mystery-story-form&quot;&gt;Definition of the Mystery Story Form&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply defined, the mystery story is a genre of fiction that sets up a puzzle and challenges the reader to unearth the clues to solve the crime or other upset in the status quo. It proposes a question, such as: Who committed the crime? How was it done? What was done and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is up to the reader to follow along with the hero of the story, often a detective—whether someone who claims the title as part of a job or just an interested amateur— to find the clues that will answer the question posed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most readers, when they think of a mystery story, think of the murder mystery story popularized by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Edgar Allen Poe, Agatha Christie, and Dashiell Hammett, among others. These stories center around the crime of murder and the quest to bring justice by unmasking the killer. The classic whodunit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the mystery story can also be written from the perspective of the crook; some mystery stories pit ‘good-guy’ crooks against ‘bad-guy’ cops. The caper subgenre typically follows the crooks as they plan and execute their crime, usually stealing some valuable diamond or art work. These fall under the heading of the inverted mystery, or the howdunit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mystery stories sometimes present a supposedly supernatural terror like a haunted house that may or may not have a hidden but natural cause; think of the classic Scooby Doo mysteries where a scary monster keeps the good citizens away from a house, part of town, etc., but is really just some crook who’s trying to counterfeit cash or run folks off so he can capitalize on a hidden oil reserve. Answers the questions of what and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subgenres within the mystery story main genre include: the cozy, locked room, police procedural, amateur or professional sleuth, inverted or howdunit, historical, Golden Age, legal, paranormal, hardboiled, noir, Holmesian, woman/child in peril, caper/heist, espionage/spy…the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while many purists might not include capers or crook-centered stories, yarns about things that go bump in the night, or spy thrillers as mysteries, because they revolve around the themes of crime, theft, or violent death and carry with them a sense of suspense with a puzzle—will the daring thief outwit the bumbling cops; will the kids discover the truth behind  the swamp monster mask; will the daring spy escape the evil regime to return with the dangerous information?—they fit the broad definition of the mystery form—a story with a puzzle that challenges the detective, and the reader, to answer the question: whodunit, howdunit, or whydunit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;did-edgar-allen-poe-create-the-modern-detective-story&quot;&gt;Did Edgar Allen Poe create the modern detective story?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image__inpostL&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img id=&quot;Poe&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/murderwiki/Poe.png&quot; alt=&quot;Edgar Allen Poe&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Edgar Allen Poe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most experts, or at least most websites, claim that the modern mystery story originated with Edgar Allen Poe. He is called the “Father of the Detective Story”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worlds-best-detective-crime-and-murder-mystery-books.com/1841.html&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.MysteryNet.com&quot;&gt;MysteryNet.com&lt;/a&gt;, a leading site “for online mysteries and mystery games” that also discusses the history and origins of the literary form says that the general mystery story form “… as we know [it] today did not emerge until the mid-nineteenth century when Edgar Allen Poe introduced mystery fiction’s first fictional detective, Auguste C. Dupin, in his 1841 story, ‘The Murders in the Rue Morgue.’”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mysterynet.com/timeline/history-of-mystery/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a deeper look at the works of Poe and the mystery form of fiction shows that while Poe took the form to a new level and may have introduced readers to the concept of a detective, stories revolving around crime and its aftermath have existed almost since time began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-first-murder-mystery--the-deep-historical-origins-of-mystery-stories&quot;&gt;The First Murder Mystery &amp;amp; the Deep Historical Origins of Mystery Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; “Then the Lord said to Cain, ‘Where is Abel, your brother?’ And he said, ‘I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?’ &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; He said, ‘What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying to Me from the ground.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%204:9-10&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;Genesis 4:9‑10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken from the Bible’s first book, originating from the very beginnings of creation itself, this story tells of Cain murdering his brother Abel out of jealousy and God, cast as a sort of detective, seeking out the killer. Generally accepted to have been written by Moses during the Israelite wandering in the wilderness (1450 – 1410 B.C.E.), this short vignette could easily be the first murder mystery put in written form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image__inpostR&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img id=&quot;Poe&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/murderwiki/Hercules_killing_Cacus_at_his_Cave.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hercules killing Cacus at his cave&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Hercules killing Cacus at his cave&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the plays of Ancient Greece, like those of Sophocles and Euripides, included elements of mystery and certainly murder in their dramas. Roman mythology also included elements of the mystery story. Indeed, Hercules fought Cacus&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacus&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, a fire-breathing giant and son of Vulcan, who stole eight of Hercules’ cattle by walking them backwards into a cave, perhaps the first instance of a crook using subterfuge to try to outwit the detective in pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other examples of ancient mysteries include “Oedipus the King” by Sophocles (430 B.C.E.), a story of patricide; “The Three Apples” from the &lt;i&gt;One Thousand and One Arabian Nights&lt;/i&gt; (800-1300), about a dismembered body found in a heavy locked chest and the vizier’s task of solving the murder in three days; and the Gong’an, or crime-case fiction of the Chinese Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) involving government magistrates who solve criminal cases.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelockedroommystery.com/origins-of-mystery-fiction&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image__inpostR&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img id=&quot;Poe&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/murderwiki/gutenberg.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gutenberg's press&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Johannes Gutenberg's screw-type press&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A direct result of the Renaissance and Johannes Gutenberg’s (1398 – 1468) creation of the moveable type press, the general populace of England and Europe began to learn to read. With this new found skill came the desire to read more than just the Bible and other official texts. The insatiable human thirst for drama and intrigue drew people to written accounts of executions and murder trials as recorded by local magistrates and shire sheriffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, &lt;i&gt;The Newgate Calendar&lt;/i&gt;, subtitled &lt;i&gt;The Malefactor’s Bloody Register&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Newgate_Calendar&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, a monthly bulletin of executions produced by the Keeper of the Newgate Prison in London, was a popular form of story for the general reader. Highly sensational and often embellished, these stories were biographies of notorious criminals and took a high-handed approach to preaching against crimes like murder, theft, and prostitution. They began as compilations of broadsheets and fed on the public fascination with crimes, trials and punishment. The original issue was published in 1773&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/21cc/crime/media1/calendar1/facts1/facts.html&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subsequent development of professional police forces, the Bow Street Runners in London (1749) and the Sûreté in France (1812) spawned a number of supposedly carefully collected recollections of actual cases. The Memoirs of a Bow Street Runner by Henry Goddard is a prime example. Their complete genuineness and accuracy are debated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas De Quincy published a seminal work called “On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts” in “Blackwood’s Magazine” in 1827. It is a fictional account of a speech to a gentleman’s club on the aesthetics of murder. It had a significant influence on future mystery and crime authors and was even cited by G. K. Chesterton. It is also the inspiration for &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidmorrell.net/&quot;&gt;David Morrell&lt;/a&gt;’s (father of “Rambo”) 2014 novel &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Murder-Fine-Thomas-Emily-Quincey/dp/031621678X&quot;&gt;Murder as a Fine Art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, which puts De Quincy in the role of murder suspect in a series of ferocious mass murders in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-first-serialized-mystery-stories--the-advent-of-the-mystery-magazine&quot;&gt;The First Serialized Mystery Stories &amp;amp; the Advent of the Mystery Magazine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the demand for more stories increased from the poor and middle class readers, publishers began to print what became known as the penny dreadfuls, or penny bloods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image__inpostR&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img id=&quot;Poe&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/murderwiki/Dickens_by_Watkins_1858.png&quot; alt=&quot;Charles Dickens&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Charles Dickens&lt;br /&gt;by Watkins, 1858&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cheaply produced periodicals included serialized novels and short stories ranging from Pierce Egan the Elder’s &lt;i&gt;Life in London&lt;/i&gt; (1821 – 1824)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.priceonepenny.info/notes.php&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to Charles Dicken’s many works including &lt;i&gt;The Pickwick Papers&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Oliver Twist&lt;/i&gt;. Typically sold for a shilling, these works were lavishly illustrated and came out as monthly serials&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.priceonepenny.info/notes.php&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheap serialized stories appeared in the late 1820s and were sold in weekly editions for a penny each. Subject matter ranged from Gothic thrillers about vampires and ghouls to sensationalized exploits of detectives and criminals. Innovations during the Victorian Era in Britain such as improvements to mass printing, the increased capacity for travel, and an increasingly literate public created a mass market for cheap, popular literature and were priced to be affordable to the working-class&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_dreadful&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image__inpostL&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A typical yellowback novel.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second half of the nineteenth century, a new form of cheap novel gained a foothold. Called a yellowback for its distinct yellow cast covers, created using a technique called chromoxylography, which is a color woodblock printing process, these books were designed to compete with the penny dreadfuls, these book length works were often sordid and sensational, sold cheaply to satisfy the working-class tastes for torrid entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be outdone by the Brits, the American mystery writers produced their own versions of the yellowback novels, soon called dime novels, story papers, and thick books. These were the early versions of what later became the popular pulp mystery magazines. Like their British cousins, the dime novels were written quickly, with sensationalist plots and lurid detail. The earliest dime novels were not mysteries, per se, but dealt with general life of the time, such as western adventures featuring real-life characters like Wild Bill Hickok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image__inpostR&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img id=&quot;Poe&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/murderwiki/oldsearch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Old Search&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Old Cap Collier Library&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular mystery characters included “Old Sleuth”, “Nick Carter” and a publication called “The New York Detective Library”, created by Frank Tousey. “The New York Detective Library”, like “The Old Cap Collier Library”, featured a single character that carried through numerous adventures and written by numerous authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally running 32 pages with a black-and-white illustration on the cover, these dime novels and related early pulp magazines evolved quickly, adding pages (up to 200 pages per issue) and Tousey introduced color covers in 1896 as a way to compete with the numerous other publishers vying for the public’s eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the late nineteenth century, however, new high-speed printing techniques enabled Frank Munsey, who created the juvenile magazine “The Argosy”, to grow his title into an adult fiction magazine that became the first pulp magazine&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dime_novel&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-first-works-of-the-modern-mystery-story-form&quot;&gt;The First Works of the Modern Mystery Story Form&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cited by crime fiction historians as the predecessor of the classic crime novel, &lt;i&gt;The Adventures of Caleb Williams&lt;/i&gt; (1749) by William Godwin tells the story of Williams who suspects his master has murdered a neighbor and framed a tenant by planting evidence. Godwin is credited with doing the detective legwork himself to develop the plot, starting with the desired conclusion and working backwards to the beginning in order to spin a well formed mystery story. It is a technique still common in mystery writing&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bookstellyouwhy.com/a-brief-history-of-the-mystery-novel&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E. T. A. Hoffman published a novella in 1819 called &lt;i&gt;Mademoiselle de Scudéri, A Tale from the Times of Louis XIV [Das Fräulein von Scuderi.Erzählung aus dem Zeitalter Ludwig des Vierzehnten]&lt;/i&gt;. The novella gained immediate critical and commercial success and is heralded for its exciting, suspenseful plot. Set in Paris, France during the reign of King Louis XIV, it tells of a city under siege by a band of thieves who murder citizens with a deliberate dagger thrust to the heart to steal jewels intended for illicit lovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mademoiselle de Scudéri, an elderly poet soon finds herself in the midst of the crime investigation when a succession of events puts her face to face with the supposed killer. Although she herself does not solve the crime, her involvement with the young man accused makes this a fine example of a murder mystery story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe, himself, is said to have been influenced by Hoffman’s thriller, as well as by Voltaire’s &lt;i&gt;Zadig&lt;/i&gt; (1747), also a novel of crime, murder, and betrayal, when he wrote “The Murders in the Rue Morge” (1841), which introduces the first recognized detective, C. Auguste Dupin. Dupin is the archetype of the literary detective, displaying the characteristics we have come to expect, including a considerable intellect, creative imagination, and the ability to put himself into the mind of the killer. All traits made more famous by perhaps the single-most famous literary detective of them all, Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after Poe’s creation of Dupin, Wilke Collins(1824 – 1889) published what is alternatively regarded as the first true detective novel, &lt;i&gt;The Woman in White&lt;/i&gt; (1860). The novel was so popular that “…every possible commodity was labeled ‘Woman in White’”, including cloaks and bonnets, perfume, and even music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is based on an eighteenth century case of abduction and wrongful imprisonment. The hero, Walter Hartright, was the first to use techniques later popularized by private detective stories. Collins went on to write more than 30 novels, classified today as “sensation novels”, which are seen as the precursor to detective and suspense fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;William Gillette as Sherlock Holmes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1887, Irish-Scots physician Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle (1859 – 1930) published the first in a series of short stories in “The Strand” magazine called “A Study in Scarlet”, featuring the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes. Eventually appearing in four novels, 56 short stories, and countless films and television series—even called by the Guinness World Records “the most portrayed movie character” in history—Holmes perhaps exemplifies best the image of a literary detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first woman to write detective and mystery fiction, American Anna Katherine Green, published &lt;i&gt;The Leavenworth Case&lt;/i&gt; in 1878, and sold a quarter of a million copies. It earned her the title of “The Mother of the Detective Novel” because of the skilled detective work of uncovering hidden fact, often historical, that led to the resolution of the crime. Her techniques are still in use today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green’s success spawned a number of other successful and significant female mystery authors including Mary Roberts Rinehart (known as the American Agatha Christie, although she preceeded the famous British author by 14 years) and Dorothy Cameron Disney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image__inpostL&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mary Roberts Rinehart:&lt;br /&gt;creator of the phrase,&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The butler did it!&quot;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rinehart’s style is said to have a lot in common with the later hardboiled school of detective fiction, and is part of the American school of scientific detection. She is credited with the phrase, “The butler did it.”, which appeared in her novel &lt;i&gt;The Door&lt;/i&gt; (1930) and invented the “Had-I-But-Known” school of mystery writing with &lt;i&gt;The Circular Staircase&lt;/i&gt; (1908). She, herself, was influential on other mystery writers including Helen Reilly and Theodora Du Bois.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only publishing nine novels, Dorothy Cameron Disney is nonetheless seen as one of Rinehart’s most gifted followers. &lt;i&gt;Death in the Back Seat&lt;/i&gt; (1939) and &lt;i&gt;The Strawstack Murders&lt;/i&gt; (1938-39) were classically plotted mystery novels. Other works were more social commentary and puzzle plot stories. Her mystery stories bring her closest to the major Golden Age period and style of mystery fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-locked-room--the-beginnings-of-the-golden-age&quot;&gt;The Locked Room &amp;amp; the Beginnings of the Golden Age&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the mid-teens, a new form of the mystery gained popularity, the so-called “locked room” mysteries. An early puzzle-style mystery, the locked room presented the detective with a seemingly impossible situation, where the victim is murdered without any way for the killer to enter or exit the room. It is simply locked from inside. The reader is presented with all of the clues and is challenged to figure out how the murderer was able to kill and then vanish into thin air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the mid-teens, the earliest examples of what became known as the Golden Age of mystery and detective fiction began to appear. These mysteries were part of the flourishing British detective novel movement and set the standard for the British mystery. They grew out of the puzzle stories like the locked room and were seen as pure entertainment, as games where the reader matched wits with the author. The murders themselves usually took place off stage and the stories centered around the bucolic settings of English villages and small towns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Golden Age stories is called the “apex of the [mystery] genre, embodying all of the important elements that make the form so appealing.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~stb27/gadficintro.htm&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is the genre of mystery and detective fiction that introduced the concept of ‘fair play’ on the part of the author, although it was not uncommon for authors to hold back a vital clue that the detective would reveal on the last page. In the late 1920s, Monsignor Ronald A. Knox (1888 – 1957) wrote “The Ten Rules of Detective Fiction”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Knox said that a detective story, “must have as its main interest the unravelling of a mystery; a mystery whose elements are clearly presented to the reader at an early stage in the proceedings, and whose nature is such as to arouse curiosity, a curiosity which is gratified at the end.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_detective_fiction&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Golden Age of mystery and detective fiction ran from the earliest examples in about 1913 through the beginning of World War II. Some of the best known British mystery writers today were of this style, including Agatha Christie (1890 – 1976), Dorothy L. Sayers (1893 – 1957), Margery Allingham (1904 – 1966) and Philip MacDonald (1900 – 1980). Not to be outdone, American writers also tackled this popular form and significant contributors include John Dickson Carr (1906 - 1977), Ellery Queen (pseudonym of cousins Frederik Dannay (1905 - 1982) and Manfred Bennington Lee (1905 – 1971)), and S. S. Van Dine (1888 – 1939).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the British authors were creating gentile murders, the American authors of the 1920s began to write in a more “realistic” style. When Black Mask magazine was launched in April 1920&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackmaskmagazine.com/history.html&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by literary journalist H. L. Mencken and drama critic George Jean Nathan, it launched a new style of mystery short story and took off where the yellowbacks and dime magazines of the nineteenth century left off. Although best known for its mystery short stories, “Black Mask” was presented “the best stories available of adventure, the best mystery and detective stories, the best romances, the best love stories, and the best stories of the occult.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image__inpostL&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img id=&quot;Poe&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/murderwiki/BM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Black Mask magazine&quot; width=&quot;325&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Black Mask magazine, Sept. 1920&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first pulp detective magazine ushered in the era of the hardboiled detective, an anti-hero type who was often hard drinking, hard womanizing, and often at odds with the law himself. Dashiell Hammett, known for &lt;i&gt;The Maltese Falcon&lt;/i&gt; (1930); Raymond Chandler, author of &lt;i&gt;The Big Sleep&lt;/i&gt; (1939); Erle Stanley Gardner, creator of Perry Mason, and other pulp masters got their start writing for “Black Mask”. Other significant writers of the hardboiled style include George Harmon Coxe (1901 – 1984), W. R. Burnett (1899 – 1982), and Ellery Queen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to the cozy style of the Golden Age mysteries in England, this American style of writing emphasized the raw edge of life. Violence was frequent and vivid. Sex played a key role, as did alcohol. The detectives were neck deep in the corruption of their day, from the mistrust of the police and authorities to the organized crime that grew out of the 1930s prohibition movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardboiled style grew in popularity as the public trust in the police and their ability to uphold the law or even follow it themselves diminished during the excesses of the Roaring ‘20’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar genre, one often confused with hardboiled, that rose during this era is the noir story. Taken from the French word for ‘black’, the term referenced the dark, harsh realities of life. But unlike a hardboiled mystery that centered around a private eye or other crime solver, the noir story focused on the average man or woman caught up in some dark situation. Often framed for murder, running for his life, the noir protagonist must evade the cops, the bad guys trying to kill or frame him and find the clues that will prove his innocence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or not. A major convention of the noir plot was that the innocent do not always win. Justice does not always prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;from &lt;i&gt;Deuces Dealt for Death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant contributors to the noir style include Hammett, as well as James M. Cain’s &lt;i&gt;The Postman Always Rings Twice&lt;/i&gt; (1934) and Horace McCoy’s &lt;i&gt;They Shoot Horses, Don’t They&lt;/i&gt; (1935)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://noirfiction.info/what2.htm&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both hardboiled and noir styles of mystery fiction dominated the American scene through the 1930s and into the beginnings of World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;post-wwii-patriotism--the-rise-of-competent-cops&quot;&gt;Post WWII Patriotism &amp;amp; the Rise of Competent Cops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World War II saw a shift in the attitude of the American people towards authority figures and a similar shift in what the public wanted in their mystery fiction. As patriotism, in both America and Britain, grew out of the effects of the war, a new form of detective fiction took shape. Instead of featuring a loner private eye, it featured the intelligent, crafty and honest police detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the police detectives portrayed in mystery fiction up until this point in history were either comic relief or mere window dressing for the crafty private detective. Ranging from Conan Doyle’s Inspector Lestrade who frequently sought Sherlock Holmes’ help in anything but the simplest cases to the corrupt officials often portrayed in the pulp stories, police detectives were shown little respect by mystery writers, reflecting the public’s opinion of the authorities as less than helpful at best, corrupt and incompetent at worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image__inpostR&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img id=&quot;Poe&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/murderwiki/EvanHunter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ed McBain, aka Evan Hunter&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Ed McBain, pseudonym of&lt;br /&gt;author Evan Hunter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rise in patriotism came a new found respect for government forces and authority, and along with it, the desire in the public and by the writers themselves to show the police detectives in a better light. Many of the stories centered around single police detectives like Inspector Morse of Colin Dextor’s (b. 1930) imagination to Ed McBain’s (1926 – 2005) Detective Steve Carella, featured in the &lt;i&gt;87th Precinct&lt;/i&gt; stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to stories centered on a single police detective, the police procedural story found root, featuring more than just detectives. The police procedural depicts the full cadre of police teams, from detectives to forensics teams. Popularized in much of the television programs starting in the 1950s and continuing to today, the police procedural turns the classic whodunit plot on its head by revealing the murderer right away; in fact, often showing the murder as it is being committed. The thrill for the reader is the chase by the police to apprehend and bring the criminal to justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;television-movies--the-continued-mystery-of-the-mystery&quot;&gt;Television, Movies &amp;amp; the Continued Mystery of the Mystery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As television and film grew in popularity and more households had access to easy entertainment just a click of a button away, the mass popularity of magazines like “Black Mask” and “Detective Fiction Weekly”, among others began to die off. So, too, did the mass market paperback novel. They didn’t die completely, as demonstrated by the continued publication of “Ellery Queen” magazine and a few others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of the World Wide Web, a few publications attempted to revitalize the pulp magazine style but few managed to find strong enough audiences to make a real go of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the love of the mystery still lives on, as strong as ever. According to book publishing statistics, mystery fiction constitutes between 25–28 percent of all fiction sold in the United States each year. The styles and subgenres haven’t changed and current authors regularly move between Golden Age and cozy styles to modern takes on the noir or hardboiled PI story. And even a casual look at any television listing shows many, if not most of the shows airing are some kind of mystery story, proof that the form is far from dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the earliest gossip between tribesmen on some prehistoric plain about a murder committed out of jealousy or greed through the various incarnations of detectives, both amateur and professional, from bumbling accidental discovery of clues to organized investigation of every facet of a mystery, the fascination with murder, crime, the dark side of life has never been far from the human psyche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the desire to tell a lurid story, of demonstrating our greater intellect over that of an author or literary detective or our friends, has brought people together for uncounted centuries. It may be gruesome, but it’s great entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">From the earliest versions of the mystery story through the modern age, the mystery story has evolved from simple riddles to complex plots involving a myriad of detective types, plot devices and styles. What was once merely a puzzle, has evolved into a full-blown literary style and remains one of the most popular forms of fiction.</summary>

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is the detective story? To entertain, to interest, to amuse. It has no deeper intent, no more subtle raison d'etre than to give pleasure to its readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been argued that its &quot;awful examples&quot; (sometimes very awful!), are meant as cautionary pictures to restrain a possible bent toward the commission of crime. It is held by some that the habit of analytical and synthetical reasoning, requisite to appreciate the solving of these fictional mysteries, is of value in training the mind to logical and correct modes of thinking; the practical application of which, in the everyday affairs of life, proves a valuable asset in the worldly struggle for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Mr. H. E. Dudeney, in the &quot;The Canterbury Puzzles&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There is really a practical utility in puzzle-solving. Regular exercise is supposed to be as necessary for the brain as for the body, and in both cases it is not so much what we do as the doing of it, from which we derive benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Albert Smith, in one of his amusing novels, describes a woman who was convinced that she suffered from 'cob-wigs on the brain.1 This may be a very rare complaint, but in a more metaphorical sense, many of us are very apt to suffer from mental cobwebs, and there is nothing equal to the solving of puzzles and problems for sweeping them away. They keep the brain alert, stimulate the imagination and develop the reasoning faculties. And not only are they useful in this indirect way, but they often directly help us by teaching us some little tricks and 'wrinkles' that can be applied in the affairs of life at the most unexpected times, and in the most unexpected ways.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting passage in praise of puzzles, in the quaint letters of Fitzosborne. Here is an extract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The ingenious study of making and solving puzzles is a science undoubtedly of most necessary acquirement, and deserves to make a part in the meditation of both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an art, indeed, that I would recommend to the encouragement of both the Universities, as it affords the easiest and shortest method of conveying some of the most useful principles of logic. It was the maxim of a very wise prince that 'he who knows not how to dissemble knows not how to reign;' and I desire you to receive it as mine, that 'he who knows not how to riddle knows not how to live.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But though all this may be true as a vague result, it is not the author's real purpose. He writes solely for entertainment; presumably the entertainment of his audience, but often equally for the entertainment of himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;inquisition-into-the-curious-is-universal&quot;&gt;Inquisition into the Curious is Universal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detective story, and now we include the whole range of mystery or riddle stories, is founded on a fundamental human trait, inquisitiveness. Man is an incarnate interrogation point. The infant's eyes ask questions before his tongue can do so, and soon the inquiring eyes are supplemented by a little outstretched hand, trying to satisfy a curiosity by the sense of touch. But, once having achieved a vocabulary, however small, he uses it almost entirely to make inquiries, until so prominent becomes this trait, that his conversation is cut off altogether, and he is condemned to be visible but not audible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attaining further intelligence, his inquiries become more definite and thoughtful, though no less numerous and eager. He seeks books, whether in or out of running brooks; he inquires of authorities, or he reasons out answers for himself, as he grows in body and brain. He meets a friend in the street, he pours out questions. In his business he progresses by one question after another. Is he an inventor? He questions of Nature till he probes her various secrets. Is he a philosopher? He questions his soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Mr. Dudeney again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The curious propensity for propounding puzzles is not peculiar to any race or to any period of history. It is simply innate in every intelligent man, woman, and child who has ever lived, though it is always showing itself in different forms; whether the individual be a Sphinx of Egypt, a Samson of Hebrew lore, an Indian fakir, a Chinese philosopher, a mahatma of Tibet, or a European mathematician makes little difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Theologian, scientist, and artisan are perpetually engaged in attempting to solve puzzles, while every game, sport, and pastime is built up of problems of greater or less difficulty. The spontaneous question asked by the child of his parent, by one cyclist of another while taking a brief rest on a stile, by a cricketer during the luncheon hour, or by a yachtsman lazily scanning the horizon, is frequently a problem of considerable difficulty. In short, we are all propounding puzzles to one another every day of our lives—without always knowing it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An orator makes his best effects by questions. The Book of Job is impressive largely because it is written in interrogative form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many trite quotations are questions. &quot;What is truth?&quot; or &quot;Is life worth living?&quot; arrest our attention because they are debatable queries. Who is not more interested in the Questions of the Day than in the known facts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Mr. George Manville Fenn, the man who invented a wondrous and mysterious plot for a story deserves a palm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;He must have been a deep thinker, one well versed in the philosophy of goose quill, knowing that his story would thrill the reader, and that he had achieved the great point of seizing upon that reader's imagination, and holding it, so that he would follow the mystery of the fiction to the very end. It may have been the result of some haphazard lucky thought, but still he must have been a careful student of every-day life, and must have duly noted how largely curiosity or the desire to fathom the unknown is developed in the human brain.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with other human traits, inquiry is inherent to a greater extent and also more largely developed in some minds than in others. Some people say &quot;How do you do?&quot; and wait interestedly for your answer. Others say &quot;How are you?&quot; and without pausing for reply, go on to remark about the weather. But it is the people who are interested in answers who care for detective stories. It is the people who care for the solution of a problem who write and read mystery tales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One who has studied these questions from many points of view, and, above all, noted how a story will &quot;catch on,&quot; and almost electrically seize the imagination of the reading world, will constantly see that in the majority of cases the most popular fiction of the day is that in which mystery plays a prominent part—a mystery which is well concealed. This is no secret. It is the natural desire for the weird and wonderful—that hunger for the knowledge of the unknown which began with the forbidden apple; and the practiser of the art in question merely grows for those who hunger, a fruit that is goodly to the eye, agreeable to the taste, and one that should, if he—or she—be worthy of the honored name of author, contain in its seeds only a sufficiency of hydrocyanic poison to make it piquant in savor. It is no forbidden fruit that he should offer, merely an apple that is hard to pick—a fruit whose first bite excites fresh desire, whose taste brings forth an intense longing for more, and of which the choicest and most enticing morsel is cleverly held back to the very end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Dudeney observes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is extraordinary what fascination a good puzzle has for a great many people. We know the thing to be of trivial importance, yet we are impelled to master it, and when we have succeeded there is a pleasure and a sense of satisfaction that are a quite sufficient reward for our trouble, even when there is no prize to be won. What is this mysterious charm that many find irresistible? Why do we like to be puzzled? The curious thing is that directly the enigma is solved the interest generally vanishes. We have done it, and that is enough. But why did we ever attempt to do it? The answer is simply that it gave us pleasure to seek the solution—that the pleasure was all in the seeking and finding for their own sakes. A good puzzle, like virtue, is its own reward. Man loves to be confronted by a mystery—and he is not entirely happy until he has solved it. We never like to feel our mental inferiority to those around us. The spirit of rivalry is innate in man; it stimulates the smallest child, in play or education, to keep level with his fellows, and in later life it turns men into great discoverers, inventors, orators, heroes, artists and (if they have more material aims) perhaps millionaires.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the kernel of their interest is resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mystery and its solution designedly set forth in narration, implies a previous sequence unknown to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this re-solution that attracts the alert brain, and stimulates the reader to solve for himself a problem whose answer he will shortly learn. But he wants to learn that answer as corroborative proof of his own solution, and not as a revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this instinct great in some, small or perhaps even entirely lacking in others, that makes a mind interested in puzzles or mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;early-riddles&quot;&gt;Early Riddles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enjoyment of puzzles or mysteries is as old as humanity itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First there is the ancient Riddle, that draws upon the imagination and play of fancy. Readers will remember the riddle of the Sphinx, the monster of B?otia, who propounded enigmas to the inhabitants and devoured them if they failed to solve them. It was said that the Sphinx would destroy herself if this one of her riddles were ever correctly answered: &quot;What animal walks on four legs in the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening?&quot; It was explained by Oedipus, who pointed out that man walked on his hands and feet in the morning of life, at the noon of life he walked erect, and in the evening of his days he supported his infirmities with a stick. When the Sphinx heard this explanation, she dashed her head against a rock and immediately expired. Puzzle solvers may be really useful on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the riddle propounded by Samson. It is perhaps the first prize competition in this line on record, the prize being thirty sheets and thirty changes of garments for a correct solution. The riddle was this: &quot;Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.&quot; The answer was, &quot;A honeycomb in the body of a dead lion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic &quot;Riddle of the Sphinx&quot; is mythological rather than historical, and belongs to the Grecian deity, not the Egyptian Sphinx. Its date is unauthenticated, but at least it wears the halo of antiquity, for Sophocles wrote of it in the Fourth Century B.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samson has been called the Father of Riddles, but merely because his famous riddle was among the first to creep into print. Doubtless older and better ones were buried in an oblivion from which they can never be disinterred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Out of the eater,&quot; propounded 1200 B.C., does not strike us as an exquisitely clever conceit, but it embodies the true principle of the riddle and of the riddle story. The asker already knew the solution, and that was why the guessers strove to attain a re-solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days riddles were proposed at wedding feasts and other social gatherings, a practice still obtaining to a degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Queen of Sheba came to visit Solomon, &quot;to prove him with hard questions.&quot; And Solomon, in his turn was addicted to the giving of riddles to Hiram, King of Tyre, who was fined for those he failed to guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the Egyptians, puzzling was a religious rite and the Sphinx was their goddess. We are told that such was the esoteric religion of the Egyptians that all the priests were riddlers and their religion one vast enigma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other recorded ancient riddles are of interest to the antiquarian, but enough has been said here to prove the inherent love of Question and Answer in man's mind from the earliest ages. From earlier than Samson to later than Sam Lloyd the puzzle has held its own among mental activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And puzzle, in its broader sense includes all branches of mystery or detective stories as well as mere riddles or conundrums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Century Dictionary defines puzzle as &quot;A riddle, toy or contrivance which is designed to try one's ingenuity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-passion-for-solving-mysteries&quot;&gt;The Passion for Solving Mysteries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the crux of the mystery story. It is designed to try the reader's ingenuity at re-solution. The exercise of this tried ingenuity is what gives the entertainment or amusement found in a mystery story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of mentality or the kind of mental bias that gives pleasure in puzzling is the same in author and reader. The talent that knits is the same talent that unravels. The propounder uses the same kind of acumen as the guesser, and his pleasure in doing so is of the same sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to say just what this mental faculty is, but we who possess it know that its exercise gives us exquisite enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the athlete rejoices in his muscular prowess, as the musician rejoices in the melodies he makes, as the artist glories in his painted masterpiece, yea, even as the clam is notoriously happy in his own element, so the mental acrobat revels in concentrating all his brain power on an analytical problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowell declared that Poe had two of the prime qualities of genius—&quot;a faculty of vigorous yet minute analysis and a wonderful fecundity of imagination.&quot; These two qualities are present to a greater or less degree in every lover of mystery fiction; and it is the degree that determines the intensity of the call of the author and the response of the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-literature-of-mystery&quot;&gt;THE LITERATURE OF MYSTERY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes for worthwhileness in mystery fiction of any kind is the puzzle and its answer—not the gruesomeness of a setting or the personality of a hero or the delineation of a character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A liking for mystery fiction is not a mark of poor taste or an indication of inferior intellect. Its readers form an audience greatly misunderstood by other literary people whose mentality lacks this bent. But what especial audience is not misunderstood? Do not many people say to music lovers, &quot;I don't see how you can sit through Parsifal&quot;? Do not some scoff at people who trail through art galleries, catalogue in hand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us concede that a taste for mystery fiction is not universal. We will even admit that in its nicer points the riddle story may be &quot;caviar to the general,&quot; but we will not agree that it is unworthy a place in literature or that it is outside the pale of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-rightful-place-of-the-mystery-story-in-fiction&quot;&gt;The Rightful Place of the Mystery Story in Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Harry Thurston Peck says in &quot;Studies In Several Literatures&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Supercilious persons who profess to have a high regard for the dignity of 'literature' are loath to admit that detective stories belong to the category of serious writing. They will make an exception in the case of certain tales by Edgar Allan Poe, but in general they would cast narratives of this sort down from the upper ranges of fine fiction. They do this because, in the first place, they think that the detective story makes a vulgar appeal through its exploitation of crime. In the second place, and with some reason, they despise detective stories because most of them are poor, cheap things. Just at present there is a great popular demand for them; and in response to this demand a flood of crude, ill-written, sensational tales comes pouring from the presses of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But a detective story composed by a man of talent, not to say of genius, is quite as worthy of admiration as any other form of novel. In truth, its interest does not really lie in the crime which gives the writer a sort of starting point. In many of these stories the crime has occurred before the tale begins; and frequently it happens, as it were, off the stage, in accordance with the traditional precept of Horace.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The real interest of a fine detective story is very largely an intellectual interest. Here we see the conflict of one acutely analytical mind with some other mind which is scarcely less acute and analytical. It is a battle of wits, a mental duel, involving close logic, a certain amount of applied psychology, and also a high degree of daring on the part both of the criminal and of the man who hunts him down. Here is nothing in itself 'sensational' in the popular acceptance of that word.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Therefore, when we speak of the detective story, and regard it seriously, we do not mean the penny-dreadfuls, the dime-novels, and the books which are hastily thrown together by some hack-writer of the 'Nick Carter' school, but the skillfully planned work of one who can construct and work out a complicated problem, definitely and convincingly. It must not be too complex; for here, as in all art, simplicity is the soul of genius. The story must appeal to our love of the mysterious, and it must be characterized by ingenuity, without transcending in the least the limits of the probable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a clear and rational definition of the Detective Story as we propose to consider it, and it seems to justify the acceptance of such stories as literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even in the complete absence of necessity for apology, we must consider the rightful place of the Mystery Story in fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is neither below nor above other types of story, but side by side with character studies, problem novels, society sketches or symbolic romances; and in so far as it fulfils the requirements of the best literature, just so far it is the best literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are bigoted and thoughtless critics who deny the Mystery Story any right to be considered as literature at all. But better judges are better pleased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote from a personal letter of Mr. Arlo Bates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;As to whether a Detective Story is literature, it seems to me that the question is not unlike asking whether a man with blue eyes is moral. No story ever took a place as literature on the strength of its plot. I am in the habit of telling my classes that one can no more judge the literary value of a novel from its plot, than one can judge of the beauty of a girl from an X-ray photograph of her skeleton. To exclude detective tales would be greatly to diminish the world's literary baggage.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Brander Matthews tells us in &quot;Inquiries and Opinions&quot; that &quot;Poe transported the detective story from the group of tales into the group of portrayals of character. By bestowing upon it a human interest, he raised it in the literary scale.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Matthews continues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Even at its best, in the simple perfection of form that Poe bestowed on it, there is no denying that the Detective Story demanded from its creator no depth of sentiment, no warmth of emotion, and no large understanding of human desire. There are those who would dismiss it carelessly, as making an appeal not far removed from that of the riddle and of the conundrum. There are those again who would liken it rather to the adroit trick of a clever conjurer. No doubt, it gratifies in us chiefly that delight in difficulty conquered, which is a part of the primitive play-impulse potent in us all, but tending to die out as we grow older, as we lessen in energy, and as we feel more deeply the tragi-comedy of existence. But inexpensive as it may seem to those of us who look to literature for enlightenment, for solace in the hour of need, for stimulus to stiffen the will in the never ending struggle of life, the detective tale, as Poe contrived it, has merits of its own as distinct and as undeniable, as those of the historical novel, for example, or of the sea-tale. It may please the young rather than the old, but the pleasure it can give is ever innocent; and the young are always in the majority.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps with his inerrant sense of terminology. Professor Matthews struck the right word when he called the Mystery Story inexpensive. It is that, but it is not necessarily cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indiscriminate critic who pronounces all detective stories trash, would be quite as logical and veracious should he call all love stories trash or all historical novels trash. The matter of a detective story is definite and easily invoiced; the manner allows scope as high as poetry or as deep as philosophy or as wide as romance. There is as true literature in Poe's detective stories as in Bacon's Essays, though of a different sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent well-known author published a book of clever detective stories anonymously. Asked why, he said that he considered the admission of its authorship beneath his literary dignity. &quot;Because,&quot; he explained, &quot;they are false to life and false to art.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a generalization, nothing could be more untrue. A detective story may be these things, but so may stories in any other field of fiction. It depends on the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to imply that a detective story is necessarily false to life and is false, per se, to art, is a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Julian Hawthorne's very able essay on this subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course 'The Gold Bug' is literature; of course any other story of mystery and puzzle is also literature, provided it is as good as 'The Gold Bug,'—or I will say, since that standard has never since been quite attained, provided it is a half or a tenth as good. It is goldsmith's work; it is Chinese carving; it is Daedalian; it is fine. It is the product of the ingenuity lobe of the human brain working and expatiating in freedom. It is art; not spiritual nor transcendental art but solid art, to be felt and experienced. You may examine it at your leisure, it will be always ready for you; you need not fast or watch your arms overnight in order to understand it. Look at the nice setting of the mortises; mark how the cover fits; how smooth is the working of that spring drawer. Observe that this bit of carving, which seemed mere ornament, is really a vital part of the mechanism. Note, moreover, how balanced and symmetrical the whole design is, with what economy and foresight every part is fashioned. It is not only an ingenious structure, it is a handsome bit of furniture, and will materially improve the looks of the empty chambers, or disorderly or ungainly chambers that you carry under your crown. Or if it happen that these apartments are noble in decoration and proportions, then this captivating little object will find a suitable place in some spare nook or other, and will rest or entertain eyes too long focused on the severely sublime and beautiful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-mystery-story-considered-as-art&quot;&gt;The Mystery Story Considered as Art&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the detective story at its best is primarily and integrally a work of art. It is like those Chinese carved balls, referred to by Tennyson as, &quot;Laborious orient ivory, sphere in sphere,&quot; and as the mystery story originated in the Orient, there may be some correlation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detective story has been called &quot;ingenious but somewhat mechanical.&quot; Here the stigma lies in the &quot;but.&quot; The detective story is ingenious and mechanical. On these two commandments hang all the laws of mystery fiction writing. Also ingenious and mechanical are the Fixed Forms of verse. Who denies the beauty and art of sonnets and rondeaux, and even sestinas, because they are ingenious and mechanical?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the mosaic worker in Florence picks out his colored bits with utmost skill, care and patience, so the worker in Fixed Forms selects his words and fits them into his inexorable pattern until he achieves his perfect and exquisite result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heraldic devices are not &quot;artistic&quot; in the accepted sense of the word, but they are an art in themselves; ingenious and mechanical, but still art. The Heraldic lions in front of the New York Public Library may not be true to nature's lions, may not be true to a poetic imagination of a lion, but they are true to the laws of the conventional lion of heraldry, and are therefore art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oriental embroidery is art as much as an impressionist picture, though of a different type, and characterized by ingenuity and mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, as Lowell says, &quot;genius finds its expression in the establishment of a perfect mutual understanding between the worker and his material,&quot; then we can exclude no serious endeavors from the possibility of being art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the qualities of ingenuity and mechanism are peculiarly fitted to bring about the establishment of just such an understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-claims-of-antagonists-and-protagonists&quot;&gt;The Claims of Antagonists and Protagonists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason for a sweeping denouncement of the detective story is the innate propensity of the human mind for bluffing at intellect. Many people would be glad to admit a taste for mystery fiction, but tradition tells them that such things are but child's play, while a love of ethics or metaphysics betokens a great mind. Ashamed then, of their honest liking for puzzle solving, they deny it, and pretend a deep interest in subjects which really mean little or nothing to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;How can you read such stuff?&quot; they ask in shocked tones of the puzzle lover, who, with alert brain and bright eyes, is galloping through &quot;The Mystery of the Deserted Wing,&quot; and then they turn with a virtuous yawn, back to the uncut pages of the erudite tome through which they are plodding their weary way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the truly great intellect who understands and knows whereof he thinks, the above does not apply. But so long as men are unwilling to be caught in a liking for &quot;child's play,&quot; and so long as women yearn after that smattering of abstruse literature which represents to them &quot;a breadth of culture,&quot; so long will the detective story be ostentatiously denounced on the corners of the streets, and eagerly devoured behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are plenty of people of real intelligence who have no taste for Mystery Stories. This proves nothing, for there are also plenty of people of real intelligence who like them. Again we might as well ask, &quot;Does a blue eyed man like cherries?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as many people are fond of the authority of the good and great, let us be definite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a personal letter. President Woodrow Wilson writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The fact is. I'm an indiscriminate reader of detective stories and would be at a loss to pick out my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On the whole I have got the most authentic thrill out of Anna Katharine Green's books and Gaboriau's.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. William J. Rolfe, the famous Shakespearian editor, was exceedingly fond of Mystery Stories and puzzles of all sorts. He especially revelled in the books of charades written by his friend and colleague. Professor William Bellamy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the hasty and inconsiderate judgment that relegates all detective fiction to the trash-pile, might be modified by the knowledge of the college professors and deep-thinking scholars who turn to detective stories for recreation and enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well known member of the English Parliament has such a taste for detective literature that his friend speaks thus of him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The weighty work in which the eminent statesman is so deeply engrossed,&quot; he said, &quot;is called 'The Great Rand Robbery.1 It is a detective novel, for sale at all bookstalls.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The American raised his eyebrows in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'The Great Rand Robbery?&quot;' he repeated, incredulously. &quot;What an odd taste!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is not a taste, it is his vice,&quot; returned the gentleman with the pearl stud. &quot;It is his one dissipation. He is noted for it. You, as a stranger, could hardly be expected to know of this idiosyncrasy. Mr. Gladstone sought relaxation in the Greek poets. Sir Andrew finds his in Ga- boriau. Since I have been a member of Parliament, I have never seen him in the library without a shilling shocker in his hands. He brings them even into the sacred precincts of the House, and from the Government benches reads them concealed inside his hat. Once started on a tale of murder, robbery, and sudden death, nothing can tear him from it, not even the call of the division-bell, nor of hunger, nor the prayers of the party Whip. He gave up his country house because when he journeyed to it in the train he would become so absorbed in his detective stories that he was invariably carried past his station.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps such an inordinate relish is not to be entirely commended, but the fact remains that an analytical mentality gets an intense enjoyment out of the solving of puzzles or mysteries, that a differently constituted brain cannot in the least understand or appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all comes back to the incontrovertible philosophy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Different men are of different opinions. Some like apples, some like inions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this same thought Henry James voices thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In a recent story, 'The Beldonald Holbein,1 it is not my fault if I am so put together as often to find more life in situations obscure and subject to interpretation than in the gross rattle of the foreground.&quot; One could not find a more luminous comment upon his short stories than these words contain. The situations that he prefers are, as he says, &quot;obscure&quot; but &quot;subject to interpretation.&quot; Hawthorne's situations, however, even when obscure, are always vital. We cannot imagine Hawthorne saying, as James says, &quot;It is an incident for a woman to stand up with her hand resting on a table and look out at you in a certain way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, then, Mr. James gets exquisite satisfaction out of the careful consideration of this incident, why may not another equally great intellect become absorbed in finding out who stole the jewels?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The curiosity aroused by Mystery Fiction is not then, a mere idle curiosity but an intellectual interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Technique of the Novel&quot; Prof. Chas. F. Horne thus discusses the mystery story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This is the tale of the Improbable, the story that depends chiefly upon plot, external or action plot. It deals with surprise, with mystery, with the unexpected. It sees truth perhaps, but only the oddities of truth, where verity fixes a feeble hope upon coincidence, or upon ignorance, and usually gropes blindly toward that comfortable travesty of material payment for immaterial efforts which man miscalls 'poetic justice'. Such a novel may be either:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;1. The story of fear, which holds the excited reader shivering in darkness, by means of hinted horrors or by spectres frankly visible. Such visions haunt the 'Castle of Otranto' and Mrs. Radcliffe's more elaborate work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;2. The story of intrigue, of cunning bad folks and rather idiotic good ones, of subtle schemes, intricate knaveries, and surprising secrets coming to light at just the dramatic moment needful for the triumph of virtue and defeat of vice. If one may do so without seeming to belittle the work, I would suggest 'Tom Jones' as showing the perfection of this sort of plot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;3. The detective story, in which the plot is deliberately presented upside down. Consequences are first shown, and then worked backward to their causes, the steps being all suggested, yet made as unexpected as possible, that the reader may exercise his own wits and join the detective in an effort to solve the riddle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;4. The novel of the unknown, the story of strange suggestion, which reaches beyond man's knowledge of his cosmos, not to terrify and amaze, but to analyze and understand, to suggest possibilities and questions, to see human nature in new lights, as Hawthorne does in &quot;Sep- timius Felton,&quot; or Mr. Wells in his 'War with Mars'.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;a-working-classification&quot;&gt;A Working Classification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is obvious that the various types or kinds of mystery story cannot be classified with exactness; so they may be generally divided into three groups—a broad classification which will best suit our purpose: Ghost stories. Riddle stories, and Detective stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the earliest literature the supernatural was a strong element. Its appeal was not only to curiosity, but equally if not more to wonder, awe, and terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In safe surroundings, people like to be frightened. The baby crows with delight when we jump at him and say, &quot;boo!&quot; Children huddle together in ecstasy when listening to bugaboo tales; and grown-ups read and write ghost stories with intense enjoyment of their inexplicable horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though detective stories may receive an unjust opprobrium, yet ghost stories are admitted to the inner circles of literature and art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the days of the Witch of Endor, the superhuman personage has had an exalted place in literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shakespeare, Dickens, and Washington Irving number among their characters ghosts who became famous. And in latter days, Henry James, Rudyard Kipling and F. Marion Crawford have given us ghosts well worthy of their literary predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story founded on the supernatural is a distinct branch of the Mystery Story, and except for the principle of Question and Answer, has little in common with the other two branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-ghost-story&quot;&gt;The Ghost Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fascination of this realm of experience, which is traditional from age to age, yet always elusive, is undeniable. Few men have seen ghosts, or will confess that they have seen them. But almost everybody knows some one of the few. Haunted houses are familiar in all neighborhoods, with the same story of the roistering sceptic who will gladly pass the night alone in the haunted chamber, and give monsieur the ghost a warm welcome; but who, if not found dead in the morning, emerges pale and haggard, with a settled terror in his look, and his lips sealed forever upon the awful story of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mansions in country places are advertised for sale or hire, with the attraction of a well regulated ghost, who contents himself until driving up at midnight with a great clatter of outriders, and rumble of wheels, and brisk letting down of steps, and a bustling entrance into the house, and then no more. Staid gentlemen remember in their youth awaking in a friend's house in the summer night just in time to see the vanishing through the long window of a draped figure; a momentary pausing on the balcony outside; the sense of a penetrating, mournful look; then a vanishing; and at breakfast the cheery question of the host, &quot;Did you see the lovely Lady Rosamond?&quot; and a following tale of hapless love and woe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As George William Curtis tells us, in &quot;Modern Ghosts&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The literature of ghosts is very ancient. In visions of the night and in the lurid vapors of mystic incantations, figures rise and smile or frown and disappear. The Witch of Endor murmurs her spell and 'an old man cometh up, and he is covered with a mantle.' Macbeth takes a bond of fate, and from Hecate's caldron, after the apparition of an armed head and that of a bloody child, 'an apparition of a child crowned, with a tree in his hand, rises.'&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The wizard recounts to Lochiel his warning vision, and Lochiel departs to his doom. There are stories of the Castle of Otranto and of the Three Spaniards, and the infinite detail of 'singular experiences,' which make our conscious daily life the frontier and border and of an impinging world of mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The most refined psychological speculation may extend the range of observation. But the 'mocking laughter1 of desert places, the cry of the banshee, the sudden impression of a presence, the strange and fanciful popular superstitions, as they are called, in the same way that un- apprehended physical conditions are sagely called nervous prostration—what is the key to them all? What is a hallucination? Who shall say conclusively that it is the thing that is not? And if it be, whence is it, and why?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the technical Ghost Story, as we shall now consider it, the question is certain to arise; &quot;What was It?&quot; And the answer must be &quot;A ghost!&quot;—that is an inexplicable supernatural manifestation of some sort. A rational and material explanation, as of a human being impersonating ghost, or, a mechanical contrivance responsible for mysterious sounds, takes the story out of this class at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kipling's tale called &quot;My own true ghost story&quot; is not a ghost story at all; it is an exceedingly interesting riddle story. But &quot;The Phantom 'Rickshaw&quot; by the same author is one of the best of ghost stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not only must the ghost be a real ghost, but the effect of the supernatural must permeate the whole story, the people being thus more real by contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the reader be the strictest materialist, he must, to enjoy a ghost story, put himself in an attitude of belief in the supernatural for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Julian Hawthorne says, in &quot;The Lock and key library&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A ghost story can be brought into our charmed and charming circle only if we have made up our minds to believe in the ghosts; otherwise their introduction would not be a square deal. It would not be fair, in other words, to propose a conundrum on a basis of ostensible materialism, and then, when no other key would fit, to palm off a disembodied spirit on us. Tell me beforehand that your scenario is to include both worlds, and I have no objection to make; I simply attune my mind to the more extensive scope. But I rebel at an unheralded ghostland, and declare frankly that your tale is incredible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miss Wilkins' story, &quot;The Shadow on the Wall,&quot; is a perfect Ghost Story, told in a perfect way. There is no material explanation, the shadow on the wall has its own awful meaning, and the commonplace setting of the story throws into relief the weirdness of the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With ghosts really seen by real people, the fictional Ghost Story has nothing in common. Hundreds of ghosts are annually brought to light in the dragnets of scientific spook catchers. But while these ghosts are interesting in and of themselves, they lack the setting of the Ghost Story of fiction, and without attempting to discuss the truth or falsity of their existence we fall back upon the assertion that a ghost belongs to the category of things naturally incredible. Notwithstanding the subconscious faith that all of us have in the possibility of phantoms, our reason refuses to accept them without proof much more conclusive than we should demand for the establishment of an every-day fact. So extreme is our reluctance to believe in such phenomena that the average man of education, if he saw a spectre with his own eyes, would, on referring the matter to his judgment, prefer to regard the apparition as an illusion, rather than accept it as a supernatural manifestation. The chances are, too, that he would be correct, inasmuch as hallucinations of vision are undeniably frequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep down in the heart of man there abides a firm belief in the power of the dead to walk upon the earth, and affright, if such be their pleasure, the souls of the living. Wise folks, versed in the sciences and fortified in mind against faith in aught that savors of the supernatural, laugh ideas of the kind to scorn; yet hardly one of them will dare to walk alone through a graveyard in the night. Or, if one be found so bold, he will surely hasten his footsteps, unable wholly to subdue the fear of sheeted spectres which may rise from the grass-grown graves, or emerge from moon-lit tombs, and follow on. For, strangely enough, the dead, if not actually hostile to the living, are esteemed dangerous and dreadful to encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real-life ghost story is largely made up of vehement protestations on the part of the narrator that &quot;This really happened,&quot; and flat-footed inquiries as to &quot;How do you explain it, if you don't believe in ghosts!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Ghost Story of fiction tranquilly takes the belief in ghosts for granted, and goes on to create delightfully harrowing conditions, an atmosphere of deepest mystery and a problem unsolvable, except by the acceptance of a ghost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ghost need not be an actual character, not even an entity; it may be an impalpable shadow, or an invisible form. Or it may be, as in one story, a fearful pair of eyes that scared the hero of the tale,—and incidentally the reader,—much farther out of his wits than any conventional spectre clanking his chains might do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet it is the strange fascination of this fear that attracts the reader to a ghost story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;famous-ghost-stories&quot;&gt;Famous Ghost Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;What Was It?&quot; by Fitzjames O'Brien, is a typical Ghost Story of horror. The dreadfulness of the experience is graphically pictured and the hold on the reader's attention is entirely that of the supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A parallel story is Maupassant's &quot;The Horla.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latter story is much longer and more elaborate, but the plots are almost identical. The Frenchman's story is told with a greater art, but is spun out to too great a length, and in some parts the horror is mere hysteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among Ghost Stories with an occult moral, Kipling's &quot;They&quot; stands pre-eminent. This story has the element of beauty rather than horror, but it is a perfect Ghost Story none the less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Turn of The Screw&quot; is a wonderful Ghost Story. The supernatural element of its matter, aided by the supernatural element in Henry James' manner is a combination that makes a Ghost Story of distinguishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For stories of sheer hair-raising horror, F. Marion Crawford's Ghost Stories stand easily in the first rank. &quot;The upper berth&quot; is quite as terrifying a conception as the stories of O'Brien and Maupassant, but the descriptive details give an atmosphere of fright unattained by the other two. As an example of Mr. Crawford's awful word pictures we append the following extracts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The light was growing strangely dim in the great room.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As Evelyn looked. Nurse Mcdonald's crooked shadow on the wall grew gigantic. Sir Hugh's breath came thick, rattling in his throat, as death crept in like a snake and choked it back. Evelyn prayed aloud, high and clear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Then something rapped at the window, and she felt her hair rise upon her head in a cool breeze, as she looked around in spite of herself. And when she saw her own white face looking in at the window, and her own eyes staring at her through the glass, wide and fearful, and her own hair streaming against the pane, and her own lips dashed with blood, she rose slowly from the floor and stood rigid for one moment, till she screamed once and fell straight back into Gabriel's arms. But the shriek that answered hers was the fear shriek of the tormented corpse, out of which the soul cannot pass for shame of deadly sins, though the devils fight in it with corruption, each for their due share.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sir Hugh Ockram sat upright in his deathbed, and saw and cried loud.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Slowly Nurse Macdonald's wrinkled eyelids folded themselves back, and she looked straight at the face at the window while one might count ten.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Is it time?&quot; she asked in her little old, far away voice. While she looked the face at the window changed, for the eyes opened wider and wider till the white glared all round the bright violet, and the bloody lips opened over gleaming teeth, and stretched and widened and stretched again, and the shadowy golden hair rose and streamed against the window in the night breeze. And in answer to Nurse Macdonald's question came the sound that freezes the living flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That low moaning voice that rises suddenly, like the scream of storm, from a moan to a wail, from a wail to a howl, from a howl to the fear shriek of the tortured dead—he who has heard knows, and he can bear witness that the cry of the banshee is an evil cry to hear alone in the deep night.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He was as brave as any of those dead men had been, and they were his fathers, and he knew that sooner or later he should lie there himself, beside Sir Hugh, slowly drying to a parchment shell. But he was still alive, and he closed his eyes a moment, and three great drops stood on his forehead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Then he looked again, and by the whiteness of the winding-sheet he knew his father's corpse, for all the others were brown with age; and, moreover, the flame of the candle was blown toward it. He made four steps till he reached it, and suddenly the light burned straight and high, shedding a dazzling yellow glare upon the fine linen that was all white, save over the face, and where the joined hands were laid on the breast. And at those places ugly stains had spread, darkened with outlines of the features and of the tight-clasped fingers. There was a frightful stench of drying death.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As Sir Gabriel looked down, something stirred behind him, softly at first, then more noisily, and something fell to the stone floor with a dull thud and rolled up to his feet; he started back and saw a withered head lying almost face upward on the pavement, grinning at him. He felt the cold sweat standing on his face, and his heart beat painfully.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For the first time in all his life that evil thing which men call fear was getting hold of him, checking his heartstrings as a cruel driver checks a quivering horse, clawing at his backbone with icy hands, lifting his hair with freezing breath, climbing up and gathering in his midriff with leaden weight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Yet presently he bit his lip and bent down, holding the candle in one hand, to lift the shroud back from the head of the corpse with the other. Slowly he lifted it. Then it clove to the half-dried skin of the face, and his hand shook as if some one had struck him on the elbow, but half in fear and half in anger at himself, he pulled it, so that it came away with a little ripping sound. He caught his breath as he held it, not yet throwing it back, and not yet looking. The horror was working in him, and he felt that old Vernon Ockram was standing up in his iron coffin, headless, yet watching him with the stump of his severed neck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While he held his breath he felt the dead smile twisting his lips. In sudden wrath at his own misery, he tossed the death-stained linen backward, and looked at last. He ground his teeth lest he should shriek aloud.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps unique amongst Ghost Stories is the one by Mr. Crawford entitled &quot;The Doll's Ghost.&quot; It would seem difficult to conceive a story of the ghost of a little girl's doll, that should be neither melodramatic nor ridiculous, but Mr. Crawford accomplished this, and the little sketch, while a true Ghost Story, is pathetic and charming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-humorous-ghost-story&quot;&gt;The Humorous Ghost Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rarely, and only in the hands of a master, may a Ghost Story be treated with levity. The humorous touch is dangerous in connection with the supernatural. But the whimsical genius of Frank R. Stockton surmounted all difficulties and gave us two delicious humorous Ghost Stories, of which we quote a few lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The figure was certainly that of John Hinckman in his ordinary dress, but there was a vagueness and indistinctness about it which presently assured me that it was a ghost. Had the good old man been murdered, and had his spirit come to tell me of the deed, and to confide to me the protection of his dear—? My heart fluttered but I felt that I must speak. &quot;Sir,&quot; said I.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you know,&quot; interrupted the figure, with a countenance that indicated anxiety, &quot;whether or not Mr. Hinckman will return to-night?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I thought it well to maintain a calm exterior, and I answered:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We do not expect him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I am glad of that,&quot; said he, sinking into the chair by which he stood. &quot;During the two years and a half that I have inhabited this house, that man has never before been away for a single night. You can't imagine the relief it gives me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As he spoke, he stretched out his legs and leaned back in the chair. His form became less vague, and the colors of his garments more distinct and evident, while an expression of gratified relief succeeded to the anxiety of his countenance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Two years and a half!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;I don't understand you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is fully that length of time,&quot; said the ghost, &quot;since I first came here. Mine is not an ordinary case.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The ghost smiled.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I must admit, however,&quot; he said, &quot;that I am seeking this position for a friend of mine, and I have reason to believe that he will obtain it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Good heavens!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;Is it possible that this house is to he haunted by a ghost as soon as the old gentleman expires? Why should this family be tormented in such a horrible way? Everybody who dies does not have a ghost walking about his house.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, no!&quot; said the spectre. &quot;There are thousands of positions of the kind which are never applied for. But the ghostship here is a very desirable one, and there are many applicants for it. I think you will like my friend, if he gets it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Like him!&quot; I groaned.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The idea was horrible to me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The ghost evidently perceived how deeply I was affected by what he had said, for there was a compassionate expression on his countenance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I drew my chair a little nearer to her, and as I did so the ghost burst into the room from the doorway behind her. I say burst, although no door flew open and he made no noise. He was wildly excited, and waved his arms above his head. The moment I saw him, my heart fell within me. With the entrance of that impertinent apparition, every hope fled from me. I could not speak while he was in the room.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I must have turned pale, and I gazed steadfastly at the ghost, almost without seeing Madeline, who sat between us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you know,&quot; he cried, &quot;that John Hinckman is coming up the hill. He will be here in fifteen minutes, and if you are doing anything in the way of love-making, you had better hurry it up. But this is not what I came to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I have glorious news! At last I am transferred! Not forty minutes ago a Russian nobleman as murdered by the Nihilists. Nobody ever thought of him in connection with an immediate ghostship. My friends instantly applied for the situation for me, and obtained my transfers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To trace the origin and history of the mystery story is simply to trace the origin and history of man's mind. Mystery stories were told and wonder tales invented before the days of old Rameses, before the Sphinx was hewn or Samson born. And indeed the rousing of latent curiosity, the tempting with a promise to divulge, which is the vital principle of the mystery story, began no later than with the subtlety of the Primal Serpent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no country which has not its quota of traditional and folk-lore tales, founded almost invariably on some element of mystery, surprise or suspense. And why? Because the interest of the eternal audience is &quot;gripped&quot; by a desire to know the unknown. Because the ancients told and retold stories of mystery with never failing success. These tales lived. Translated, rewritten, paraphrased, they are still living, because of their ever new appeal to the very human trait of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;ancient-mystery-tales&quot;&gt;Ancient Mystery Tales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the story of &quot;The Clever Thief.&quot; It comes from the Tibetan, from an ancient Buddhist book that goes back nearly a thousand years. But even then it was not new. Missionaries had carried it thither from India in an odd corner of their bags, or in some chamber of the memory not filled with the riddles of being. Where did they get it? Who can say? It was old when Herodotus wandered through sun-lit Egypt twenty-four centuries ago, gleaning tales from the priests of Amen and of Ptah. He tells it, point for point, as did those Buddhist missionaries, but lays it in the days of Rameses, nigh four thousand years ago. Everything is there; the cutting off of the head to elude detection, the tricks by which the relatives mourn over the headless trunk, the snare set for the thief and his outwitting it. And that same tale, like good merchandise, was carried both east and west. It found its way to India, over the vast Himalayas, to the gray roof of the world. It came with equal charm to the Mediterranean isles, up the Adriatic coasts, and as far as Venice. There Ser Giovanni told it, transmogrifying Pharaoh of the Nile into a worshipful Doge, as he had already been made over into a Buddhist magnate, but in no way altering the motive, the suspense, the artfulness of the tale. What is this story then? Is it Venetian? Is it Pharonic? Is it Greek? Is it Tibetan? It is all these, and perhaps something more, vastly older than them all. Its craft, mayhap, goes back tot that primal serpent who, more subtle than all the beasts of the field, has ever inspired darkling feints and strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories whose motive is a subtly discerned clew are not less primordial. The most vivid of these tales of deduction are, perhaps, those which come to us through the Arabs, in their treasure store, &quot;The thousand and one nights.&quot; The Arabs gleaned them from every land in southern Asia, and from most ancient Egypt, in those days when Moslem power overshadowed half the world. And then they retold them with a charm, a vivid freshness, a roguishness, and a dash of golden light through it all that make them the finest story-tellers in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we fix the dates of these Arabian stories? Only in a general way. Some of them came from Cairo, some from Syria, some from the Euphrates and Tigris Valley, some from Persia and India and China; and they were gathered together, it would appear, in the century before Shakespeare was born, by some big-hearted, humorous fellow, among the great anonymous benefactors of mankind. But he made no claim of inventing them. If he had he would have been laughed at for his pains. For old men had heard them from their grandfathers, generation after generation, and the gray grandsires always began to tell them, saying: &quot;So 'twas told to me when I was such a tiny child as thou art.11&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though many of these tales excite merely wonder and surprise, others have the germ of that analytic deduction from inconspicuous clues, that we call ratiocination, or the detective instinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an Arabic story, called &quot;The Sultan and his Three Sons.&quot; From this we quote two illuminative passages which employ the principle of deductive analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And they stinted not faring till the middle way, when behold they came upon a mead abounding in herbage and in rain-water lying sheeted. So they sat them down to rest and to eat of their victual, when one of the brothers, casting his eye upon the herbage, cried, &quot;Verily a camel hath lately passed this way laden half with Halwa-sweet- meats and half with Hamiz-pickles.&quot; &quot;True,&quot; cried the second, &quot;and he was blind of an eye.&quot; Hardly, however, had they ended their words when lo! the owner of the camel came upon them (for he had overheard their speech and had said to himself, &quot;By Allah, these three fellows have driven off my property, inasmuch as they have described the burden and eke the beast as one- eyed&quot;) and cried out, &quot;Ye three have carried away my camel!&quot; &quot;By Allah we have not seen him,&quot; quoth the Princes, &quot;much less have we touched him;&quot; but quoth the man, &quot;By the Almighty, who could have taken him except you? and if you will not deliver him to me, off with us, I and you three, to the Sultan.&quot; They replied, &quot;By all manner of means; let us wend to the sovereign.&quot; So the four hied forth, the three princes and the Cameleer, and ceased not faring till they reached the capital of the King.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Presently, asked the Sultan, &quot;What say ye to the claims of this man and the camel belonging to him?&quot; Hereto the Princes made answer, &quot;By Allah, O King of the Age, we have not seen the camel much less have we stolen him.&quot; Thereupon the Cameleer exclaimed, &quot;O my lord, I heard yonder one say that the beast was blind of an eye; and the second said that half his load was of sour stuff.&quot; They replied, &quot;true, we spake these words;&quot; and the Sultan cried to them, &quot;Ye have purloined the beast, by this proof.&quot; They rejoined, &quot;No, by Allah, O my Lord. We sat us in such a place for repose and refreshment and we remarked that some of the pasture had been grazed down, so we said: This is the grazing of a camel; and he must have been blind of one eye as the grass was eaten only on one side. But as for our saying that the load was half Halwa-sweetmeats and half Hamiz-pickles, we saw on the place where the camel had knelt the flies gathering in great numbers while on the other were none; so the case was clear to us (as flies settle on naught save the sugared) that one of the panniers must have contained sweets and the other sours.&quot; hearing this the Sultan said to the Cameleer, &quot;O man, fare thee forth and look after they camel; for these signs and tokens prove not the theft of these men, but only the power of their intellect and their penetration.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later Voltaire used this method for his &quot;Zadig,&quot; Poe for his &quot;Dupin,&quot; and Gaboriau for his &quot;M. Lecoq;&quot; while later still it reappeared as the basis of the &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of &quot;The Visakha&quot; is nearly a thousand years old, but the following quotation will prove that the element of acute observation is the same as that described in a previous story proving the wisdom of Solomon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After she had taken charge of the boy the father died. A dispute arose between the two women as to the possession of the house, each of them asserting that it belonged to her. They had recourse to the King. He ordered his ministers to go to the house and to make inquiries as to the ownership of the son. They investigated the matter, but the day came to an end before they had brought it to a satisfactory conclusion. In the evening they returned to their homes. Visakha again questioned Mrgadhara, who told her everything. Visakha said, &quot;What need is there of investigation? Speak to the two women thus: 'As we do not know to which of you two the boy belongs, let her who is the strongest take the boy.1 When each of them has taken hold of one of the boy's hands, and he begins to cry out on account of the pain, the real mother will let go, being full of compassion for him, and knowing that if her child remains alive she will be able to see it again; but the other, who has no compassion for him, will not let go. Then beat her with a switch, and she will thereupon confess the truth as to the whole matter. That is the proper test.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mrgadhara told this to the ministers, and so forth, as is written above, down to the words, &quot;The king said, 'The Champa maiden is wise.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;riddle-stories&quot;&gt;RIDDLE STORIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riddle Stories, as we have chosen to designate them, are Mystery Stories concerned with a question and answer of absorbing interest, but one which in no way implies or includes the work of a detective, either professional or amateur. As a rule, Riddle Stories are not based upon a crime, but on some mysterious situation which is apparently inexplicable, but which turns out to have a most rational and logical explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;some-notable-riddle-stories&quot;&gt;Some Notable Riddle Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Sending Of Dana Da&quot; by Kipling, is one of the best stories of this type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have such a commonplace, ordinary medium as kittens, so employed as to make an unsolvable riddle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When a man who hates cats wakes up in the morning and finds a little squirming kitten on his breast, or puts his hand into his ulster pocket and finds a little half-dead kitten where his gloves should be, or opens his trunk and finds a vile kitten among his dress shirts or goes for a long ride with his mackintosh strapped on his saddlebow and shakes a little sprawling kitten from its folds when he opens it, or goes out to dinner and finds a little blind kitten under his chair, or stays at home and finds a writhing kitten under the quilt, or wriggling among his boots, or hanging, head downward, in his tobacco jar, or being mangled by his terrier in the veranda—when such a man finds one kitten, neither more nor less, once a day in a place where no kitten rightly could or should be, he is naturally upset. When he dare not murder his daily trove because he believes it to be a manifestation, an emissary, an embodiment, and half a dozen other things all out of the regular course of nature, he is more than upset. He is actually distressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one could know the truth until told and the explanation is entirely logical and satisfactory. Indeed, as the author says, finally: &quot;Consider the gorgeous simplicity of it all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clever Riddle Story is one by Cleveland Moffett, entitled &quot;The Mysterious Card.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this story, a New Yorker, while in a Paris restaurant, is presented with a card by a charming and richly clad lady. The card bore some French words written in purple ink, but not knowing that language he was unable to make out their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He returned at once to his hotel to inquire concerning the message on the card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of the story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Proceeding directly to the office and taking the manager aside, Burwell asked if he would be kind enough to translate a few words of French into English. There were no more than twenty words in all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Why, certainly,&quot; said the manager, with French politeness, and cast his eyes over the card. As he read, his face grew rigid with astonishment, and, looking at his questioner sharply, he exclaimed: &quot;Where did you get this, monsieur?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Burwell started to explain, but was interrupted by: &quot;That will do, that will do. You must leave the hotel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked the man from New York, in amazement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You must leave the hotel now—to-night—without fail,&quot; commanded the manager, excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Now it was Burwell1 s turn to grow angry, and he declared heatedly that if he wasn't wanted in this hotel there were plenty of others in Paris where he would be welcome. And, with an assumption of dignity, but piqued at heart, he settled his bill, sent for his belongings, and drove up the Rue de la Paix to the Hotel Bellevue, where he spent the night. The next morning he met the proprietor, who seemed to be a good fellow, and, being inclined now to view the incident of the previous evening from its ridiculous side, Burwell explained what had befallen him, and was pleased to find a sympathetic listener.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Why, the man was a fool,&quot; declared the proprietor. &quot;Let me see the card; I will tell you what it means.&quot; But as he read, his face and manner changed instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a serious matter,&quot; he said sternly. &quot;Now I understand why my confrere refused to entertain you. I regret, monsieur, but I shall be obliged to do as he did.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you mean?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Simply that you cannot remain here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With that he turned on his heel, and the indignant guest could not prevail upon him to give any explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We'll see about this,&quot; said Burwell, thoroughly angered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the story is a succession of the hero's unfortunate experiences in endeavoring to solve the mystery of the card. He referred it to his dearest friend, to a detective agency, to the American Minister, and finally to his wife, but in every case the reader of the card turned from him in horror and dismay and refused to see or speak to him again. In the sequel to the story, called &quot;The Mysterious Card Unveiled&quot; the mystery is explained to the satisfaction of the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the best Riddle Story of its kind ever written is that masterpiece of Frank R. Stockton, &quot;The Lady or The Tiger?&quot; but this principle of leaving a question unanswered is not to be advised for any writer not possessing Stockton's peculiar genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as short-stories, there are many entire novels with a mystery interest but which are in no sense Detective Stories. &quot;The Woman In White&quot; is a good example. This book is said to have been the most popular serial story ever printed. On the publication day of the weekly in which the story was appearing in parts, the street in front of the office was thronged with people anxiously waiting for a new instalment of the adventures of Laura Fairleigh, Ann Catherick, the treacherous Baronet, and the diabolically fascinating Count Fosco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secret of Collins's power lies not in mere description but in suggestion. He excites us not by what he tells us but what he does not tell us. The compelling interest which holds the reader of &quot;The Woman In White&quot; is due less to the vivid description of dramatic incidents than to the artful suggestion of some impending fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-nature-of-the-riddle-story-and-its-types&quot;&gt;The Nature of the Riddle Story and its Types&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distinguishing feature of the Riddle Story is that the reader should be confronted with a number of mysterious facts of which the explanation is reserved till the end. Now this reservation of the final solution, in order to pique the reader's curiosity, excite his ingenuity, and lead him on to an unexpected climax, is a quite legitimate artistic effect. The only question to be asked about it in any particular instance is whether it succeeds, whether the effect is really accomplished? And for its success two primary qualifications are necessary,—first, that the mystery should really be mysterious; second, that the explanation should really explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Riddle Story, then, is based entirely on a puzzle whose solution is a clever trick of the author and usually not to be guessed by the reader. Unlike the Detective Story, there are no clues, either true or misleading. The reader goes swiftly from his first surprise to sustained wonder, and then to an intense and abiding curiosity that lasts until the solution is flashed upon him. The plot is meant to catch the reader napping, and seldom indeed is he wide awake enough to solve the riddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distinct type of Riddle Story is that which describes a search for lost treasure. In so far as the searchers encounter mysterious conditions, or the reader is held in suspense concerning the meaning or outcome of the situations, in so far is the tale a Riddle Story. But to be a real Riddle Story, the mystery must be carefully built up, sustained and finally revealed with careful and coherent sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe's story, &quot;The Oblong Box,&quot; is one of the greatest Riddle Stories ever written. The mystery is seemingly inexplicable. The interest is intense and the conditions partake of all the elements of ghastliness and horror. The solution is unguessable but entirely logical, and Poe's inimitable workmanship makes the story a masterpiece of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally clever, in a totally different vein, is Kipling's &quot;His Wedded Wife,&quot; and, different still, Aldrich's &quot;Marjory Daw.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both of these, the surprise is perfect, and so inherent a part of the plot, so skillfully and swiftly worked up, that all demands of the true Riddle Story are complied with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some Riddle Stories the interest is not in the unraveling of the web, but in the weaving of it. In De Quincey's &quot;The Avenger&quot; this is the case, and also in Bulwer's &quot;A Strange Story.&quot; It is the strangeness of the story that captivates in these instances. The maze of mystery and hazard, and the confidence that it will all be made plain to us at last, provide sufficient charm to the lover of the Riddle Story. Crime and its detection have no part here, but mystery and paradox reign supreme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another sort of Riddle Story employs the cypher or cryptogram plot, but this is of such importance as to require a chapter to itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe's &quot;Gold Bug&quot; includes both the cryptogram and the buried treasure, and is of course the greatest story built upon either or both of these plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A novel by James DeMille is called &quot;The Cryptogram,&quot; and the cypher is the main point of the story. But more often, cypher or secret writing is used as a side issue or a picturesque device in a stronger mystery plot.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">To trace the origin and history of the mystery story is simply to trace the origin and history of man&amp;#39;s mind. Mystery stories were told and wonder tales invented before the days of old Rameses, before the Sphinx was hewn or Samson born. And indeed the rousing of latent curiosity, the tempting with a promise to divulge, which is the vital principle of the mystery story, began no later than with the subtlety of the Primal Serpent.</summary>

&lt;p class=&quot;firstpara&quot;&gt;Pick up any mystery novel and you're presented with a mystery beyond the one on the pages of the book or short story you've selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first mystery is what kind of mystery story are you holding? From amateur detectives to whounits, a vast expanse of styles, types, subgenres and schools of mystery, crime, and detective stories abound. For any fan, whatever flavor of mystery they most enjoy, it is a vital skill to be able to discern the minute differences between Cozy and Golden Age, or the classic whodunit vs. the howdunit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a selection of the most prominent subgenres, schools, and types of mystery fiction. While it may be simplest to find the larger categories in which to drop a story, most great mystery fiction takes elements from more than one category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you find the clues in your story to accurately determine in which category or categories it belongs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;amateur-detective&quot;&gt;Amateur Detective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An amateur detective mystery is one in which the main character pursuing the mystery is not a professional detective but is instead an everyday person, perhaps a housewife or casual friend of the victim or suspect who takes it upon himself or herself solve the mystery. The detective may be pursuing the case as part of a profession, like a reporter, doctor or lawyer. However, the key aspect of amateur detective fiction is that the sleuth does not formally work as any kind of private or police detective. The detecting is subsequent to his primary role or career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples include Father Brown, a Catholic priest and hero of 51 detective short stories by G. K. Chesterton; Nancy Drew, a high school girl created by Edward Statemeyer; Miss Marple, of Agatha Christie's novels; and Lord Peter Wimsey, a wealthy English gentleman, created by Dorothy L. Sayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called an &lt;em&gt;am sleuth&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;am detective&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;ancientprehistoric-aka-pre-poe&quot;&gt;Ancient/prehistoric (aka, pre-Poe)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Edgar Allen Poe is generally credited with creating the modern mystery story and the modern detective, his &lt;em&gt;Murders on the Rue Morgue&lt;/em&gt; (1841) are not the first mystery stories written. As far back as Ancient Greece and Rome, audiences have been fascinated by murder and the pursuit of justice for the victim. Sophocles, among other Greek dramatists, spun yarns of murder, including his play &lt;em&gt;Oedipus the King&lt;/em&gt; (first performed around 429 B.C.E).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Renaissance Period in Europe, as the general public learned to read, sensationalized reports of villains' capture, trials, imprisonment and execution titillated the masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other stories, like &quot;The Three Apples&quot; from &lt;em&gt;One Thousand and One Arabian Nights&lt;/em&gt; (800-1300), Thomas De Quincy's &quot;On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts&quot; published in &lt;em&gt;Blackwood's Magazine&lt;/em&gt; in 1827, and E. T. A. Hoffman's novella &lt;em&gt;Das Fräulein von Scuderi&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;Erzählung aus dem Zeitalter Ludwig des Vierzehnten&lt;/em&gt; (1819) are prime examples of the pre-Poe mystery stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;caper&quot;&gt;Caper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caper story is a humorous, adventurous or otherwise clever example of the classic straight crime story. It involves crooks who, through unusual demonstration of creativity, embark on a mission to steal valuable jewels, painting, or other artifact from a highly secured museum or bank vault. The crooks, themselves, are the heroes of the genre, often portrayed as Robin Hood-esque characters fighting against corrupt government or business entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caper is a highly suspenseful story in which the daring crook is pitted against police or merely the security measures in place to prevent the theft. The story may focus only on the planning and execution of the theft, or it may open with the audacious actions of the balaclava-masked intruder lowering himself from the museum ceiling to outwit the security, then follow as the crook must evade capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular examples from novels include Donald E. Westlake's highly comic tales of unusual thefts to Lawrence Block's Bernie Rhodenbarr novels of an honest crook up against a corrupt cop. Ever a popular genre for films, the caper crime story is featured in the &lt;em&gt;Ocean's Eleven&lt;/em&gt; (2001) film and sequels (2004, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can also be called a &lt;em&gt;heist&lt;/em&gt;, but that often entails a more serious treatment, rather than the emphasis on the daring-do and dauntless creativity of the caper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;childwoman-in-peril&quot;&gt;Child/Woman in Peril&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the focus is either a child or woman who is put in harm's way because of a crime commit either by someone they know like a parent, or because of something they, themselves did. The story focuses on their struggle to free themselves from the forces of evil pitted against them. Often told through the personal voice of the victim, the child or woman in peril mystery can be one of the most jarring styles of mystery writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written in 1748, the novel &lt;em&gt;Clarissa, or the History of a Young Lady&lt;/em&gt; by Samuel Richardson is one of the earliest examples but the form became popular in the post-war men's adventure pulp magazines, which often told of women kidnapped by Nazi or Japanese soldiers and forced to spy or do other horrendous acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The child in peril group of mystery stories stems from fairy tales like those of the Brothers Grimm. Modern examples include the &lt;em&gt;Anne of Green Gables&lt;/em&gt; stories (beginning in 1908) by Lucy Maud Montgomery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;womand/child in&lt;/em&gt; jeopardy, damsel &lt;em&gt;in distress&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;kidnapping&lt;/em&gt; mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;comicbumbling-detective&quot;&gt;Comic/Bumbling Detective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're looking for a laugh or just a giggle, the comic or bumbling detective story provides a lighter approach to the mystery. Here, the emphasis is on a detective who, despite his clumsy or inept ways, manages to solve the crime at hand. The classic example that most people will think of is Blake Edward's creation of Inspector Clouseau, of the French Surete, and played in the films by Peter Sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the subgenre of mysteries that require readers to suspend the most disbelief, bumbling detective stories focus on the absurd, both in overall plot and in the usually circuitous route taken to nab the perpetrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides Clouseau, other comic detectives include the journalist-pair of X, featured in Y's short stories like &quot;Z&quot;, featured in A magazine. Others include the Columbo stories starring Peter Falk on television, and &lt;em&gt;The Burglar Who Like to Quote Kipling&lt;/em&gt; (1979) by Lawrence Block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;humorous&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;puzzle&lt;/em&gt; mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;cozy&quot;&gt;Cozy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First appearing in the later part of the twentieth century, the cozy mystery is an homage to the Golden Age British novels of the 1920s and 1930s. Distinct from the Golden Age not just in time period, cozies are narrower in definition than their predecessors. They are distinct in their adherence to keeping violence and sex off the page. Ripe with murder of all ilks, cozy mysteries put an emphasis on the elaborate murder weapons and the aftermath of the killing rather than on demonstrating it. Even when the killer is unmasked, he or she gives up without a fight and frequently gives a soliloquy explanation of why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sleuths of the cozy mystery are typically women, typically amateur. Rather than being some kind of detective, the detectives are everyday folk like teachers, chefs, librarians, and little old ladies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major authors of cozy mystery novels include Lilian Jackson Braun, known for her &lt;em&gt;The Cat Who …&lt;/em&gt; series; Rita Mae Brown (&lt;em&gt;The Foxhunting Mystery Series&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Mags &amp;amp; Baxter Mystery Series&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Mrs. Murphy&lt;/em&gt; series that was &quot;co-authored with her talking cat as the main character.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cozy mysteries may also be called &lt;em&gt;cozies&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;softboiled&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;little old lady mysteries&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;espionage&quot;&gt;Espionage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ever-popular subgenre of crime fiction, the espionage mystery is set on the stage of international politics and international intrigue. Rather than private or police detectives, heroes are spies, counter-spies and other intelligence officers. It is thematically similar to adventure fiction, political thrillers and military thrillers but includes the elements of mystery such as a murdered spy or lost piece of intelligence that the hero must find before the minions of the evil empire can take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G. K. Chesterton gives us an excellent example of the espionage mystery in his 1908 &lt;em&gt;The Man Who Was Thursday&lt;/em&gt;, which tells of the infiltration of an anarchist organization by detectives. Sherlock Holmes also served as a spyhunter in &quot;The Adventures of the Second Stain&quot; (1904).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &quot;spy novel&quot; was coined by Irish author Robert Erskine Childers in his 1903 novel &lt;em&gt;The Riddle of the Sands&lt;/em&gt;, in which amateur spies discover a German plan to invade Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 film &lt;em&gt;The 39 Steps&lt;/em&gt; is another example of the espionage mystery story in which Richard Hannay, a London civilian, is caught up in a crime story of spies attempting to steal British military secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;spy fiction&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;spy thriller&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;espionage thriller&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;spy-fi&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;furry-detectives&quot;&gt;Furry Detectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furry detectives are animals, usually cats although other animals are featured, as the detectives. They may be partners of a private detective and act as more than just pets. One might think of these furry detectives like the witch's familiar providing magical help to the befuddled human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, the animal is communicative with other animals but not with their human counterparts. Often typed as a cozy or softboiled mystery, the furry detective yarn (sorry, cat/yarn…couldn't resist) eschews violence and focuses on the animal's ability to spot clues that the (usually dumber) human counterpart cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples include Lilian Jackson Braun's &quot;Cat Who&quot; series that features a newspaperman and his psychic cat who gives him clues to help solve the mysteries. Fictional private detective Elvis Cole, created by Robert Crais, is a cat owner whose adopted feline is a key character in the stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could be referred to as &lt;em&gt;animal mysteries&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dog&lt;/em&gt; (or any other animal) mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;golden-age&quot;&gt;Golden Age&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Golden Age of mystery fiction refers not to a specific style of story but to a period of history, typically bracketed between 1920 and the early years of World War II, with some examples dating to 1911. It primarily refers to the British school of authors who created puzzle and whodunit style stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The era produced the first codified rules for writing detective fiction, including &lt;em&gt;The Decalogue, or Ten Rules of Detective Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, created by Monsignor Ronald Knox in 1929. It, and other rule sets, emphasized the game aspect of the mystery and instituted the concept of 'fair play', which required the author to provide the reader with every clue that the detective saw in order to give the reader an equal chance to solve the crime before the last-page reveal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golden Age stories are often set on secluded English estates, during heavy storms and at night. Locked room or impossible crime stories were part and parcel of the era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant authors and their works include: Agatha Christie, creator of Hecule Poriot, Miss Marple and other famed literary sleuths (&lt;em&gt;Peril at End House&lt;/em&gt;, …), John Dickson Carr (&lt;em&gt;The Problem of the Wire Cage&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hag's Nook&lt;/em&gt;), G. K. Chesterton (&lt;em&gt;The Innocence of Father Brown&lt;/em&gt;, ), and Dorothy L. Sayers (&lt;em&gt;Gaudy Night&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Nine Tailors&lt;/em&gt; both featuring Lord Peter Wimsey).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;locked room&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;impossible crime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;paradox&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;puzzle&lt;/em&gt;, or (incorrectly) &lt;em&gt;cozy mysteries&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;hardboiled&quot;&gt;Hardboiled&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born of the Prohibition Era (1920 – 1933) in America, the hardboiled detective genre tackled the gritty side of life. A uniquely American style, although copied throughout the world, the hardboiled detective story is typified by the hard-drinking, hard-womanizing, violent, but ultimately positive anti-hero. It takes on an earthy realism with graphic violence and sex playout on against a backdrop of seedy bars, big cities, underworld influences and dangerous dames. It carries with it a sense of disillusionment, heightened by political, social and economic problems of the 1920s Prohibition and 1930s Depression eras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raymond Chandler, author of the hardboiled classic &lt;em&gt;The Big Sleep&lt;/em&gt; (1939), wrote that the 'smell of fear' permiated these stories and reflected the modern condition the hardboiled authors saw and put in the embittered detectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other prime examples of hardboiled fiction include James M. Cain's &lt;em&gt;The Postman Always Rings Twice&lt;/em&gt; (1934) and Mickey Spillane's &lt;em&gt;I, the Jury&lt;/em&gt; (1947).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;hardboiled PI&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;private eye&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;private dick&lt;/em&gt; fiction and often confused with &lt;em&gt;noir&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;heist&quot;&gt;Heist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the caper story, a heist mystery focuses on the crooks and their theft of some valuable property. However, in contrast to the capers humor and emphasis on the creativity of the crime, the heist is a grittier form of the straight crime story. The heist often involves heavy violence, like bank robbers with large caliber weapons. The heist is less elaborately planned than a caper and usually involves brute force to steal the item rather than light-fingered lifting of valuables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heist crime story involves the entire crime, from the planning stages through execution and escape. Stories may emphasize one aspect of the crime over the others. Rather than loveable rogue characters, heist stories attempt to capture the rawness of the career thief and show the rough and dangerous life led by men of violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples include the Parker series by Donald E. Westlake (writing under the pseudonym Richard Stark), including &lt;em&gt;The Hunter&lt;/em&gt; (1981) and &lt;em&gt;The Man with the Getaway Face&lt;/em&gt; (1984).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be called &lt;em&gt;straight crime stories&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;capers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;historicalperiod&quot;&gt;Historical/Period&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical mystery fiction stands out in its choice of setting, any time period prior to the modern age. The emphasis is not on any one particular style of mystery (locked room, private detective) but may include any other the other types of mystery stories. The key is the historical setting. They are, specifically, historical from the author's perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also include stories of modern detectives solving historic crimes, such as Josephine Tey's &lt;em&gt;The Daughter of Time&lt;/em&gt; (1951) in which a modern policeman investigates the fifteenth century case of Richard III of England during an extended hospital stay. Other variations include alternate history or fantasy world mystery stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other prime examples include Ellis Peters &lt;em&gt;Cadfael Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; (1977 – 1994) set in the twelth century England, as well as Umbro Eco's masterpiece &lt;em&gt;In the Name of the Rose&lt;/em&gt; (1980).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called an &lt;em&gt;historical whodunit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;holmesian&quot;&gt;Holmesian&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Holmesian detective story can mean one of two things: either a story written about Sherlock Holmes by authors other than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as with &quot;The Late Sherlock Holmes&quot; by Doyle's friend and creator of Peter Pan J. M. Berry in 1893; or the moniker of a Holmesian detective story can awarded when a story closely follows the hallmarks of a Sherlock Holmes type story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berrie's pastiche is the first known of Doyle's creation but authors have created a significant body of work, expanding on the stories by the creator. Writers from Anthony Burgess, Stephen King, A. A. Milne and Neil Gaiman have all written Holmesian pastiches. Sherlock Holmes holds the record for the most television shows and film characterizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Works similar to Doyle's work follow the conventions such as a strong-minded, deductive-type detective who uses a combination of reasoning and scientific analysis to uncover and make sense of clues. The broader Holmesian style is closely allied with the scientific school of detective fiction. Examples include P. G. Wodehouse's &quot;Death at the Excelsior&quot; (1914) and Samuel Hopkins Adams' &lt;em&gt;The Flying Death&lt;/em&gt; (1903).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;scientific detective fiction&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;intuitionism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;horror&quot;&gt;Horror&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that go bump in the night. Dark moors and creatures we'd rather not encounter even in the daylight. Such are the makings of the horror subgenre within mystery fiction. It has its roots in the Gothic fiction and horror novels like many works of Poe and Mary Shelly's &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; (1818), with their ghosts, goblins, vampires and werewolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more recent times, horror mysteries have evolved to include monsters of a more human sort, the men and women who lurk in the darkness of human depravity to prey upon all sorts of humanity. These monsters, because they are mere humans, are perhaps more terrifying than the mystical monsters like ghosts and vampires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2008 novel &lt;em&gt;The Wolfman&lt;/em&gt; by Nicholas Pekearo is a fine example of the horror mystery, tackling the traditional gothic werewolf monster. Stephen King's &lt;em&gt;Bag of Bones&lt;/em&gt; (1998) is an example deftly weaves elements of the more human horror and classic private eye fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;supernatural&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;gothic&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;gothic horror&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;howdunit&quot;&gt;Howdunit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fun variation of the classic whounit mystery story type is the howdunit. Here, rather than try to figure out who committed the crime, the detective must figure out how the crime was committed. The murder, or less often theft, is committed early and in full view of the reader. There is usually no doubt as to the killer's identity (although some mystery television shows, like &lt;em&gt;Columbo&lt;/em&gt; (1968 – 78, 1989 – 2003)&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; starring Peter Falk, like to hint heavily at the murderer's identity without overtly revealing it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detective either (as in the case of Columbo) quickly sees who the guilty party is through his unusual powers of observation or deduction or the murder is actually show without hiding the killer's identity. The thrill, then, is in the chase. Who will win the battle of wits and intelligence, the intrepid detective or the crafty killer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A favorite genre of television mysteries, the howdunit is also popular in short stories and novels including R. Austin Freeman's works Dr. Thorndyke mysteries (1907 – 1942). Freeman claimed to have invented the howdunit style. Others include Patricia Highsmith's &lt;em&gt;This Sweet Sickness&lt;/em&gt; (1960) and Dorothy's L. Sayer's Lord Wimsey short story &quot;The Abominable History of the Man with Copper Fingers&quot; (1928).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May be referred to as a &lt;em&gt;howcatchem&lt;/em&gt; or simply the &lt;em&gt;inverted detective story&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;impossible-crimes&quot;&gt;Impossible Crimes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A broad category of mystery stories primarily from the Golden Age of mystery fiction, the impossible crimes subgenre is a catchall for any type of mystery where the crime is committed in such a way that it is seemingly impossible. 'Seemingly' being the operative word. Example plots include the classic locked room, where the murder victim is alone in a locked-from-the-inside room when murdered, the no-footprints murder where the body is surrounded by mud or snow but no footprints can be found, and murders committed in front of a mass of witnesses but where the killer was no actually seen committing the crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often tied to the Gothic fiction of the Victorian Age, with its emphasis on ghosts, vampires and other supernatural forces that could come and go as they pleased without regard for locked doors or wet snow, the impossible crime stories presented the reader with the mental challenge of an elaborate puzzle. With few clues, they were forced to intuit the possible solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Dickson Carr was a significant afficiando of the impossible crimes subgenre. He produced a large number of classic stories that included a impossibilities like the vanishing gun in &lt;em&gt;Til Death Do Us Part&lt;/em&gt; (1944). Other impossible crime stories include the &quot;alibi puzzles&quot; like Freeman Wills Crofts &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; Cask (1920) and Christopher Bush's &lt;em&gt;The Case of the Green Felt Hat&lt;/em&gt; (1939).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;puzzle&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;paradox&lt;/em&gt; crime stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;intuitionist&quot;&gt;Intuitionist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intuitionist school of mystery fiction was a reaction to the realist school and featured genius, eccentric detectives who solved crimes by pure thought, using so-called deductive reasoning to sort out the who and why of a crime. Conan Doyle solidified many of the traits of the intuitionist detectives in his creation of the ultimate deductive detective, Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school of intuitionists was greatly influenced by Anna Katherine Green, Fergus Hume and was hugely popular in the Golden Age era of mysteries. It included Agatha Christie, John Dickson Carr, S. S. Van Dine, and A. A. Milne. His introduction to his 1928 novel &lt;em&gt;The Red House Mystery&lt;/em&gt; is called &quot;a virtual manifesto for intuitionist ideas in mystery fiction&quot; by Mike Grost on his excellent site &quot;A Guide to Classic Mystery and Detection&quot; [http://mikegrost.com/classics.htm].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of intuitionist school of mystery fiction stories include &lt;em&gt;The Strangler Fig&lt;/em&gt; (1930) by Dorothy Stockbridge Tillet writing under the pseudonym John Stephen Strange. An early example &lt;em&gt;Ashton-Kirk: Secret Agent&lt;/em&gt; (1912) by John T. McIntyre begins as a Holmesian story but shifts in later chapters to a Golden Age type intuitionist whodunit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called the &lt;em&gt;S. S. Van Dine School&lt;/em&gt; of mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;inverted&quot;&gt;Inverted&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flip of the classic whodunit style of mystery story, the inverted mystery reveals the perp at or very near the beginning of the story. The focus turns then to tracking and capturing the crook. R. Austin Freeman who wrote in his 1912 short story collection &lt;em&gt;The Singing Bone&lt;/em&gt; claimed to have invented the inverted mystery and said he gave the reader all the facts about the criminal and the crime. &quot;But I calculated that the reader would be so occupied with the crime that he would overlook the evidence…The second part, which described the investigation of the crime, had to most readers the effect of new matter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthondy Berkeley Cox, writing as Francis Iles, wrote an early example in &lt;em&gt;Malice Aforethought&lt;/em&gt; (1931). Dorothy L. Sayer's Lord Peter Wimsey enjoys the inverted mystery in &lt;em&gt;Unnatural Death&lt;/em&gt; (1927) and &lt;em&gt;Strong Passion&lt;/em&gt; (1930).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called a &lt;em&gt;reverse whodunit&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;howcatem&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;howdunit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;kidsyoung-adult&quot;&gt;Kids/young adult&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No fan of mystery fiction, no matter his or her age, fails to remember days of their youth spent reading &lt;em&gt;The Hardy Boys&lt;/em&gt; created by Frank and Joe Hardy (first appearing in 1927) or the &lt;em&gt;Nancy Drew&lt;/em&gt; series, created by publisher Edward Stratemeyer (first appearance in 1930) of kid and young adult mysteries. Nor will we forget the hours spent gleefully watching the Scooby-Doo cartoon series (starting 1969) with Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne and Velma unmasking crooks as they tootled around in their Mystery Machine van.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subgenre continues to be one of the most popular areas of mystery fiction and may follow the general genre constraints of any of the other subgenres, from Holmesian to Cozy or Golden Age puzzle and locked room mysteries. This genre includes books that range from young child picture book mysteries like the 2010 &lt;em&gt;What Really Happened to Humpty?: From the Files of a Hard-Boiled Detective&lt;/em&gt; by Jeanie Franz Ransom and illustrated by Stephen Axelsen to the &lt;em&gt;Encylopedia Brown&lt;/em&gt; series of 29 novels by Donald J. Sobol, first published in 1963.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;child mystery fiction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;legal-mystery&quot;&gt;Legal Mystery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all love to hate lawyers and many of us would probably like to see more of them on the wrong end of a mystery or murder plot, but the legal mystery subgenre is one place we enjoy seeing lawyers succeed. Perhaps its because we tend to identify with the hapless victims accused of a crime they didn't commit that these legal eagles try to help. The genre follows the legal proceedings as an often underpaid and overworked attorney seeks to prove his client innocent while forcing the true guilty party to confess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps best known in literature are Earle Stanley Gardner's 82 novels and numerous short stories starring Perry Mason (published from 1933 – 1973, and several posthumously), not to many numerous television and film adaptions. &lt;em&gt;The Spider Lily&lt;/em&gt; (1953) by Bruno Fischer is an example of the legal mystery that takes place both inside and outside the courtroom. Harper Lee's &lt;em&gt;To Kill A Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt; is a classic example of the legal mystery genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;courtroom dramas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;locked-room&quot;&gt;Locked Room&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locked room mystery is a narrower interpretation of the impossible crime subgenre in which the crime is committed and the killer escapes, seemingly from inside a locked room. The circumstances of the murder would indicate some kind of supernatural criminal, capable of entering and leaving a locked room without leaving a trace or breaking a lock. However, there is nearly always, at least in the best examples, a perfectly rational explanation for how the crime was committed. It just takes an eagle-eyed detective and a bit of deductive reasoning to figure out the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although typically a Golden Age favorite, the genre conventions can actually be seen as far back as Old Testament writings, specifically the tale of &quot;Bel and the Dragon&quot; where Daniel debunks the worship of an idol that supposedly eats food offerings left in a sealed room (Book of Daniel 14).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Dickson Carr (also writing as Carter Dickson) is heralded as the premier author of locked room mysteries. His novel &lt;em&gt;The Hollow Man&lt;/em&gt; (1935) was voted the best locked room mystery by a panel of authors and critics. Others include Lawrence Block's &lt;em&gt;Burglars Can't Be Choosers&lt;/em&gt; (1977), Agatha Christie's &lt;em&gt;Murder in Meopotamia&lt;/em&gt; (1936), and S. S. Van Dine's &lt;em&gt;The Canary Murder Case&lt;/em&gt; (1927).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called an &lt;em&gt;impossible crime story&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;medical-mystery&quot;&gt;Medical Mystery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medical mystery subgenre is a particular take on the amateur sleuth subgenre of mystery fiction. The story revolves around the death of a patient under suspicious circumstances. Oftentimes, the investigator is a doctor (hence its inclusion in the amateur detective category), nurse or other medical practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot may center around odd diseases or medical conditions that are not easily diagnosed, and true to the mystery genre as a whole, are usually intentionally caused by some villain. The genre easily morphs into the thriller category, where the unsuspecting doctor is pitted against the faceless drug company who's profit-driven motives cause murder in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the professional sleuth category of medical mystery fiction, the medical examiner as a member of the police force is the central character and is tasked with uncovering hidden poisons or other means of murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Andromeda Strain&lt;/em&gt; by Michael Crighton and any of Robin Cook's novels including &lt;em&gt;Coma&lt;/em&gt; are modern examples but R. Austin Freeman's Dr. John Thorndyke, a medical doctor who was also a forensic specialist fit this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called a &lt;em&gt;medical thriller&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;noir&quot;&gt;Noir&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically lumped in with hardboiled detective fiction, noir stories stand out from their cousin by nature of the protagonist, the guy or gal at the center of the story. Unlike a hardboiled yarn, where a detective chases clues and crooks, the noir focuses on what Otto Penzler, founder of The Mysterious Press and The Mysterious Bookshop, called the loser, characters that are &quot;doomed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protagonist is a hapless victim, but one of his own vices. Finding himself in circumstances beyond his control, framed for murder, on the run, the noir protagonist is an everyday guy or gal who, because of something he saw or something he knows, finds himself beset by danger and desperate to escape. And they do not always, or even often, escape to a happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noir fiction was first seen in French cinema and referred to both the themes of disillusionment and despair of the characters, and the dark, almost chiaroscuroan lighting methods used in the French films. Like the painters of the Renaissance era who used strong contrasts between light and dark, the noir filmmakers used strong hard lighting against deep shadows to cast characters and scenes in ominous tones, emphasizing and playing on the grittiness of the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James M. Cain is regarded as an American pioneer of the noir genre. Others include Cornell Woolrich (&lt;em&gt;Black Alibi&lt;/em&gt;, 1942), Dorothy B. Hughes (&lt;em&gt;The Bamboo Blonde&lt;/em&gt;, 1941), Jim Thompson (&lt;em&gt;Nothing More Than Murder&lt;/em&gt;, 1949), and Elmore Leonard (&lt;em&gt;The Bounty Hunters&lt;/em&gt;, 1953).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also known as &lt;em&gt;roman noir&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;urban noir&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;neo-noir&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;nihilistic crime fiction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;police-detective&quot;&gt;Police Detective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A police detective mystery story is a specific type of professional detective story, featuring a detective in the employ of the city or state. It can also include federal agencies and even espionage genres if the focus of the story is on the exploits of the cop as he uses whatever tools are at his disposal to solve the crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is often closely tied to the police procedural but doesn't necessarily involve a group of detectives. It can feature a single cop or a pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short story published in September 1837 by William Evans Burton called &quot;The Secret Cell&quot; tells of a London policeman solving the kidnapping of a young girl, and is an early example of a policeman relying on undercover work, evidence collecting and other legwork rather than deductive reasoning to solve a murder. Other examples include Emile Gaboriou's &lt;em&gt;Monsier Lecoq&lt;/em&gt; (1868) depicting a young policeman's efforts to solve the riddle of two men's deaths in a bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also referred to as &lt;em&gt;Police Procedural&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Professional Detective&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;police-procedural&quot;&gt;Police Procedural&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This popular subgenre of mystery fiction seeks to accurately depict the crime solving processes of a police department. It may follow a single squad or an entire cadre of beat cops, detectives and forensics scientists. The details of how the police go about collecting evidence and tracking a killer or other criminal are vital aspects of the plot, almost ursurping the characters themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genre dates back to Wilke Collins novel &lt;em&gt;The Moonstone&lt;/em&gt;  (1868), which follows a Scotland Yard detective as he collects evidence in the theft of a valuable diamond. However, it has its roots in the scientific detective school dating to Conan Doyle's Holmes. It became prominent after World War II as the entire genre of mystery fiction turned away from the PI towards the newly respected police forces. As science enabled better forensics, the public fascination with the techniques and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;V as in Victim&lt;/em&gt;  (1945) by Lawrence Treat is general given as the first true police procedural novel. Also popular in film and television, the genre is represented by films &lt;em&gt;The Naked City&lt;/em&gt; (1948) and &lt;em&gt;The Street With No Name&lt;/em&gt; (1948), as well as popular radio and television shows like &lt;em&gt;Dragnet&lt;/em&gt; (radio starting in 1949, transitioning to television in 1951).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;police crime drama&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;crime drama&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;professional-detective&quot;&gt;Professional Detective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The professional detective is a crime investigator whose job centers around unearthing clues and solving crime. It can refer to private detectives who are hired to chase wandering husbands or find kidnap victims or police detectives who solve crimes as their day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some definitions may include any professional, from doctors to lawyers, who, in the course of their day jobs, stumble across murders and other crimes and pursue the mystery. However, these characters fail the test because while they may investigate crimes, it is not their primary job and therefore their investigative efforts are firmly in the amateur category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;em&gt;Hardboiled&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Noir&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Police Detective&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Police Procedural&lt;/em&gt; for specific examples of professional detective stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;romantic&quot;&gt;Romantic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gothic novels, particularly the Victorian era Gothics evolved into two types of modern fiction: the horror story and the romance. In the romance category, lies the further subgenre of the romantic mystery in which love and mystery are hopelessly intertwined. Following in the gothic tradition, the romantic mystery follows a beautiful young, if naïve, girl who investigates some oddity like an unearthly scream, dead body or other mystery. Soon she finds herself in danger (see Child/Woman in Peril) but is soon rescued by the dashing hero; love ensues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the women's lib movement, the damsels in distress became more self-reliant but the elements of romance continued to live on, with themes of betrayal and jealousy as motives for murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short story &quot;Scorpion on the Moon&quot; by M. I. H. Rogers, and first published in Street &amp;amp; Smith's Detective Story Magazine in May 1938, is an example of murder and love as flip sides of the same dangerous coin. Phylis Whitney wrote several modern gothic romance mysteries including &lt;em&gt;The Mystery of the Haunted Pool&lt;/em&gt; (1960) and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;gothic romance&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Victorian gothic&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;love stories&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;scientific&quot;&gt;Scientific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific detective story, generally accepted as having been invented by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in his chemist character Sherlock Holmes, puts a great emphasis on the hard sciences like chemistry and biology, as well as pseudo-sciences like phrenology to uncover and decipher clues. The style gained ground during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as science itself became more important to daily life and new theories of evolution, astronomy, the biological sciences and chemistry abounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it was not until authors like L. T. Meade and Halifax's &lt;em&gt;Stories from the Diary of a Doctor&lt;/em&gt; (1894) that individual stories focused on using the scientific method applied to solving murder and other crimes. R. Austin Freeman's character Dr. Thorndyke followed in an outstanding body of work, including more than 60 novels and short stories from 1907 to 1942. Freeman, himself, is said to have conducted the actual experiments that his character Dr. Thorndyke performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other significant stories include Mary Roberts Rinehart's Miss Pinkerton stories (1904), and the works of Nigel Morland, Helen Reilly, and Hugo Gernsback, editor of pulp science fiction magazine &lt;em&gt;Amazing Stories&lt;/em&gt; (beginning publication in 1926), wrote numerous scientific detective stories. These and others are discuss in the article &quot;Scientific Detection&quot; by historian Sam Muskowitz and in &lt;em&gt;The Encylopedia of Mystery and Detection&lt;/em&gt; (1976), edited by Otto Prenzler and Chris Steinbrunner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;suspense&quot;&gt;Suspense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the suspense type mystery story is more a method of telling the story and is present in some form in most types of mystery fiction, many stories rely heavily on the elements of suspense to carry the story. It is similar to the thriller genre of mystery fiction but typically takes a slower pace, allowing the tension to build as events plod along like a slow drip faucet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common in inverted or howdunit mysteries, suspense detective stories deemphasize the journey to uncover and make sense of clues and focus instead on raising the stakes for the detective or other protagonist as he pursues the criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often featured in stories about larger villains than the average jealous husband or genteel Golden Age murderer, the suspense story may reveal the villain early but leave the reader guessing as to whether the detective can outwit her foe or be doomed to become another victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suspense is part and parcel to most mysteries but specifically suspense-driven mystery stories include Francis Iles (penname of Anthony Berkeley) who wrote &lt;em&gt;Before the Fact&lt;/em&gt; (1932) and Steig Larrson's trilogy starting with &lt;em&gt;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&lt;/em&gt; (2008).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also referred to as &lt;em&gt;thriller&lt;/em&gt; mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;thriller&quot;&gt;Thriller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically a twin of the suspense genre of mystery and detective fiction, the thriller differentiates itself from the suspense or other mystery style of writing with its frantic pace and high stakes. It is often a race against time to stop a serial killer from plying his trade again or on a larger scale, poisoning a city's water supply. Many noir and hardboiled style mysteries employ the elements of a thriller, keeping the reader off balance by the quick and hard hitting action of the detective or dupe in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The points of the plot build and continue to add tension until the blow-out climax when the grit and determination of the sleuth are tested against an overwhelming foe. It is a villain-driven plot and therefore typically falls in the inverted genre of mystery story. And rather than racing to find the killer, the sleuth is usually tasked with escaping a trap before his own death or otherwise stopping a pending villain-induced disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 39 Steps&lt;/em&gt; (1915) by John Buchan is regarded as the earliest example of the thriller mystery. Other fine examples include films like many of Alfred Hichcock's films, especially &lt;em&gt;Dial M for Murder&lt;/em&gt; (1954) and &lt;em&gt;The Riddle of the Sands&lt;/em&gt; (1903) by Erskine Childers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called &lt;em&gt;suspense&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;horror&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;or end-of-your-seat&lt;/em&gt; mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;true-crime&quot;&gt;True Crime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While technically a nonfiction genre, true crime stories are nonetheless part of the canon of mystery subgenres. It examines, as the title would indicate, actual crimes and seeks to tell, in as honest a way, the story of that crime. Typically, the crimes are sensational murders or sprees. Also popular are biographies of well-known serial killers like Ted Bundy. The genre was also popular in the later years of the pulp detective magazine, with stories told of men like Bluebeard, who murdered his wives, to stories of gangland hits. They may or may not have been true stories but were littered with photographs that seemed to authenticate the realism presented in the pulp true crime magazines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the most well-known examples of true crime are &lt;em&gt;Helter Skelter&lt;/em&gt; (1974), the true story of the Manson family murders written by Vincent Bugliosi; and &lt;em&gt;In Cold Blood&lt;/em&gt; (1966) detailing the brutal, execution-style 1959 murder of the Herbert Clutter Kansas family by two ex-cons and their subsequent arrest, trial and execution by hanging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often called a &lt;em&gt;nonfiction novel&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;whodunit&quot;&gt;Whodunit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whodunit is the classic mystery or crime story, usually involving a murder, a sleuth of some variety and a hodgepodge of clues that lead the detective and the reader down blind alleys reeking of red herrings to the last-page reveal of the dastardly killer. It is a complex, plot-driven example of the detective yarn that gives readers an equal opportunity to scrutinize the evidence and solve the crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protagonist is often an eccentric amateur or semi-professional detective who is somehow connected with either the victim or the suspect, but not the final killer. The term was coined in the mid-1930s and first appeared in the pages of &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genre flourished during the Golden Age of British mystery fiction, with its puzzle and locked room cases of murder and serialized and often dotty detectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilke Collin's &lt;em&gt;The Moonstone&lt;/em&gt; (1868) is generally regarded as the first true whodunit. Others include Gaston Leroux's &lt;em&gt;The Mystery of the Yellow Room&lt;/em&gt; (1907), A. A. Milne's &lt;em&gt;The Red House Mystery&lt;/em&gt; (1922), John Dickson Carr's &lt;em&gt;The Hollow Man&lt;/em&gt; (1935), and Rex Stout's &lt;em&gt;The League of Frightened Men&lt;/em&gt; (1935).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called a &lt;em&gt;whodunnit&lt;/em&gt; (two 'n's'), &lt;em&gt;who done it&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;who did it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even a remotely exhaustive list of potential categories, breakdowns or tags with which to identify and classify a mystery, but a good start. Remember when looking at your mystery, whether one you're reading or one you're writing, that it may not fit cleanly in a single classification. Make a mental list of the various characters, settings, scenes and then decide what subgenre best describes your story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The all-important character of the Detective Story is, of course, the Detective. He is not only the Star Performer, but the reason for the Detective Story itself. What Mr. Hawthorne calls the Transcendent Detective is the detective of fiction. Such a one is made, not born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Vance Thompson puts it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Readers who pant breathlessly after Sherlock Holmes and his like should give thanks to Edgar Allan Poe; when he invented Dupin in the 'Murders in the Rue Morgue,' he created once for all the type of the detective in fiction. In all the years it has not changed very much. Sherlock Holmes still sits in his dark, superheated chamber; he is drugged with tobacco and opium; he maintains the 'profound silence' that distinguished Poe's cold analyst; indeed, one may be sure that the type will live for another eighty years.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-real-detective-and-his-work&quot;&gt;The Real Detective and His Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we have already agreed that this fiction detective has little or nothing to do with the real detective. When M. Goron, one of the greatest of French detectives, was asked concerning this, he replied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I dare say I have read nearly all the detective stories, those of Poe and Gaboriau, and 'Sir Doyle's' clever tales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Like everyone else I love to follow the twists and turns that lead to the end of these apparently inexplicable problems. It is a good intellectual sport—like playing chess. But do not imagine for a moment,&quot; and M. Goron was emphatic, &quot;that it has anything at all to do with practical police work. Nothing at all. It is not by such subtle, opium-bred guesswork and fine-drawn deduction that criminals are detected.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M. Goron's theory is that in thief-taking, as in everything else, system is of prime importance; and after that the most effective auxiliary of the detective is Chance. Almost always it is by a lucky hazard that the shrewd criminal is brought down. For instance, the taking of Magne; it was tragically absurd—for the farce ended in the basket of wet sawdust under the guillotine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, detectives of real life invariably scorn the transcendent detective of fiction, and, in his turn, the story-book detective scoffs at the methods of the Central Office men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Arthur C. Train, in &quot;Courts Criminal and The Camorra,&quot; thus mildly satirizes our detective of fiction and sets him quite apart from the genuine article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The sanctified tradition that a detective was an agile person with a variety of side whiskers no longer obtains even in light literature, and the most imaginative of us is frankly aware of the fact that a detective is just a common man earning (or pretending to earn) a common living by common and obvious means. Yet in spite of ourselves we are accustomed to attribute superhuman acuteness and a lightning-like rapidity of intellect to this vague and romantic class of fellow-citizens. The ordinary work of a detective, however, requires neither of these qualities. Honesty and obedience are his chief requirements, and if he have intelligence as well, so much the better, provided it be of the variety known as horse sense. A genuine candidate for the job of Sherlock Holmes would find little competition. In the first place, the usual work of a detective does not demand any extraordinary powers of deduction at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There are a very large number of persons who go into the detective business for the same reason that others enter the ministry—they can't make a living at anything else. Provided he has squint eyes and a dark complexion, almost anybody feels that he is qualified to unravel the tangled threads of crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The real detective is the one who, taking up the solution of a crime or other mystery, brings to bear upon it unusual powers of observation and deduction and an exceptional resourcefulness in acting upon his conclusions. Frankly, I have known very few such, although for some ten years I have made use of a large number of so-called detectives in both public and private matters. As I recall the long line of cases were these men have rendered service of great value, almost every one resolves itself into a successful piece of mere spying or trailing. Little ingenuity or powers of reason were required. Of course, there are a thousand tricks that an experienced man acquires as a matter of course, but which at first sight seem almost like inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There is no more reason to look for superiority of intelligence or mental alertness among detectives of the ordinary class than there is to expect it from clerks, stationary engineers, plumbers, or firemen. While comparisons are invidious, I should be inclined to say that the ordinary chauffeur was probably a brighter man than the average detective. This is not to be taken in derogation of the latter, but as a compliment to the former. There is more reason why he should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The telephone is the modern detective's chief ally, and he relies upon rapidity more than upon deduction. Under present conditions it is easier to overtake a crook than to reason out what he will probably do. In fact, the old-fashioned 'deductive detective1 is largely a man of the past. The most useless operator in the world is the one who is 'wedded to his own theory' of the case—the man who asks no questions and relies only on himself. Interject a new element into a case and such a man is all at sea. In the meantime the criminal has made his 'get away.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In the story-books your detective scans with eagle eye the surface of the floor for microscopic evidences of crime. His mind leaps from a cigar ash to a piece of banana peel and thence to what the family had for dinner. His brain is working all the time. His gray matter dwarfs almost to insignificance that of Daniel Webster or the Hon. Benjamin F. Butler. It is, of course, all quite wonderful and most excellent reading, and the old-style sleuth really thought he could do it! Nowadays, while the fake detective is snooping around the back piazza with a telescope, the real one is getting the 'dope' from the village blacksmith or barber (if there is any except on Saturday nights) or the girl that slings the pie at the station. These folk have something to go on. They may not be highly intelligent, but they know the country, and, what is more important, they know the people. All the brains in the world cannot make up for the lack of an elementary knowledge of the place and the characters themselves. It stands to reason that no strange detective could form as good an opinion as to which of the members of your household would be most likely to steal a piece of jewelry as you could yourself. Yet the old-fashioned Sherlock knew and knows it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There is no mystery about such work, except what the detective himself sees fit to enshroud it with. Most of us do detective work all the time without being conscious of it. Simply because the matter concerns the theft of a pearl, or the betraying of a business or professional secret, or the disappearance of a friend, the opinion of a stranger becomes no more valuable. And the chances are equal that the stranger will make a bungle of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The national detective agency with its thousands of employees who have, most of them, grown up and received their training in its service, is a powerful organization, highly centralized, and having an immense sinking fund of special knowledge and past experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This is the product of decades of patient labor and minute record. The agency which offers you the services of a Sherlock Holmes is a fraud, but you can accept as genuine a proposition to run down any man whose picture you may be able to identify in the gallery. The day of the impersonator is over. The detective of this generation is a hard-headed business man with a stout pair of legs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the reader will observe that there are just a few more real detectives still left in the business—if you can find them. Incidentally, they one and all take off their hats to Scotland Yard. They will tell you that the Englishman may be slow (fancy an American Inspector of Police wearing gray suede gloves and brewing himself a dish of tea in his office at four o'clock!), but that once he goes after a crook he is bound to get him—it is merely a question of time. I may add that in the opinion of the heads of the big agencies the percentage of ability in the New York Detective Bureau is high—one of them going so far as to claim that fifty percent of the men have real detective ability—that is to say &quot;brains.&quot; That is rather a higher average than one finds among clergymen and lawyers, yet it may be so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. John Wilson Murray, one of the noted detectives, says simply in his &quot;Memoirs of a Great Detective&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There is no magic about the detective business. A detective walking along the street does not suddenly hear a mysterious voice whisper 'Banker John Jones has just been robbed of $1,000,000.' He does not turn the corner and come upon a perfect stranger, and then, because the stranger has a twisted cigar in his mouth, suddenly pounce upon him and exclaim: 'Aha, villain that you are! give back to Banker Jones the $1,000,000 you stole ten minutes ago!1 The detective business is of no such foolish and impossible character. Detectives are not clairvoyants, or infallible prophets, or supernatural seers. They possess no uncanny powers and no mantle of mysterious wonder-working. I remember a few years ago I was subpoenaed before a grand jury in the City of New York to testify on a matter pertaining to a prisoner, whose record I knew here in Canada. The foreman of that jury was a man prominent in New York's business life. When I was called he looked at me and suddenly said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'Inspector Murray, what crimes have been committed within the past hour in New York, and who committed them?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'I have not the slightest idea,' I replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'Oh, ho! So you cannot go out and put your hands on every man who has committed a crime? You are a detective, yet cannot do that?' he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'I am not that kind of detective,' I replied. 'When I get a guilty man it usually is by hard work or good luck, and often by both.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'Thank the Lord we've found a detective who is not greater than God,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;As a matter of fact the detective business is a plain ordinary business, just like a lawyer's business, a doctor's business, a railway manager's business. It has its own peculiarities because it deals with crime, with the distorted, imperfect, diseased members of the social body, just as a surgeon's business deals with the distorted, imperfect, diseased members of the physical body. But it is not an abnormal or phenomenal or incomprehensible business. There is nothing done in it, nothing accomplished by any detective, that is not the result of conscientious work, the exercise of human intelligence, an efficient system of organization and intercommunication, and good luck. A good detective must be quick to think, keen to analyse, persistent, resourceful, courageous. But the best detective in the world is a human being, neither half-devil nor half-god, but just a man with the attributes or associates that make him successful in his occupation. &quot;The best detective, therefore, is a man who instinctively detects the truth, lost though it may be in a maze of lies. By instinct he is a detective. He is born to it; his business is his natural bent. It would be a platitude to say the best detectives are born, not made. They are both born and made for the business. The man who, by temperament and make-up, is an ideal detective, must go through the hard years of steady work, must apply himself, and study and toil in making himself what he is born to he. Sandow was born to be a strong man, but, if he had not developed himself by hard work, he would not have become the strongest man of his time. As a detective advances in his business he will find that the more he studies and works, the stronger his powers of intuition, of divination, of analysis become. A very simple broad illustration will prove this. If a detective is chasing a criminal from country to country, and has learned, by study of the extradition treaties, that a certain country offers a better haven than another, he may save himself many a weary mile by going to the country where his common sense tells him his man is more likely to be. A mechanical knowledge of the use of tools, a knowledge of the effects of poisons, a knowledge of the ways of banking, of the habits of life of the various classes, in various callings, a knowledge of crooks, and, above all, a knowledge of human nature, in whatsoever way manifest, are invaluable elements of the equipment of a good detective.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;fictive-detective-material&quot;&gt;Fictive Detective Material&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual work, then, of a real detective does not demand the extraordinary powers of the fiction detective. But the plots selected by fiction writers for their stories are the cases that do demand it. And this, because it interests the reader's imagination, piques his curiosity and makes possible the solution of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assertion of Sherlock Holmes founded on the aphorism that truth is stranger than fiction is in itself fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;My dear fellow,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes, as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man can invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction, with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions, most stale and unprofitable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;And yet I am not convinced of it,&quot; I answered. &quot;The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,&quot; remarked Holmes. &quot;This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first-quoted remarks of Holmes are pure fiction and are introduced by the author to give an effect which he desires. But it is the truth that a certain selection and discretion must be used regarding plots, and it is this that makes or mars the interest of the Detective Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe's three masterpieces of detective fiction are perfectly conceived, constructed and completed, entirely in his imagination. But when he undertook &quot;The Mystery of Marie Roget&quot; he worked upon a plot founded on fact; the story of a real murder of a real girl, with the result that there was no denouement, and the editors of the magazine in which the story originally appeared, decided that it would be best to omit the latter half of the tale, and we are told that it was never printed in full. Though interesting in its statement of the problem, the solution never could be reached, and the story, as a Detective Story, was a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-transcendent-detective&quot;&gt;The Transcendent Detective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The status of the fiction detective is so well-defined that it is the habit of authors to scoff at it, and endeavor to convince us that their own detectives are true to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in a Detective Story of some merit, called &quot;The House Opposite,&quot; by Elizabeth Kent, the detective says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I am aware that the detective of fiction is always supposed to be omniscient, but my profession. Doctor, is just like any other. There is no hocus-pocus about it. To succeed in it requires, in the first place, accurate and most minute powers of observation, unlimited patience, the capacity of putting two and two together. Add to this an unprejudiced mind, and last, but not least, respect, amounting to reverence, for any established fact.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many authors of late think it argues themselves original to indulge in a fleer at the methods of Sherlock Holmes. A typical example of this often-used device is here quoted from &quot;Midnight at Mears House,&quot; by Harrison J. Holt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I smoked, my gaze travelled idly about the room till it rested upon the big brass candlestick smeared with melted tallow which we had found that morning on the dining table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If I were only another Sherlock Holmes now,&quot; I thought,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I should be able to reconstruct the entire tragedy from that candlestick, supposing of course the murderer used it. An intelligent smell of the wick would tell me what particular brand of matches he used to light it, and it would only be necessary to visit the one dealer who kept them and get from him a photograph of the man, or a sufficiently accurate description of him, to make his arrest a matter of only a trifling difficulty.&quot; I chuckled at the absurdity of the notion. It seemed however, hardly more far-fetched and ridiculous than some of the great detective's marvellous exploits, which millions of readers have found plausible enough, I daresay, though I was never one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yielding to a sudden whim, I took down the candlestick from the mantelpiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I should at least be able to deduce a few simple facts from a really scientific examination of it,11 I argued, facetiously—&quot;whether the criminal was right or left- handed, for instance, or wore ready-made clothes, or if he was suffering from rheumatism or the whooping cough. It must be all here somewhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I proceeded gravely to smell of the wick. It had a decidedly burnt odour, due very likely, I imagined, to its having been lighted. It humiliated me, however, to be unable to decide how it had been lighted. I could not for the life of me make out whether the murderer had used wax vesta, safety-matches, ordinary parlour matches, or those infernal things tipped with sulphur commonly known as &quot;hell-sticks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He might even have lighted it with one of those self- igniting platinum-wire and alcohol devices, or with flint and steel, or by rubbing two sticks together, for all I could tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I began to feel discouraged. Doubtless there were imprints of his fingers as thick as flies and as plain as billboards all over the candlestick itself, if I could only find them. He would at any rate have left the damning mark of his thumb somewhere upon its shining surface: they were always considerate enough to do that—in the detective stories. It was part of the game. But again I was doomed to disappointment. We must have blurred the impressions through our inconceivable stupidity in touching the thing at all. We should have known enough,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I reflected, to have left it alone till we had a chance to study it through a high-powered telescope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is good-natured satire, and the very fact that it contains the kernel of truth makes it effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;pioneer-detectives-of-fiction&quot;&gt;Pioneer Detectives of Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though lacking the title, the Transcendent Detective doubtless makes his earliest appearance in the person of M. Dupin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first allusion to Dupin's peculiar talents is found in &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;At such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from his rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic ability in Dupin. He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its exercise—if not exactly in its display—and did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived. He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms, and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own. His manners at these moments were frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation. Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double Dupin—the creative and the resolvent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Let it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am detailing any mystery, or penning any romance. What I have described in the Frenchman was merely the result of an excited, or perhaps of a diseased, intelligence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe deliberately remarks on Dupin's diseased intelligence, thus providing a defence against any implication that the detective's powers were superhuman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analogous to this is Conan Doyle's characterization of Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote from &quot;A Study in Scarlet,&quot; where Holmes makes his first appearance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I'm a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have lots of government detectives and lots of private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger-ends, it is odd if you can't unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade is a well known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;And these other people?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;They are mostly sent out by private inquiry agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They are all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;But do you mean to say,&quot; I said, &quot;that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for themselves?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes. You see, I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the later detective thus scorns the earlier one when Watson, thinking to flatter, compares Holmes to Dupin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,&quot; he observed. &quot;Now, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking in on his friends' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour's silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Have you read Gaboriau's works?&quot; I asked. &quot;Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Lecoq was a miserable bungler/1 he said, in an angry voice; &quot;he had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Dupin himself speaks with equal contempt of his predecessor in the profession. He says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Vidocq, for example, was a good guesser, and a persevering man. But without educated thought, he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations. He impaired his vision by holding the object too close. He might see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual clearness, but in so doing he necessarily lost sight of the matter as a whole.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as Conan Doyle himself declares:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In a work which consists in the drawing of detectives,&quot; he once wrote, &quot;there are only one or two qualities which one can use, and an author is forced to hark back upon them constantly, so that every detective must really resemble every other detective to a greater or less extent. There is no great originality required in devising or constructing such a man, and the only possible originality which one can get into a story about a detective is in giving him original plots and problems to solve, as in his equipment there must be an alert acuteness of mind to grasp facts and the relation which each of them bears to the other.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detectives who follow in the straight path trodden by these pioneers are legion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the best known is The Thinking Machine, hero of two series of stories by the late Jacques Futrelle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thinking Machine whose name was Professor Van Dusen was remotely German. For generations his ancestors had been noted in the sciences; he was the logical result of the master mind. First and above all he was a logician. At least thirty-five years of the half-century or so of his existence had been devoted exclusively to proving that two and two always equal four, except in unusual cases, where they equal three or five, as the case may be. He stood broadly on the general proposition that all things that start must go somewhere, and was able to bring the concentrated mental force of his forefathers to bear on a given problem. Incidentally it may be remarked that Professor Van Dusen wore a No. 8 hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;recent-detectives-of-fiction&quot;&gt;Recent Detectives of Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the best of lately-written detective stories are two by Gaston Leroux, &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room&quot; and &quot;The Perfume of the Lady in Black.&quot; In these stories two detectives figure. Though they are professional and amateur, they are not opposed, as is so often deemed necessary for dramatic effect, but have a far subtler contrast. Rouletabille is a delightful character and satisfactory in his procedure, while Larsan is a genius. And yet these detectives are little known to the reading public. It is perhaps because Sherlock Holmes was first in the modern field, and perhaps partly because his name appears in the titles of the collections of stories about him, that his name is so well known. Mr. Cecil Chesterton is right in saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is at least entitled to claim the honour of being the only novelist since Dickens, one of whose creations has become a popular proverb. It is easy to test this. Mr. Rudyard Kipling is generally considered a popular writer. Mulvaney is probably Mr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kipling's most popular creation. But let anyone say in an assembly of twenty average men chosen at random from the street—'That man is quite a Mulvaney.' Perhaps two men will understand the reference; perhaps one; quite possibly none. But let him say 'That man is quite a Sherlock Holmes.1 The recognition will be instantaneous and unanimous. A man who had not heard of Holmes would be more singular than a man who could not sign his own name. Sir Arthur is the only writer of our time who has done this, and he has never done it twice. He has done more ambitious work than the Sherlock Holmes tales, but none of it has passed into the language.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many series of really good detective stories have been published in magazines, and later in book form, but not one reader in ten remembers the detective's name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luther Trant and Craig Kennedy, Ledroit Conners and Eugene Valmont, are all first class fiction detectives yet their names are not household words like Sherlock Holmes. So with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Man in the Corner, Average Jones, Ashton-Kirk and Paul Beck. So with Scientific Sprague and Astro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though each of these is a real deductive detective, each has his own personal bent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprague, Trant and Kennedy are scientific,—sometimes so much so that they run great danger of losing the popular interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Sprague's manner as the author, Francis Lynde, shows us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;When my attention was first called to such things—it was on a case in the Department of Justice in which I was required to give expert testimony—I was very strongly impressed with the crudities of the ordinary detective methods. I said to myself that what was needed was some one who could apply good, careful laboratory practice; a habit of observation which counts nothing too small to be weighed and measured.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Go on,&quot; said Maxwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The idea came to me that I'd like to try it on, and I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My theory is correct. Human beings react under certain given conditions just as readily, and just as inevitably, as the inorganic substances react in a laboratory experiment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm not sure that I can explain it so that you will understand, but I'll try. In the first place, it is necessary to go at these little problems with a perfectly open mind—the laboratory mind, which is neither prejudiced nor prepossessed nor in any way concerned with anything but the bare facts. Reason, and the proper emphasis to be placed upon each fact as it comes to bat, are the two needful qualities in any problem solving—and about the only two.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I can no more tell you, Dick, than I can explain why, to a majority of people, white is white and black is black. For my own satisfaction I define the 'how' as a natural growth, favored by habit and training, of the scientific attitude; the mental slant which, if given free play, almost unconsciously notes, marks, deduces, reasons; deeming nothing too small or too trifling to go toward making up the whole of any conclusion. More than that, in my own case the faculty is able to hold itself workably aloof from the ordinary distractions of conversation and the like. It goes on, using the outward senses when it needs them, to be sure, but only as aids to the developing of its own little film in its own little dark room. Do you get the idea?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-scientific-detective-of-fiction&quot;&gt;The Scientific Detective of Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all legitimate, but tinged rather deeply with science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craig Kennedy (created by Arthur B. Reeve) says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It has always seemed strange to me that no one has ever endowed a professorship in criminal science in any of our large universities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Craig Kennedy laid down his evening paper and filled his pipe with my tobacco. In college we had roomed together, had shared everything, even poverty, and now that Craig was a professor of chemistry and I was on the staff of the Star, we had continued the arrangement. Prosperity found us in a rather neat bachelor apartment on the Heights, not far from the University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Why should there be a chair in criminal science?&quot; I remarked argumentatively, settling back in my chair. &quot;I've done my turn at police headquarters reporting, and I can tell you, Craig, it's no place for a college professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Crime is just crime. And as for dealing with it, the good detective is born and bred to it. College professors for the sociology of the thing, yes; for the detection of it give me a Byrnes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;On the contrary,&quot; replied Kennedy, his cleancut features betraying an earnestness which I knew indicated that he was leading up to something important, &quot;there is a distinct place for science in the detection of crime. &quot;Colleges have gone a long way from the old ideal of pure culture. They have got down to solving the hard facts of life—pretty nearly an except one. They still treat crime in the old way, study its statistics and pore over its causes and the theories of how it can be prevented. But as for running the criminal himself down, scientifically, relentlessly—bah! we haven't made an inch of progress since the hammer and tongs method of your Byrnes.&quot; &quot;Doubtless you will write a thesis on this most interesting subject,&quot; I suggested, &quot;and let it go at that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No, I am serious,&quot; he replied, determined for some reason or other to make a convert of me. &quot;I mean exactly what I say. I am going to apply science to the detection of crime, the same sort of methods by which you trace out the presence of a chemical, or run an unknown germ to earth. And before I have gone far, I am going to enlist Walter Jameson as an aide. I think I shall need you in my business.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;How do I come in?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, for one thing, you will get a scoop, a beat,—whatever you call it in that newspaper jargon of yours.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Kennedy's methods and descriptions, though interesting to scientific minds, are often above the heads of a popular audience. For instance such a paragraph as this,—and in his stories they abound:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This twelfth series is interesting. So far only radium, thorium, and uranium are generally known. We know that the radio-active elements are constantly breaking down, and one often hears uranium, for instance, called the 'parent' of radium. Radium also gives off an emanation, and among its products is helium, quite another element. Thus the transmutation of matter is, within certain bounds, well known to-day to all scientists like yourself, Professor Kennedy. It has even been rumored but never proved that copper has been transformed into lithium—both members of the hydrogen-gold group, you will observe. Copper to lithium is going backward, so to speak. It has remained for me to devise this protodyne apparatus by which I can reverse that process of decay and go forward in the table,—can change lithium into copper and copper into gold. I can create and destroy matter by protodyne.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-new-psychology-in-detective-stories&quot;&gt;The New Psychology in Detective Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the stories of Craig Kennedy published under the title of &quot;The Silent Bullet&quot; are based upon the various chapters of Professor Hugo Miinsterberg's delightful book called &quot;On The Witness Stand.&quot; It is hoped and believed by Professor Miinster- berg that these psychological experiments will yet become a practical means of the conviction of criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have not as yet obtained official sanction, but as Professor Miinsterberg writes in a personal letter,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I myself did not expect such changes to come very soon, as on the one side there is still too much difference of opinion and of interpretation among the psychologists, and on the other side the whole problem of the experts before court is still in too confused a condition. An amateurish introduction of fancy experiments by lawyers who are dilettantists in psychology would certainly bring more confusion than help. All that has been gained is that evidently the lawyers and judges have become more conscious of the responsibilities which are involved wherever psychical functions are in play. I also think that the use of the brutal methods of extorting confessions and so on has been diminished.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of stories called &quot;The Achievements of Luther Trant,&quot; by Edwin Balmer and William MacHarg, details the experiments of a detective who follows even more closely the experiments described in Professor Miinsterberg's book. The Foreword of this series tells its own story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Except for its characters and plot, this book is not a work of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The methods which the fictitious Trant—one-time assistant in a psychological laboratory, now turned detective—here uses to solve the mysteries which present themselves to him, are real methods; the tests he employs are real tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Though little known to the general public, they are precisely such as are being used daily in the psychological laboratories of the great universities—both in America and Europe—by means of which modern men of science are at last disclosing and defining the workings of that oldest of world mysteries—the human mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The facts which Trant uses are in no way debatable facts; nor do they rest on evidence of untrained, imaginative observers. Innumerable experiments in our university laboratories have established beyond question that, for instance, the resistance of the human body to a weak electric current varies when the subject is frightened or undergoes emotion; and the consequent variation in the strength of the current depending directly upon the amount of emotional disturbance, can be registered by the galvanometer for all to see. The hand resting upon an automatograph will travel toward an object which excites emotion, however capable its possessor may be of restraining all other evidence of what he feels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If these facts are not used as yet except in the academic experiments of the psychological laboratories and the very real and useful purpose to which they have been put in the diagnosis of insanities, it is not because they are incapable of wider use. The results of the 'new psychology1 are coming every day closer to an exact interpretation. The hour is close at hand when they will be used not merely in the determination of guilt and innocence, but to establish in the courts the credibility of witnesses and the impartiality of jurors, and by employers to ascertain the fitness and particular abilities of their employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Luther Trant, therefore, nowhere in this book needs to invent or devise an experiment or an instrument for any of the results he here attains; he has merely to adopt a part of the tried and accepted experiments of modern, scientific psychology. He himself is a character of fiction; but his methods are matters of fact.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar method is hinted at in &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot; stories. Mr. Futrelle says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Finally, with my hand on her pulse—which was normal—I told her as brutally as I could that her husband had been murdered. Her pulse jumped frightfully and as I told her the cause of death it wavered, weakened and she fainted. Now if she had known her husband were dead—even if she had killed him—a mere statement of his death would not have caused that pulse.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;other-types&quot;&gt;Other Types&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Man In The Corner,&quot; by Baroness Orczy, introduces himself in this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The man in the corner pushed aside his glass, and leant across the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Mysteries!&quot; he commented. &quot;There is no such thing as a mystery in connection with any crime, provided intelligence is brought to bear upon its investigation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comparatively novel type of detective is Astro. This individual figures in a series of stories published in book form under title of &quot;The Master of Mysteries.&quot; These stories are by Mr. Gelett Burgess, but are published anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detective is a poseur, of a languid and self-conscious personality, who pretends to be a palmist and crystal-gazer, but who really is simply a clever sleuth detective. At his seances, conducted in draped and darkened apartments, he wears Oriental costume and is exceedingly bored. Instead of a Doctor Watson, he has for assistant a beautiful young woman named Valeska. The romance of these two runs through the book, and culminates on the last page with a &quot;clergyman and witnesses.&quot; But the stories are properly constructed detective fiction of good technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class of fiction which we shall group under this head must include all stories where the problem is invented and solved by the author and set forth in such a way as to give an astute reader opportunities for guessing or reasoning out the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An actual detective need not necessarily figure in the story, but detective work must be done by some of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There must be crime or apparent crime or attempted crime. But whether the problem is one of murder, robbery or kidnapping,—whether it be solved by evidence, deduction or a cryptogram,—it is detected, not guessed, and this is the main element in our classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average or typical Detective Story of to-day is the detailed narrative of the proceedings of an individual of unusual mental acumen in unraveling a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, a detective is a member of the police organization or of a private detective agency. But for fictional purposes he may be such, or he may be any one with what is called &quot;detective instinct&quot; or a taste for detective work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that in its earliest days the word &quot;detective&quot; meant merely a shadower or follower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A curious old story in &quot;Harper's Magazine&quot; for 1870 begins thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The remarkable skill and penetration shown by our modern detectives in &quot;shadowing&quot; suspected persons until sufficient proof has been obtained to warrant their arrest is illustrated by the daily history of crime. By the term &quot;shadowing&quot; is meant that vigilant watch kept upon the culprit by some one who follows him like his own shadow, and to do this successfully indicates no small degree of skill on the part of the &quot;detective.&quot; This last expression recalls to memory some strange facts which came to my knowledge in the early part of my life, and I can never meet the term in print or hear it in conversation without a painful reminiscence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story goes on to relate the harrowing experiences of a criminal who was shadowed by the ghost of his victim, and ends thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Such is the story in connection with the first use of the term &quot;detective,&quot; and I never meet it, either in voice or in print, without thinking of Captain Walton, and the fearful retribution unfolded in his history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this old story is not a Detective Story according to our classification, it is a simple Ghost Story. It is only of interest in referring to the earliest use of our word &quot;detective.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;rise-of-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;Rise of the Detective Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Detective Story as we know it was first written by Poe, yet he never used the descriptive word, nor was Dupin a detective, either professional or amateur, for when Poe wrote his immortal Dupin tales, the name &quot;Detective&quot; Stories had not been invented; the detective of fiction not having been as yet discovered. And the title is still something of a misnomer, for many narratives involving a puzzle of some sort, though belonging to the category which we shall discuss, are handled by the writer without expert detective aid. Sometimes the puzzle solves itself through operation of circumstance; sometimes somebody who professes no special detective skill happens upon the secret of its mystery; once in a while some venturesome genius has the courage to leave his enigma unexplained. But ever since Gaboriau created his Lecoq, the transcendent detective has been in favor; and Conan Doyle's famous gentleman analyst has given him a fresh lease of life, and reanimated the stage by reverting to the method of Poe. Sherlock Holmes is Dupin redivivus, and mutatus mutandis; personally he is a more stirring and engaging companion, but so far as kinship to probabilities or even possibilities is concerned, perhaps the older version of him is the more presentable. But in this age of marvels we seem less difficult to suit in this respect than our forefathers were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is, meanwhile, that, in the Riddle Story, the detective was an afterthought, or, more accurately, a deus ex mach- ina to make the story go. The riddle had to be unriddled; and who could do it so naturally and readily as a detective? The detective, as Poe saw him, was a means to this end; and it was only afterwards that writers perceived his availability as a character. Lecoq accordingly becomes a figure in fiction, and Sherlock, while he was yet a novelty, was nearly as attractive as the complications in which he involved himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detective Story writers in general, however, encounter the obvious embarrassment that their detective is obliged to lavish so much attention on the professional services which the exigencies of the tale demand of him, that he has very little leisure to attend to his own personal equation—the rather since the attitude of peering into a millstone is not, of itself, conducive to elucidations of oneself; the professional endowment obscures all the others. We ordinarily find, therefore, our author dismissing the individuality of his detective with a few strong black-chalk outlines, and devoting his main labor upon what he feels the reader will chiefly occupy his own ingenuity with,—namely, the elaboration of the riddle itself. Reader and writer sit down to a game, as it were, with the odds, of course, altogether on the latter's side,—apart from the fact that a writer sometimes permits himself a little cheating. It more often happens that the detective appears to be in the writer's pay, and aids the deception by leading the reader off on false scents. Be that as it may, the professional sleuth is in nine cases out of ten a dummy by malice prepense; and it might be plausibly argued that, in the interest of pure art, that is what he ought to be. But genius always finds a way that is better than the rules, and it will be found that the very best riddle stories contrive to drive character and riddle side by side, and to make each somehow enhance the effect of the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intention of the above paragraph will be more precisely conveyed if we include under the name of detective not only the man from the central office, but also anybody whom the writer may, for ends of his own, consider better qualified for that function. The latter is a professional detective so far as the exigencies of the tale are concerned, and what becomes of him after that, nobody need care,—there is no longer anything to prevent his becoming, in his own right, the most fascinating of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Poe's or Gaboriau's stories, appeared the &quot;Memoirs of Vidocq.&quot; This work, thought by many to be largely fiction, is the history of a clever villain who became a detective, though never called by that name. He was a Secret Agent, and is called on his own title page. Principal Agent of the French Police. His memoirs are old-fashioned, dull and uninteresting, but they show glimmerings of the kind of reasoning that later marked the Fiction Detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Gaboriau was the first author to use the terminology, since become so familiar, of detective, clues, deduction, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe ascribed to his Dupin, &quot;analytic ability,&quot; and this is all that is claimed for the conventional detective of fiction, though perhaps more acutely described by Brander Matthews as &quot;imaginative ratiocination.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe goes further in saying Dupin's work was &quot;The result of an excited or perhaps a diseased intelligence.&quot; This statement may have mirrored the author's own mind, for, while making no assertion. Professor Matthews observes that he should understand any one ho might declare that Poe had mental disease raised to the nth power, and we have long since been told that &quot;great wits are sure to madness near allied.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-detective-fictive-and-real&quot;&gt;The Detective: Fictive and Real&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is this very principle that marks the difference between the detective in fiction and in real life. The cleverest detectives in life are not men of diseased intellect, however greatly developed may be their powers of ratiocination. It is just that touch of abnormality, of superhuman reasoning, that makes a Transcendent Detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the work of the fiction detective is always successful. Naturally, because his work is planned to this end by the author. The fiction detective plays his game with marked cards. Though seemingly groping in the dark, he is walking a definite path laid straight to a definite end. He is pushed off on false scents, but pulled back and set right again by an adjusting power which does not exist in the case of real detectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the sooner the writer of detective fiction realizes that the detective of fiction has little in common with the detective in real life, the better is that author equipped for his work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real detective, for one thing, is rarely a man of culture or high ideals. The fiction detective is usually an aristocrat, unfortunately impoverished, or working at his art for art's sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real detective, however great his analytic ability, often finds that he cannot apply it to his case. The fiction detective never has this experience; he finds his case ready made and perfectly fitted to his powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real detective finds little or nothing in the way of useful material clues. The fiction detective finds his properties laid ready to his hand at the right moment. Dropped handkerchiefs, shreds of clothing, broken cuff-links, torn letters,—all are sprinkled in the path ahead of him, like roses strewn before a bride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Nature lends a helping hand to the favored detective of fiction. Usually &quot;A light snow had fallen the evening before.&quot; This snow is declared by credible witnesses to have begun at one psychological moment, and stopped at another; thus allowing the inevitable display of footprints of certain sizes, shapes and superimposition. Indeed the laws of nature are willing to give way, at need, and vegetation takes on unusual qualities to help along the good work. Sherlock Holmes continually finds his indicative footprints on turf or grass plot, and of course the criminal is identified at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real detective seldom if ever finds these helpful footprints at the right time and place. In case of his need of them, the obstinate ground is hard and unimpressionable; or the snow is melting and shows only oblong holes; or the grass refuses to present a clear and definite impression; or even if fairly respectable muddy footprints appear on a nice, clean, hard-wood floor, they are so incomplete in outline that they might have been made by any well-advertised shoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criminals and suspects in fiction must presumably wear shoes made for the purpose, with flat level soles that touch the floor at all points and leave an exact working diagram, instead of a shapeless blotch with ragged edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly with finger-prints. Though carefully impressed in incriminating places by the fiction criminals, in real life they are rarely found where they can be of use. The finger-prints found on the discarded empty frame of the Mona Lisa have not yet led to the recovery of the picture; whereas in fiction they would long ago have put the thief behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the fiction detective is not a real person, any more than the fairy godmother is a real person; but both are honored and popular celebrities in the realm of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if one would realize the immense superiority of the fiction detective for fiction purposes he has only to read any of the occasionally published &quot;true detective stories,&quot; or even those which are founded on actual cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;fiction-versus-fact&quot;&gt;Fiction versus Fact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, old-fashioned family papers published stories, beneath whose titles a line in parenthesis read, &quot;Founded on fact.&quot; Such tales were invariably uninteresting, and at last the editors learned not to publish them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true tale of a criminal problem and its solution is uninteresting because it is not planned to be interesting. The technique of the detective story calls for the same kind of planning and preparation on the part of the author as does a successful act of legerdemain. The prestidigitator takes a rabbit out of a silk hat, but unless he had planned for it beforehand he couldn't do it. What he might take, unplanned, out of the hat,—its leather band or gilt stamped lining,—would be of no interest to his audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the old-fashioned or the inexperienced author who thinks that an incident which has come within his own experience or that of his friends, is necessarily available for a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Gelett Burgess' celebrated Bromides is, &quot;Now this thing really happened!&quot; And it is a fortunate writer who escapes the occasional, &quot;I've something to tell you about my neighbor's mother-in-law; I know it to be true, and you can have it for one of your stories!&quot; The enthusiastic generosity of the speaker causes his face to glow with the delight of &quot;helping an author,&quot; and how can you tell him that not one in a million such anecdotes would be of use to you, and that moreover, your head and note-book are both crammed with material of the right sort waiting to be used?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your helpful friend makes no claim save that his story is a fact, and he can never understand how apt is this quality to bar it from fiction. He can never understand the difference between fact and truth—truth, the wide universal element that must be adhered to; and fact, the petty and narrow incident that is rarely of interest, and often indeed contradicts truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realism, according to its American master, Mr. W.D. Howells, is nothing more than the truthful treatment of material; and in Mr. Howells' hands this treatment has produced writings of absorbing interest. But it is an equally truthful treatment of material that appears in the Social and Personal column of the Miller's Comers Weekly Gazette, or in the Congressional Record, yet we are not interested in either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the plot of a Detective Story, or in the mental makeup of the detective, realism finds little place—as much as you wish in the material details, in the clues, the inquest, or the suspected butler, but the key-note of the story itself is that of pure fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must seem to be true as fairy stories seem true to children. You must persuade your readers to believe it, as Peter Pan wheedled his audience into believing in fairies; but &quot;Founded on Fact&quot; or &quot;Elaborated from the Records of a Real Detective,&quot; is fatal to the interest of a Detective Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the argument ring true, let the accessories be realistic, let the situations be logical and the conditions plausible; but let the magic of the unreal detective tinkle through it all as fairies dance in real moonlight. Sustain the interest by a subtly woven chain of events that leads unerringly to the climax in a way the uncertainties of real life can never do. Lead your readers on to the re-solution of the problem, whose terms have been stated in logical sequence straight through the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uninitiate say, &quot;You're so fond of detective stories, I suppose you read all the murder trials in the newspapers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, a true lover of detective fiction never reads detailed newspaper accounts of crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should he? He reads detective fiction for the enjoyment of the complete and finished entertainment therein provided. The statement of the problem, the interesting development, the breathless chase after false clues, the never tiring return to the right track and the final rounding up of the explanatory solution—he knows when he starts he will be disappointed in no particular. Every mystery will be explained and the fun is in trying to explain them himself. As an antagonist at chess, he pits himself against his opponent, the author, and endeavors to foresee and understand his feints and maneuvers. But to whatever degree he succeeds in this, a complete revelation awaits him at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In real life a criminal case reported in the papers gives no assurance of ultimate solution, gives no assurance that all the developments are intentional and go to make up a complete and harmonious whole; that the whole story is so balanced and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;poised, so coherent and interdependent as to give only satisfaction to its readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a word, the Detective Story of fiction is art; the accounts in the newspapers of the crimes of the day are merely the truthful treatment of material; and the latter, unless seen through the medium of an artist, is not of interest to the lover of the Detective Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another argument against realism in this field of fiction, is the fact that from the nature of its plot the details of a Detective Story are often unlovely. The newspapers delight in realistic description of the gruesome elements of crime. The Detective Story writer in the interests of his art glosses these over, not only because they have no necessary bearing on his theme, &quot;The riddle and its solution,&quot; but because they jar on the reader's taste and disturb his economy of attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe, whose imagination was beyond all bounds, thus speaks of realism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The defenders of this pitiable stuff uphold it on the ground of its truthfulness. Taking the thesis into question, this truthfulness is the one overwhelming defect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;An original idea that—to laud the accuracy with which the stone is hurled that knocks us in the head! A little less accuracy might have left us more brains. And here are critics absolutely commending the truthfulness with which only the disagreeable is conveyed! In my view, if an artist must paint decayed cheeses, his merit will lie in their looking as little like decayed cheeses as possible!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, the writer of detective fiction pictures as much cheese and as little decay as he may.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tale of horror, or of gruesome interest, which not only paints the decayed cheese with realism, but with exaggeration, is not a Detective Story, it belongs in another class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course all this applies to Detective Stories which are constructed in harmony with the unwritten but inexorable laws which require the aforementioned qualities. To be sure, plenty of Detective Stories are written which violate every requirement of true technique, but these are not in our argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is well discussed by Mr. Cecil Chesterton:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I have read hundreds of such tales which made excellent reading so long as the mystery subsisted, but of which the conclusion was unspeakably weak and far- fetched and in some cases absolutely unintelligible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nothing is more irritant in a detective story than that even one mysterious circumstance should remain at the end unexplained. Yet the writers appear to imagine that it is quite sufficient if they have thought of some sort of explanation of the central mystery, while a hundred attendant facts, introduced solely to puzzle or mislead the reader, are left without even a suggestion to illumine them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Indeed the conclusion ought to be not merely plausible, but in a sense inevitable. The reader ought not indeed to expect it, but he ought to feel afterwards that he ought to have expected it. To explain the problem at the last moment, as is often done, by introducing new circumstances at which he could not possibly have guessed, is merely to leave him labouring under a half-conscious sense of injury and resentment, and rightly so, for he has been cheated into attempting to solve a puzzle which, as it turns out, was for him quite insoluble. In an ideal detective story all the clues to the true solution ought to be there from the first, but so overlaid as to pass unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If anyone wishes to see how this can be done, let him read attentively the first two or three chapters of 'The Moonstone1, by Wilkie Collins. Here the all-important conversation between Franklyn Blake and the doctor is given at length, but in such a context as to appear a mere incident designed to throw light on a phase of Franklyn's temperament.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently there has been published a book of short true Detective Stories. (&lt;em&gt;Adventures of the World's Greatest Detectives&lt;/em&gt;, George Barton.) These are of so little interest as to be almost unreadable. The preface says, &quot;Crime in itself, is painful and sometimes repulsive, but a study of the methods of criminal investigation by which difficult problems are solved and the guilty brought to justice is entertaining and may be profitable. &quot;While the foregoing is true, the study of the methods of criminal investigation is not entertaining to the reader, unless written as literature,—indeed, as fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple description of a crime and the methods pursued in regard to its investigation make dry reading. The setting, the characters, the atmosphere, of a well-constructed story are necessary to make it entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preface we quote goes on to state frankly that the detectives they tell about, work in the most prosaic manner imaginable, but they somehow manage to get results, and that is what counts in the police world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have merely facts. Their work doubtless is prosaic, but a prosaic account of it entertains nobody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us look at one of the stories of this book. It begins thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One crisp December morning Louis Hanier, a Frenchman, the owner of a little wine shop on West Twenty- sixth street in New York City, was found dead in the hallway of his home. The bullet of a .38-caliber revolver was discovered in the man's heart.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He had been murdered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, and suppose he had been. Outside of the impulse of common humanity, the reader has no interest in Louis Hanier. This is not the reader's fault. He cannot be expected to have an interest in a mere name. But the author of detective fiction will arouse such an interest in the reader's mind before announcing the murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we are informed that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The problem was to find the man who had committed the crime—to pick him out of the millions of people in New York City. The newspapers were filled with the horrible story. The coroner's inquest attracted the usual crowd of morbid-minded people. The minor police officials became very busy—and accomplished nothing. After the hysterics were over, the puzzle finally made its way to the one man in New York City who had the genius and persistence to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, as stated, rouses no thrill of expectancy. There is no cause for interest, wonder, or curiosity. It is all &quot;The truthful treatment of the material,&quot; and has no art in presentation or implication. Now we come to the description of the detective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a few minutes the door opened and a strong, well- built man with square shoulders shambled into the room.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He had gray hair, a thick nose, blue eyes, a smooth face and a perpetual smile. He glanced about him in a furtive way and realized that he was in the presence of the triumvirate of talent that ruled the under-world of Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He squared himself as a man would who was preparing to be on the defensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A commonplace description of a commonplace man, which does not in the least provoke our desire to know more of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, through the dull and prosy story, we read the uneventful proceedings which led to the conviction of the criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never would Detective Stories have a vogue if they were written thus. But it is not so much the presence of the facts as the absence of the fiction that is the trouble. The plain unvarnished statements leave us no room for expectation, no reason for surprise. Detective Stories are not built around truthful incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another volume of &quot;True Stories of Crime&quot;, by Arthur Train, gives us this foreword:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The narratives composing this book are literally true stories of crime. In a majority of the cases the author conducted the prosecutions himself, and therefore may claim to have a personal knowledge of that whereof he speaks. While no confidence has been abused, no essential facts have been omitted, distorted, or colored, and the accounts themselves, being all matters of public record, may be easily verified. The scenes recorded here are not literature but history, and the characters who figure in them are not puppets of the imagination, but men and women who lived and schemed, laughed, sinned and suffered, and paid the price when the time came, most of them, without flinching. A few of those who read these pages may profit perhaps by their example; others may gain somewhat in their knowledge of life and human nature; but all will agree that there are books in the running brooks, even if the streams be turbid, and sermons in stones, though these be the hearts of men. If in some instances the narratives savor in treatment more of fiction than of fact, the writer must plead guilty to having fallen under the spell of the romance of his subject, and he proffers the excuse that, whereas such tales have lost nothing in accuracy, they may have gained in the truth of their final impression.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stories in this book may be interesting to a lover of human documents, but to the reader of &quot;Detective Stories,&quot; they are dull and prosy, except where &quot;the writer fell under the spell of romance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-interest-of-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;The Interest of the Detective Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe says, in speaking of the writer's plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A skillful literary artist has constructed a tale. If wise, he has not fashioned his thoughts to accommodate his incidents; but having conceived, with deliberate care, a certain unique or single effect to be wrought out, he then invents such incidents—he then combines such events as may best aid him in establishing this preconceived effect. If his very initial sentence tend not to the outbringing of this effect, then he has failed in his first step. In the whole composition there should be no word written, of which the tendency direct or indirect, is not to the one pre-established design. And by such means, with such care and skill, a picture is at length painted which leaves in the mind of him who contemplates it with a kindred art, a sense of the fullest satisfaction.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interest of the Detective Story depends entirely on its rousing the reader's curiosity. Every detail of its plan must sustain and heighten an intense determination to know the solution of the riddle; and as this curiosity becomes keener, and this determination more inflexible, so much more necessary is it that the explanation shall be adequate and satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this result cannot be achieved if the author undertakes his work in the spirit shown by the authors of &quot;The Wrecker&quot;, Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne, when they say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We had long been at once attracted and repelled by that very modern form of the police novel or mystery story, which consists in beginning your yarn anywhere but at the beginning, and finishing it anywhere but at the end; attracted by its peculiar interest when done, and the peculiar difficulties that attend its execution; repelled by that appearance of insincerity and shallowness of tone, which seems its inevitable drawback. For the mind of the reader, always bent to pick up clews, receives no impression of reality or life, rather of an airless, elaborate mechanism; and the book remains enthralling, but insignificant, like a game of chess, not a work of human art. It seemed the cause might lie partly in the abrupt attack; and that if the tale were gradually approached, some of the characters introduced (as it were) beforehand, and the book started in the tone of a novel of manners and experience briefly treated, this defect might be lessened and our mystery seem to inhere in life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technique of the Mystery Story does not permit it to be a novel of manners, and yet the manners must not be neglected. If a Detective Story is to be literature, what may be called its manners must be looked after quite as carefully as its plot, though by no means with such conspicuous result. Intrinsic merit must be the real basis of its interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the care and artistic conscience that count, notwithstanding the ideas expressed in &quot;The Wrecker&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Julian Hawthorne truly says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You cannot make a riddle story by beginning it and then trusting to luck to bring it to an end. You must know all about the end and the middle before thinking, even, of the beginning; the beginning of a riddle story, unlike those of other stories and of other enterprises, is not half the battle; it is next to being quite unimportant, and, moreover, it is always easy. The unexplained corpse lies weltering in its gore in the first paragraph; the inexplicable cipher presents its enigma at the turning of the opening page. The writer who is secure in the knowledge that he has got a good thing coming, and has arranged the manner and details of its coming, cannot go far wrong with his exordium; he wants to get into action at once, and that is his best assurance that he will do it in the right way. But O! what a labor and sweat it is; what a planning and trimming; what a remodeling, curtailing, interlining; what despairs succeeded by new lights, what heroic expedients tried at the last moment, and dismissed the moment after; what wastepaper baskets full of futilities, and what gallant commencements all over again! Did the reader know, or remotely suspect, what terrific struggles the writer of a really good detective story had sustained, he would regard the final product with a new wonder and respect, and read it all over once more to find out how the troubles occurred. But he will search in vain; there are no signs of them left; no, not so much as a scar. The tale moves along as smoothly and inevitably as oiled machinery; obviously, it could not have been arranged otherwise than it is; and the wise reader is convinced that he could have done the thing himself without half trying. At that, the weary writer smiles a bitter smile; but it is one of the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes. Nobody, except him who has tried it, will ever know how hard it is to write a really good detective story. The man or woman who can do it can also write a good play (according to modern ideas of plays), and possesses force of character, individuality, and mental ability. He or she must combine the intuition of the artist with the talent of the master mechanic, but will seldom be a poet, and will generally care more for things and events than for fellow creatures.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Julian Hawthorne also discusses this question of interest as maintained by the inverse order of narration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;… One charge, at least, does lie against the door of the riddle-story writer; and that is, that he is not sincere; he makes his mysteries backward, and knows the answer to his riddle before he states its terms. He deliberately supplies his reader, also, with all manner of false scents, well knowing them to be such; and concocts various seeming artless and innocent remarks and allusions, which in reality are diabolically artful, and would deceive the very elect. All this, I say, must be conceded; but it is not unfair; the very object, ostensibly, of the riddle story is to prompt you to sharpen your wits; and as you are yourself the real detective in the case, so you must regard your author as the real criminal whom you are to detect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is safe to say that Poe's conception of the interest-element in the Detective Story, as illustrated by his three great tales, &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue,&quot; &quot;The Purloined Letter,&quot; and &quot;The Mystery of Marie Roget,11 was that the great point was not the fascination of the mystery itself but the interest the reader would take in following the successive steps of reasoning by which the crime was ferreted out. The reader is thus turned into an analytical observer who not only delights in the mental ingenuity exhibited by the detective, but actually joins with him in working out the intricacies of a problem which, though at first seemingly insoluble, is at length mastered entirely. Thus his admiration for the &quot;investigator&quot; is happily coupled with his own delight in unraveling the skein which the author has woven expressly for the purpose, as Poe himself expresses it when he admits all the merits of the device, but modestly disclaims that his ingenious stories have real greatness. He speaks thus about them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;They owe most of their popularity to being something in a new key. I do not mean to say that they are not ingenious—but people think them more ingenious than they are—on account of their method and air of method. In the 'Murders in the Rue Morgue,1 for instance, where is the ingenuity of unraveling a web which you yourself (the author) have woven for the express purpose of unraveling? The reader is made to confound the ingenuity of the supposititious Dupin with that of the writer of the story.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the ingenuity of the author and that of his character are identical, as they are in the case of Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctor Doyle admits frankly his indebtedness to Poe, and though he claims another prototype than Dupin for his detective, yet he makes this acknowledgment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Edgar Allan Poe, who, in his carelessly prodigal fashion, threw out the seeds from which so many of our present forms of literature have sprung, was the father of the detective tale, and covered its limits so completely that I fail to see how his followers can find any fresh ground which they can confidently call their own. For the secret of the thinness and also of the intensity of the detective story is that the writer is left with only one quality, that of intellectual acuteness, with which to endow his hearer. Everything else is outside the picture and weakens the effect. The problem and its solution must form the theme, and the character drawing is limited and subordinate. On this narrow path the writer must walk, and he sees the footmarks of Poe always in front of him. He is happy if he ever finds the means of breaking away and striking out on some little side-track of his own.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;a-summing-up&quot;&gt;A Summing Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, then, we must agree that for devotees the Detective Story sets a stirring mental exercise, with just enough of the complex background of life to distinguish it from a problem in mathematics. Whatever thrills of horror are excited come by way of the intellect, never starting directly in the emotions. The reader divests himself of sympathy, and applies to every situation the dry light of reason. It is only when one's reason is baffled, leaving the murder unexplained or the ghost at large, that one feels privileged to shudder. And such a shudder is remarkably different from a start that is unthinking. The Detective Story applies reason to some of the big half-mysteries of human conduct; and the result for the ordinary reader is not dissimilar to that felt by the philosopher when trying to square with his poor apparatus the secrets of Nature and Providence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-detectives-of-poe-doyle-and-gaboriau&quot;&gt;The Detectives of Poe, Doyle, and Gaboriau&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conan Doyle's Detective Stories, being short-stories, more closely resemble Poe's tales than Gaboriau's novels do. Perhaps this is due more to a certain analogy of structure than to the actual working mentality of the detective. Dupin and his historian have rooms together, just as Holmes and Watson do. In each case the curiosity of the historian is first aroused by noticing the unconventional habits and studies of his companion. Dupin has his detractors among the official police, just as Holmes has his Greyson and his Lestrade, and Lecoq his Gevrol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the fatuous Watson chronicles his friend's exploits with even franker admiration than the nameless companion of Dupin, but they are equally earnest in their graphic and detailed recitals. It is to be regretted that so definite a character as Dupin's historian had no name for his better identification, that like Doctor Watson he might have &quot;passed into the language.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Brander Matthews gives this interesting dissertation upon the Teller of Poe's tales:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Upon the preternaturally acute observer who was to control the machinery of the tale, the American poet be stowed a companion of only an average alertness and keen ness; and to this commonplace companion the romance: confided the telling of the story. By this seemingly simple device Poe doubled the effectiveness of his work, because this unobservant and unimaginative narrator of the unraveling of a tangled skein by an observant and imaginative analyst naturally recorded his own admiration and astonishment as the wonder was wrought before his eyes, so that the admiration and astonishment were transmitted directly and suggestively, to the readers of the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In the 'Gold-Bug' the wonder-worker is Legrand, and in both the 'Murders in the Rue Morgue' and the 'Purloined Letter1 he is M. Dupin; and in all three tales the telling of the story is entrusted to an anonymous narrator, serving not only as a sort of Greek chorus to hint to the spectators the emotions they ought to feel, but also as the describer of the personality and peculiarities of Legrand and Dupin, who are thus individualized, humanized, and related to the real world. If they had not been accepted by the narrator as actual beings of flesh and blood, they might otherwise retain the thinness and the dryness of disembodied intelligences working in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This device of the transmitting narrator is indisputably valuable; and, properly enough, it reappears in the one series of detective tales which may be thought by some to rival Poe's. The alluring record of the investigations of Mr. Sherlock Holmes is the work of a certain Dr. Watson, a human being but little more clearly characterized than the anonymous narrators who have preserved for us the memory of Legrand and Dupin. But Poe here again exhibited a more artistic reserve than any of his imitators, in so far as he refrained from the undue laudation of the strange intellectual feats which are the central interest of these three tales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In the 'Gold Bug' he even heightens his suspense by allowing the narrator to suggest that Legrand might be of unsound mind; and in the 'Murders in the Rue Morgue' the narrator, although lost in astonishment at the acuteness of Dupin, never permits his admiration to become fulsome; he holds himself in, as though fearing that overpraise might provoke a denial. Moreover, Poe refrained from all exhibitions of Dupin's skill merely for its own sake exhibitions only dazzling the spectators and not furthering his immediate purpose.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watson is doubtless fulsome, but like begets like, and the Reading Public, quick to take the cue, are also fulsome in praise of Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Mr. Arthur Bartlett Maurice, Sherlock Holmes possesses the attributes of both Poe's and Gaboriau's heroes. Mr. Maurice asserts that, &quot;If in one line we can trace the ancestry of Sherlock Holmes to Edgar Allan Poe's Dupin, in another we can work back to Gaboriau, not, however, to the great Lecoq, but to old Tabaret, better known to the official police who are introduced into the tales as Pere Tirauclair. From Dupin, Holmes derived his intellectual acumen, his faculty of mentally placing himself in the position of another, and thereby divining the other's motives and plans, his raising of the observation of minute outward details to the dignity of an exact science. Pere Tirauclair inspired him to that wide knowledge of criminal and contemporary history which enabled him to throw a light on the most puzzling problem and to find some analogy to the most outre case. With Lecoq, Holmes has absolutely nothing in common.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We object to this last clause. If nothing more, Sherlock Holmes certainly has methods of procedure in common with Gaboriau's detectives. Tirauclair, Lecoq's master and teacher, conducts his investigations after this manner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As the old fellow spoke, his little gray eyes dilated and became brilliant as carbuncles. His face reflected an internal satisfaction even his wrinkles seemed to laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His figure became erect, and his step was almost elastic, as he darted into the inner chamber. He remained there about half an hour; then came out running, then reentered and then again came out; once more he reappeared and disappeared again almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The magistrate could not help comparing him to a pointer on the scent, his turned up nose even moved about as if to discover some subtle odor left by the assassin. All the while he talked loudly and with much gesticulation, apostrophizing himself, scolding himself, uttering little cries of triumph or self-encouragement. He did not allow Lecoq to have a moment's rest. He wanted this or that or the other thing. He demanded paper and a pencil. Then he wanted a spade; and finally he cried out for plaster of Paris, some water and a bottle of oil. When more than an hour had elapsed, the investigating magistrate began to grow impatient, and asked what had become of the amateur detective. &quot;He is on the road,&quot; replied the corporal, &quot;lying flat in the mud, and mixing some plaster in a plate. He says he has nearly finished, and that he is coming back presently.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes when setting forth on a similar investigation conducts himself not dissimilarly. We quote from &quot;A Study in Scarlet:&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He whipped a tape measure and a large, round magnifying-glass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once lying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pure blooded, well trained fox-hound as it dashes backward and forward through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place he gathered very carefully a little pile of gray dust from the floor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally he examined with his glass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result by Gaboriau's man is announced in these words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The assassin then gained admission without difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He is a young man, a little above the middle height, elegantly dressed. He wore on that evening a high hat. He carried an umbrella, and smoked a trabucos cigar in a holder.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Sherlock Holmes triumphantly asserts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There has been murder done, and the murderer was a man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, square- toed boots, and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore-leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Widow Lerouge,&quot; from which the above Gaboriau extracts are quoted, the discomfited Inspector, Gevrol, exclaims, &quot;Ridiculous! this is too much!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in the other case, Lestrade and Gregson content themselves with glancing at each other with an incredulous smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Maurice further observes: &quot;The deductions of Dupin and of Sherlock Holmes we are ready to accept, because we feel that it is romance, and in romance we care to refute only what seriously jars our sense of what is logical; we take those of Le- coq, because they convince beyond all question, because when one has been forced upon us, we are ready defiantly to maintain that no other is possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Dupin himself refers to his own work thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I said 'legitimate deductions;1 but my meaning is not thus fully expressed. I designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones, and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;individuality-of-these-detectives&quot;&gt;Individuality of these Detectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attitude of the Transcendent Detective toward other detectives with whom he comes in contact is—doubtless because of the fierce light that beats upon his throne—one of complacent superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecoq expresses himself thus, and Sherlock Holmes and his heirs and successors forever, voice similar sentiments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;That will do,&quot; interrupted M Lecoq. &quot;If I choose to lend you a helping hand, it is because it suits my fancy to do so. It pleases me to be the head, and to let you be the hand. Unassisted, with your preconceived ideas, you never would have found the culprit; if we two together don't find him, my name is not Lecoq.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;M. Lecoq shrugged his shoulders. 'You are an ass!' exclaimed he. 'Why, don't you know that on the very day you were sent for with the commissary to verify the fact of the robbery, you held—I do not say certainly, but very probably held—in your great stupid hands the means of knowing which key had been used when the money was stolen.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;How is that?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You want to know, do you? I will tell you. Do you remember the scratch you discovered on the safe? You were so struck by it, that you could not refrain from calling out directly you saw it. You carefully examined it, and were convinced that it was a fresh scratch, only a few hours old. You thought too, and rightly too, that this scratch was made at the time of the theft. Now, with what was it made? Evidently with a key. That being the case, you should have asked for the keys both of the banker and the cashier. One of them would have probably had some particles of the hard green paint sticking to it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fanferlot listened with open mouth to this explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the last words, he violently slapped his forehead with his hand and cried out: &quot;Idiot! Idiot!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You have correctly named yourself,&quot; said M. Lecoq. &quot;Idiot! This proof stares you right in the face, and you don't see it! This scratch is the only clue there is to follow, and you must like a fool neglect it. If I find the guilty party, it will be by means of this scratch; and I am determined that I will find him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes thus delivers himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you think of it, sir?&quot; they both asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to help you,&quot; remarked my friend. &quot;You are doing so well now that it would be a pity for any one to interfere.&quot; There was a world of sarcasm in his voice, as he spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he walks a good deal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Moonstone&quot; the superiority of Sergeant Cuff to the Police officer is thus cleverly remarked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why Superintendent Seegrave should have appeared to be several sizes smaller than life, on being presented to Sergeant Cuff, I can't undertake to explain. I can only state the fact. They retired together; and remained a weary long time shut up from all mortal intrusion. When they came out Mr. Superintendent was excited and Mr. Sergeant was yawning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The Sergeant wishes to see Miss Verinder's sitting room,&quot; says Mr. Seegrave, addressing me with great pomp and eagerness. &quot;The Sergeant may have some questions to ask. Attend the Sergeant, if you please!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While I was being ordered about in this way, I looked at the great Cuff. The great Cuff, on his side, looked at Superintendent Seegrave in that quietly expecting way which I have already noticed. I can't affirm that he was on the watch for his brother officer's speedy appearance in the character of an ass—I can only say that I strongly suspected it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Edmund Clarence Stedman tells us that, &quot;Poe could teach Continental writers very little in the art of perfecting their own romance. His analytic tales made a great impression. Their ratiocination, applied to the solution of criminal mysteries, captured the Parisian fancy more readily than the quality of his other prose writings. Since then, detective stories of high and low degree have been written in France, England, and America; but no amateur, with a genius approximating to that of 'Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin,' has appeared, and had his exploits recounted, in our own or foreign literature.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-real-sherlock-holmes&quot;&gt;The Real Sherlock Holmes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conan Doyle himself, or rather a friend of his, one Doctor Harold Emery Jones, denies Sherlock Holmes' dependence on any fictional detective. Thus Doctor Jones on the subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The writer was a fellow-student of Conan Doyle. Together they attended the surgical demonstrations of Joseph Bell, at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. This man exhibited incredibly acute and sure deductive powers in diagnosis and in guessing the vocation of patients from external signs. Sir Henry Littlejohn, another medical lecturer, heard by the two students, was remarkable for his sagacious expert testimony, leading to the conviction of many a criminal. Thus is the character of Sherlock Holmes easily and naturally accounted for, and the absurd fiction that Conan Doyle drew upon Poe for his ideas is silenced forever.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In further account of Joseph Bell, Doctor Jones continues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;He is the original Sherlock Holmes—the Edinburgh medical students' ideal—who could tell patients their habits, their occupations, nationality, and often their names, and who rarely, if ever, made a mistake. Oftentimes he would call upon one of the students to diagnose the cases for him. Telling the House Surgeon to usher in a new patient, he delighted in putting the deductive powers of the student to the test, with results generally amusing, except to the poor student victim himself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bell was as full of dry humor and satire, and he was as jealous of his reputation, as the detective Sherlock Holmes ever thought of being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, in the lecture theatre, he gave the students a long talk on the necessity for the members of the medical profession cultivating their senses—sight, smell, taste, and hearing. Before him on a table stood a large tumbler filled with a dark, amber-colored liquid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This, gentlemen,&quot; announced the Professor, &quot;contains a very potent drug. To the taste it is intensely bitter. It is most offensive to the sense of smell. Yet, as far as the sense of sight is concerned—that is, in color—it is no different from dozens of other liquids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Now I want to see how many of you gentlemen have educated your powers of perception. Of course, we might easily analyze this chemically, and find out what it is. But I want you to test it by smell and taste; and, as I don't ask anything of my students which I wouldn't be willing to do myself, I will taste it before passing it round.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here he dipped his finger in the liquid, and placed it in his mouth. The tumbler was passed round. With wry and sour faces the students followed the Professor's lead. One after another tasted the vile decoction; varied and amusing were the grimaces made. The tumbler, having gone the round, was returned to the Professor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said he, with a laugh, &quot;I am deeply grieved to find that not one of you has developed this power of perception, which I so often speak about; for if you had watched me closely, you would have found that while I placed my forefinger in the medicine, it was the middle finger which found its way into my mouth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These methods of Bell impressed Doyle greatly at the time. The impression made was a lasting one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding this matter Conan Doyle thus writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Sherlock Holmes is the literary embodiment, if I may so express it, of my memory of a professor of medicine at Edinburgh University, who would sit in the patients' waiting-room with a face like a red Indian, and diagnose the people as they came in before even they had opened their mouths. He would tell them their symptoms, he would give them details of their lives, and he would hardly ever make a mistake.&quot; This professor was Dr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Joseph Bell, and that the resemblance to Sherlock Holmes was not merely intellectual, but strikingly physical as well, may be seen from the accompanying portrait. There are the same sharp, piercing eyes, the eagle nose, and the hawk-like features. Like Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell was in the habit of sitting in his chair with his fingers pressed together when engaged in solving a problem. Twenty-seven years ago Conan Doyle came in contact with him when he was finishing his medical studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; Professor Bell would say to the students standing around, &quot;I am not quite sure whether this man is a cork-cutter or a slater. I observe a slight callous, or hardening, on one side of his forefinger, and a little thickening on the outside of his thumb, and that is a sure sign he is either one or the other.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dr. Bell, as well as Sherlock Holmes, was often inclined to be highly dramatic in the exposition of his singular faculties. A patient would enter his consulting-room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah,&quot; the Professor would say, &quot;I perceive that you are a soldier, a non-commissioned officer, and that you have served in Bermuda.&quot; The man would acknowledge the correctness of the indictment, and the students would express their surprise. &quot;How did I know that, gentlemen? The matter is simplicity itself. He came into the room without taking his hat off, as he would go into an orderly's room. He was a soldier. A slight authoritative air, combined with his age, shows that he was a noncommissioned officer. A slight rash on the forehead tells me that he was in Bermuda, and subject to a certain rash known only there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Conan Doyle began building up a scientific system by which everything might be logically reasoned out. Along purely intellectual lines Poe had done that before with M. Dupin. Sherlock Holmes was practical and systematic, and where he differed from Dupin was that in consequence of his previous scientific education he possessed a vast fund of exact knowledge from which to draw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he had written twenty-six stories about Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle determined that it would be bad policy to continue and decided to put an end to his hero. He feared that Holmes was becoming tiresome to others as well as to himself. Above all, he was afraid that the public would come to think that he had only one idea and could write only one kind of story. Dr. Doyle was in Switzerland at the time. One day, while on a walking tour through the country, he came to a waterfall, and immediately saw in it a romantic spot for anyone who wished to meet a spectacular death. Then and there he mentally mapped out &quot;The Final Problem,&quot; in which Holmes and Moriarty settled accounts. But Holmes's death, instead of being welcomed, roused indignant protest. One lady wrote a letter to the author which began &quot;You beast.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">The fictional detectives of Edgar Allen Poe, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Émile Gaboriau, were both imitations of each other and completely unique creations. Whether inspired by the others' creations or by true life mentors, detectives of fiction, especially Dupin, Holmes and Lecoq stand out amongst the rest as monuments to the deductive mind.</summary>

&lt;p&gt;Deduction, in a definite and restricted sense, is the motif of most of the detective stories of to-day. It is an unusually perspicacious analytic deduction from inconspicuous clues that we call ratiocination, or more familiarly, the detective instinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;ratiocination-in-early-detective-stories&quot;&gt;Ratiocination in Early Detective Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A story quoted in one of the earlier chapters, called &quot;The Sultan and his Three Sons,&quot; is a very ancient specimen of analytic deduction. Though it is, in turn, doubtless founded on an even older tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Centuries later the stories of the Sultan's sons reappeared almost verbatim in a story by the Chevalier de Mailly, entitled &quot;Voyage et Aventure des Trois Princes de Sarendip,&quot; which appeared in 1719. De Mailly's version is substantially as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three princes, starting out on their journey, encounter a camel-driver who has lost one of his herd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have noticed the tracks of such an animal though not seen him and when asked by the driver if they know of his whereabouts, the eldest replies: &quot;Was he not blind?&quot; The second: &quot;Did he not have a tooth out?&quot; The third: &quot;Was he not lame?&quot; The camel-driver assents with delight to the questions and continues on his way rejoicing. Not finding his camel, however he returns and accuses them of bantering with him. &quot;To prove that what we say is so,&quot; said the eldest, &quot;your camel carried butter on one side and honey on the other.&quot; The second: &quot;And a lady rode the camel,&quot; etc. In the same manner they are arrested for theft and sentenced. And in the same manner the camel is refound and an explanation is given: &quot;I judged that the camel was blind because I noticed that on one side of the road all the grass was gnawed down, while the other side was untouched. Therefore, I inferred that he had but one eye, else he would not have left the good to eat the poor grass.&quot; &quot;I found in the road mouthfuls of half-chewed herbage the size of a tooth of just such an animal,&quot; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly thirty years later Voltaire practically repeated the story in his &quot;Zadig,&quot; related thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Zadig found by experience that the first month of marriage, as it is written in the book of Zend, is the moon of honey, and that the second is the moon of wormwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He was sometime afterward obliged to repudiate Azora, who became too difficult to be pleased; and he then sought for happiness in the study of nature. &quot;No man,11 said he, &quot;can be happier than a philosopher who reads in this great book which God hath placed before our eyes. The truths he discovers are his own, he nourishes and exalts his soul, he lives in peace; he fears nothing from men; a his tender spouse will not come to cut off his nose.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Possessed of these ideas he retired to a country house on the banks of the Euphrates. There he did not employ himself in calculating how many inches of water flow in a second of time under the arches of a bridge, or whether there fell a cube line of rain in the month of the house more than in the month of the Sheep. He never dreamed of making silk of cobwebs, or porcelain of broken bottles; but he chiefly studied the properties of plants and animals and soon acquired a sagacity that made him discover a thousand differences where other men see nothing but uniformity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One day, as he was walking near a little wood, he saw one of the queen's eunuchs running toward him, followed by several officers who appeared to be in great perplexity, and who ran to and fro like men distracted, eagerly searching for something they had lost of great value. &quot;Young man,&quot; said the first eunuch, &quot;hast thou seen the queen's dog?&quot; &quot;It is a female,&quot; replied Zadig. &quot;Thou art in the right,&quot; returned the first eunuch. &quot;It is a very small she spaniel,&quot; added Zadig; &quot;she has lately whelped; she limps on the left forefoot, and has very long ears.&quot; &quot;Thou hast seen her,&quot; said the first eunuch, quite out of breath. &quot;No,&quot; replied Zadig, &quot;I have not seen her, nor did I so much as know that the queen had a dog.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Exactly at the same time, by one of the common freaks of fortune, the finest horse in the king's stable had escaped from the jockey in the plains of Babylon. The principal huntsman and all the other officers ran after him with as much eagerness and anxiety as the first eunuch had done after the spaniel. The principal huntsman addressed himself to Zadig, and asked him if he had not seen the king's horse passing by. &quot;He is the fleetest horse in the king's stable,&quot; replied Zadig; &quot;he is five feet high, with very small hoofs, and a tail three feet and a half in length; the studs on his bit are gold of twenty- three carats, and his shoes are silver of eleven pennyweights.&quot; &quot;What way did he take? Where is he?&quot; demanded the chief huntsman. &quot;I have not seen him,&quot; replied Zadig, &quot;and never heard talk of him before.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The principal huntsman and the first eunuch never doubted but that Zadig had stolen the king's horse and the queen's spaniel. They therefore had him conducted before the assembly of the grand desterham who condemned him to the knout, and to spend the rest of his days in Siberia. Hardly was the sentence passed when the horse and the spaniel were both found. The judges were reduced to the disagreeable necessity of reversing their sentence; but they condemned Zadig to pay four hundred ounces of gold for having said that he had not seen what he had seen. This fine he was obliged to pay; after which he was permitted to plead his cause before the counsel of the grand desterham, when he spoke to the following effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ye stars of justice, abyss of sciences, mirrors of truth, who have the weight of lead, the hardness of iron, the splendor of the diamond, and many properties of gold: Since I am permitted to speak before this august assembly, I swear to you by Oramades that I have never seen the queen's respectable spaniel, nor the sacred horse of the king of kings. The truth of the matter was as follows: I was walking toward the little wood, where I afterwards met the venerable eunuch, and the most illustrious chief huntsman. I observed on the sand the traces of an animal, and could easily perceive them to be those of a little dog. The light and long furrows impressed on little eminences of sand between the marks of the paws plainly discovered that it was a female, whose dugs were hanging down, and that therefore she must have whelped a few days before. Other traces of a different kind, that always appeared to have gently brushed the surface of the sand near the marks of the forefeet, showed me that she had very long ears; and as I remarked that there was always a slighter impression made on the sand by one foot than the other three, I found that the spaniel of our august queen was a little lame, if I may be allowed the expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;With regard to the horse of the king of kings, you will be pleased to know that, walking in the lanes of this wood, I observed the marks of a horse's shoes, all at equal distances. This must he a horse, said I to myself, that gallops excellently. The dust on the trees in the road that was but seven feet wide was a little brushed off, at the distance of three feet and a half from the middle of the road. This horse, said I, has a tail three feet and a half long, which being whisked to the right and left, has swept away the dust. I observed under the trees that formed an arbor five feet in height, that the leaves of the branches were newly fallen; from whence I inferred that the horse had touched them, and that he must therefore be five feet high. As to his bit, it must be gold of twenty- three carats, for he had rubbed his bosses against a stone which I knew to be a touchstone, and which I have tried. In a word, from the marks made by his shoes on flints of another kind, I concluded that he was shod with silver eleven deniers fine.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only a single instance of Zadig's ratiocination, but Voltaire gives us many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe's stories follow precisely this same narrow path, and after him trail Gaboriau, Du Boisgobey, Conan Doyle and the rest of the long procession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;deduction-used-in-every-day-life&quot;&gt;Deduction Used in Every-day Life&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this adaptation from Oriental lore is no disparagement of Poe's talent. He was the first to write a coherent and self-contained story whose interest depends solely on the application of human intelligence to the solution of a mystery. Others have done so since; and this peculiar trait of analytic deduction is by no means confined to detectives or to Detective Story writers. The average human being in every-day life, often without being definitely conscious of it, performs absolute ratiocination. It is only the extreme application of this principle, or an unusual demonstration of it in connection with interesting circumstances, that gives interest to a Detective Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Professor Matthews says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Huxley has pointed out that the method of Zadig is the method which has made possible the incessant scientific discovery of the last century. It is the method of Wellington at Assaye, assuming that there must be a ford at a certain place on the river because there was a village on each side. It is the method of Grant at Vicksburg, examining the knapsacks of the Confederate soldiers slain in a sortie to see if these contained rations, which would show that the garrison was seeking to break out because the place was untenable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also it was the method of the North American Indian following a trail. It is the method of the housemother in dealing with her servants, her children, and perhaps her husband. In all walks of life it is more or less an available and practiced method, and this is one reason why it is of popular interest in a story, because it mirrors, though with the necessary exaggeration of art, the possibilities of every-day life and the working results of every-day philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much philosophy goes to the make-up of a Detective Story. And it is to a great extent the truth and worth of this philosophy that determines the value of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mr. Chesterton's opinion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The idea that you cannot put good philosophy into certain art-forms is as absurd and mischievous as the idea that you cannot put good workmanship into them. Mr. Shaw, for example, has put his philosophy into the form of ordinary melodrama in 'The Devil's Disciple.' Ibsen has put his into the form of pantomimic extravaganza in 'Peer Gynt.1 There is no earthly reason why a man with a specific talent for the work should not put ideas as profound into the form of the detective story. For after all the essence of the detective story is the presence of visible phenomena with a hidden explanation. And that, when one comes to think of it, is the essence of all the philosophies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-analytical-element-in-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;The Analytical Element in the Detective Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the invention and construction of the story, setting forth the puzzle in an attractive way, and continuing with sound reasoning and philosophy to a logical and satisfactory end, that arrests and holds the reader's attention. And the skilled author devises every circumstance of his tale with the one intent, to whet the reader's desire to arrive at the author's solution simultaneously with, if not ahead of the author's detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Poe himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The mental features discoursed of as the analytical are, in themselves, but little susceptible of analysis. We appreciate them only in their effects. We know of them, among other things, that they are always to their possessor, when inordinately possessed, a source of the liveliest enjoyment. As the strong man exults in his physical ability, delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the analyst in that moral activity which disentangles. He derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play. He is fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his solution of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension preternatural. His results, brought about by the very soul and essence of method, have, in truth, the whole air of intuition.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this air of intuition, even though we know it is absolutely not intuition, that we seek in Detective Stories. We wish to be amazed by the mysteries, sure that in due time they will be explained. We enjoy being confronted by absolute paradox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Maupassant says, &quot;How weak our head is, and how quickly it is terrified and goes astray, as soon as we are struck by a small incomprehensible fact. Instead of concluding with these simple words: 'I do not understand because the cause escapes me,' we immediately imagine terrible mysteries as supernatural powers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very fine yet clear distinction is made by Poe which is not always carefully observed by his imitators or successors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The analytical power should not be confounded with simple ingenuity; for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis. The constructive or combining power, by which ingenuity is usually manifested, and to which the phrenologists (I believe erroneously) have assigned a separate organ, supposing it a primitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon idiocy, as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals. Between ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater, indeed, than that between the fancy and the imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous. It will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;poes-detectivethe-prototype&quot;&gt;Poe's Detective—The Prototype&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These principles, more or less clearly understood and adhered to, make up the conventional Fiction Detectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stripped of their distinguishing characteristics, their morphine, knotted string, eccentric habits, or scientific appliances, they all depend for their right to exist, on their application of Poe's principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But notwithstanding that the later authors have followed so closely in the narrow path trodden by Poe, it is by no means sure that had Poe, Gaboriau and Conan Doyle never lived, others might not have been pioneers in this field of fiction, and even those who had never heard of Zadig and who knew no Oriental tales. For the detective instinct is not uncommon, and given its presence in combination with Nature's gift of a gray goose quill, a resulting Detective Story is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is Poe's assertion that analytic reasoning is oftenest the identification of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent, and he illustrates it thus, in &quot;The Purloined Letter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I knew a schoolboy about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration. This game is simple, and is played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, 'are they even or odd?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our schoolboy replies, 'odd,' and loses; but upon the second trial he wins, for he then says to himself, 'the simpleton had them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd;'—he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;'This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before. I will therefore guess even;—he guesses even, and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellows termed 'lucky,1—what in its last analysis, is it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is merely,&quot; I said, &quot;an identification of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is,&quot; said Dupin, &quot;and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I received answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see what sentiments or thoughts arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or correspond with the expression.' This response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to Rochefoucauld, to LaBruyere, to Machiavelli, and to Campanella.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps spurious profundity is too harsh a term, for the profundity after all is only in the eye of the observer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In similar case was the country boy who found a lost horse. After the owner of the horse and his friends had failed to find the animal that had strayed away, the bumpkin started off by himself, and soon returned bringing the horse with him. &quot;How did you find him?&quot; was the query. &quot;Why,&quot; returned the rustic, &quot;I thought if I was a horse, where would I go. And I went there, and he had.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This embodies much of the seemingly magical wisdom of the fiction detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-detective-in-the-novel&quot;&gt;The Detective in the Novel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some thirty years after Poe's Dupin, Gaboriau invented his Le- coq. As Gaboriau's stories are all novels, while Poe's are short- stories or novelettes, there is, of course, more setting, with more characters and more complex plot, in the French stories. But as a personality Gaboriau's detective stands out quite as clearly as Poe's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An able critic thus compares Lecoq and Sherlock Holmes. He says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The fact is that Sherlock Holmes was too perfect a detective for the stories of which he is the hero to be perfect detective stories. The conception of the ideal reasoner, the man in whom the powers of observation and deduction had become so acute that he saw instantly the remote causes and the remote consequences of every fact, was a fine one. Poe had conceived it before, but Sir Arthur amplified and popularized it. In one of his conversations with Watson, Holmes is, I remember, very severe on Lecoq, whom he pronounces 'a bungler. Certainly Lecoq had no presence to the faultless insight of his critic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He was a clever and energetic detective, but no miracle worker. He made mistakes, he followed false scents, he led the reader astray. And so he made the story. In a word, Lecoq was a bungler because Gaboriau was an expert.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is there not another and a better explanation why Holmes was forced to jump at his conclusions immediately, while Lecoq could blunder and retrieve his blunders? Is it not because all the Sherlock Holmes stories are short-stories, and all the Gaboriau stories are full-sized novels? To fill three hundred or more pages necessitates bungling, false leads, mistaken clues and fresh starts. While a Sherlock Holmes story, being told in a few thousand words, necessitates quick action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Lecoq's bungles are as interesting as his successful work. When need arises for the expanding of the story, Lecoq converses thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;But here I hesitate. I thought myself sure of the character of these murderers; but now        11 He paused; and his contracted features clearly showed that he was engaged in a mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;But now?&quot; asked M. Plantat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;M. Lecoq seemed to wake up. &quot;I beg your pardon/1 said he. &quot;I forget myself. I've a bad habit of reflecting aloud. That's why I almost always insist on working alone. My uncertainty and hesitation, the waywardness of my suspicions, compromise my reputation as an astute detective, for whom there's no such thing as a mystery.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Worthy M. Plantat smiled indulgently. &quot;I don't usually open my mouth,&quot; continued M. Lecoq, &quot;until my mind is satisfied; then I speak in a peremptory tone, and say this is so or so. To-day, however, I am working openly with a man who realizes that such a problem as this cannot be solved at the first attempt. This is why I allow you to see how I grope along. One can't always reach the truth at a bound; to realize it at times various calculations and deductions are necessary. Well, just now my logic is at fault.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again in &quot;File No. 113,&quot; Lecoq says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Our enemies are on the alert, and we must crush them instantly. I have made a mistake. I have been on the wrong track; it is an accident liable to happen to any man, no matter how intelligent he may be. I took the effect for the cause. The day I was convinced that culpable relations existed between Raoul and Madame Fauvel, I thought I held the end of the thread that would lead us to the truth. I ought to have been more mistrustful; this solution was too simple, too natural.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is indeed proof that Lecoq is a bungler because Gaboriau is an expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his own words Lecoq thus gives an account of his methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A crime is committed—that is the prologue; I reach the scene; the first act begins. At a glance I note the scenery. Then I try to divine the motive of the crime; I group the various characters together, and link the different episodes to the central fact. The action soon reaches a crisis; the thread of my inductions enables me to name the guilty person; I search for him, arrest him, and deliver him up. Then comes the great scene; he struggles, resorts to every device in hopes of cheating justice; but the examining magistrate, armed with the weapons I have forged for him, overwhelms the scoundrel; he does not confess, but he is confounded. And then round the principal personage all kinds of secondary characters are grouped—accomplices, perhaps friends, enemies, witnesses of every description. Some of them may excite alarm, others claim respect, and others again are simply grotesque. The horrible always has its ludicrous side. My last scene is the assize court. The public prosecutor speaks, but his ideas are mine. His oratory is so much embroidery set round the canvas of my report. At last the presiding judge submits his questions to the jury; the fate of my drama is to be decided. Perhaps the jury answers, 'Not guilty,1 and that means my piece was bad, and I must allow myself to be hissed; but if the verdict's 'Guilty,' then the piece was good, I am victorious, and receive my meed of applause. The next day I can go and see my hero, slap him on the shoulder, and say, 'You have lost, old fellow; I was one too much for you!&quot;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet this is not extraneous matter, it is an inherent part of the story of &quot;The Mystery of Orcival.&quot; If this detective's tricks and manners are more dilatory, or described at greater length than those of Sherlock Holmes, it is entirely because he is a character in a book instead of in a short-story. Gaboriau had his faults, but they were in other respects than the art of his detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reversing the more usual plan of having an amateur detective as a foil for the hero detective, Lecoq has Father Tabaret to whom he defers, as the secondary character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of Sherlock Holmes' assumption of superiority over his secondary character, we have Father Tabaret laying down the law to the humble hero detective. It is thus the picturesque old Frenchman admonishes Lecoq:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Wait a little,&quot; said he, &quot;before you disdain my praises. I said you had conducted the affair well, but you might have done it infinitely better. You have great gifts, I avow, you have the true detective's instincts, and a keen glance, you know how to sift the known from the unknown; only you are lacking in experience, and are too full of enthusiasm, and are apt to grow discouraged at a slight check. You hover round a fixed idea like a moth flutters; round the flame of a candle; but you are young, and will get over this; however, as I said before, you have made some successes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lecoq bent his head like a pupil receiving a reproof from his professor. Was not this old man the master, and he a mere scholar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I will point out all your faults to you,&quot; continued the old man, &quot;and will show you how on three occasions, at least, you permitted a good chance to slip through your fingers, and so failed to clear up an affair which to outward appearances was so deeply bathed in obscurity, but which in reality was as transparent as crystal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;And yet, sir        &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hush, hush, my boy, permit me to speak. On what principle did you start at the first going off? On this one—to mistrust all appearances, and to believe precisely the contrary to what appeared to be the truth or even the probability.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, that is just what I said to myself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;And you did right in saying so. Taking this idea as lantern to light you on your way, you ought to have gone straight to the truth. But as I said before, you are young, and the first likely circumstances that you met with, made you entirely neglect your rule of action.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of Doyle's stories, Sherlock Holmes himself states definitely his principles of deduction in what purports to be a magazine article written by himself. The opening paragraph, however, is in the words of the faithful Dr. Watson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;sherlock-holmes-method&quot;&gt;Sherlock Holmes' Method&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its somewhat ambitious title was &quot;The Book of Life,11 and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and absurdity. The reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle, or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man's inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that, until they learned the processes by which be had arrived at them, they might well consider him a necromancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;From a drop of water,&quot; said the writer, &quot;a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other. So all life is a great chain the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study, nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection of it. Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the inquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems. Let him, on meeting a fellow mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation and teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man's finger-nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser-knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt cuffs—by each of these things a man's calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent inquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the sentence last quoted that proclaims the Transcendent Detective, and it is this element of omniscience that gives him such popularity and homage as is received by any other worker in magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of this sort of deduction let us examine definitely some of Sherlock Holmes' work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical in every respect, are his deductions from an old hat as here given:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard, and much the worse for wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discolored. There was no maker's name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials &quot;H.B.&quot; were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discolored patches by smearing them with ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I can see nothing,&quot; said I, handing it back to my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. &quot;It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,&quot; he remarked, &quot;and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;My dear Holmes!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,&quot; he continued, disregarding my remonstrances. &quot;He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more potent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by-the-way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You are certainly joking. Holmes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I have no doubt that I am very stupid; but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. &quot;It is a question of cubic capacity,&quot; said he; &quot;a man with so large a brain must have something in it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The decline of his fortunes, then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes laughed. &quot;Here is the foresight,&quot; said he, putting his finger upon the little disk and loop of the hat securer. &quot;They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see he had broken the elastic, and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavored to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Your reasoning is certainly plausible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odor of lime-cream. The dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, gray dust of the street, but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time; while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could, therefore, hardly be in the best of training.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.&quot; &quot;This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;But he might be a bachelor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg.&quot; &quot;You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow; walks upstairs at night, probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will follow this with a similar example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Seven!&quot; I answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.&quot; &quot;Then, how do you know?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;My dear Holmes,&quot; said I, &quot;this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess; but, as I have changed my clothes, I can't imagine how you deduce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice; but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is simplicity itself,&quot; said he; &quot;my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot- slitting specimen of the London slavery. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his early acquaintance Watson doubted Holmes ability at this sort of deduction, and said to him, by way of test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it. Now, I have here a watch which has recently come into my possession. Would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Though unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren,&quot; Holmes observed, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack lustre eyes. &quot;Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother, who inherited it from your father.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;That you gather, no doubt, from the H.W. upon the back?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Quite so. The W. suggests your own name. The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch: So it was made for the last generation. Jewellery usually descends to the eldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as his father. Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.&quot; &quot;Right, so far,&quot; said I. &quot;Anything else?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;He was a man of untidy habits—very untidy and careless. He was left with good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity, and finally taking to drink, he died. That is all I can gather.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with considerable bitterness in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This is unworthy of you. Holmes,&quot; I said. &quot;I could not have believed that you would have descended to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You have made inquiries into the history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way. You cannot expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch! It is unkind, and to speak plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;My dear doctor,&quot; said he kindly, &quot;pray accept my apologies. Viewing the matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you. I assure you, however, that I never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts? They are absolutely correct in every particular.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend. For example, I began by stating that your brother was careless. When you observe the lower part of that watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places, but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket. Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty- guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man. Neither is it a very far-fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take a watch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the inside of the case. It is more handy than a label, as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed. There are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case. Inference that your brother was often at low water. Secondary inference—that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could not have redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the inner plate, which contains the keyhole. Look at the thousand of scratches all round the hole—marks where the key has slipped. What sober man's key could have scored those grooves? But you will never see a drunkard's watch without them. He winds it at night, and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand. Where is the mystery in all this?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is as clear as daylight,&quot; I answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. &quot;When I hear you give your reasons,&quot; I remarked, &quot;the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled, until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.&quot; &quot;Quite so,&quot; he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an arm-chair. &quot;You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Frequently.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;How often?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, some hundreds of times.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Then how many are there?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;How many? I don't know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;lecoqs-method&quot;&gt;Lecoq's Method&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecoq announces his deductions with rather more dramatic circumlocution. With nothing to deduce from but footprints in the snow, he at last cries triumphantly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Now I know everything.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, dear, that is a big word to say.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;When I say everything, I mean everything that has reference to the drama played at the Widow Chupin's which has culminated in bloodshed. This deserted piece of land covered with snow is like a vast white page of a book, and the persons whom we are hunting have written upon it, not only their movements and their proceedings, but also the secret doubts, hopes, and fears which are agitating their souls. What do these fleeting footprints teach you, old man? Nothing; well, to me they are as full of life as the people who have left them behind; they breathe, they speak, and they denounce!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His conclusions being received somewhat dubiously he proceeds more definitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Listen, then,&quot; continued Lecoq, &quot;to the writing as I read it. While the murderer was taking the two women to the Poivriere, his companion or his accomplice, as I think I may call him, waited for him here. He was a middle-aged man, rather tall, wore a soft hat and a brown woolly great-coat; he was probably married, as he wore a wedding-ring on the little finger of his right hand.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the usual, &quot;this is too much!&quot; he continues his recital:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We have come, old fellow, to the moment when the accomplice had mounted guard here, and the time seemed to him rather long. To make the time pass, he walked backward and forward the length of the beam, and every now and then stopped to listen, so as to break the monotony of his promenade. As he heard nothing he stamped his feet, doubtless saying to himself, 'What the deuce is the other fellow doing down there?1 He had walked up and down thirty times, for I have counted them, when a dull sound broke the silence—the two women were coming.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;other-methods&quot;&gt;Other Methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is purely and simply the reasoning of Zadig and the early Orientals. On the whole this sort of &quot;spurious profundity&quot; is not difficult in detective fiction, however often it might fail to prove in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Present Writer, moved to attempt it, wrote the following scene in a story, the characters being a Transcendant Detective and an Admiring Friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I met him, accidentally one morning, when we both chanced to go into a basement of the Metropolis Hotel to have our shoes shined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While waiting our turn to get a chair, we stood talking, and, seeing a pair of shoes standing on a table, evidently there to be cleaned, I said banteringly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Now, I suppose. Stone, from looking at those shoes, you can deduce all there is to know about the owner of them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With a mild twinkle in his eye, but with a perfectly grave face, he said slowly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Those shoes belong to a young man, five feet eight inches high. He does not live in New York, but is here to visit his sweetheart. She lives in Brooklyn, is five feet nine inches tall, and is deaf in her left ear. They went to the theatre last night, and neither was in evening dress.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I stared at him incredulously, as I always did when confronted by his astonishing &quot;deductions,&quot; and simply said: &quot;Tell this little Missourian all about it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It did sound well, reeled off like that, didn't it?&quot; he observed, chuckling more at my air of eager curiosity than at his own achievement. &quot;But it's absurdly easy, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He is a young man because his shoes are in the very latest, extreme, not exclusive style. He is five feet eight, because the size of his foot goes with that height of man, which, by the way, is the height of nine out of ten men, any way. He doesn't live in New York or he wouldn't be stopping at a hotel. Besides, he would be down-town at this hour, attending to business.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Unless he has freak business hours, as you and I do,11 I put in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, that might be. But I still hold that he doesn't live in New York, or he couldn't be staying at this Broadway hotel overnight, and sending his shoes down to be shined at half-past nine in the morning. His sweetheart is five feet nine, for that is the height of a tall girl. I know she is tall, for she wears a long skirt. Short girls wear short skirts, which make them look shorter still, and tall girls wear very long skirts, which make them look taller.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Why do they do that?&quot; I inquired, greatly interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't know. You'll have to ask that of some one wiser than I. But I know it's a fact. A girl wouldn't be considered really tall if less than five feet nine. So I know that's her height. She is his sweetheart, for no man would go from New York to Brooklyn and bring a lady over here to the theatre, and then take her home, and return to New York in the early hours of morning, if he were not in love with her. I know she lives in Brooklyn, for the paper says there was a heavy shower there last night, while I know no rain fell in New York. I know that they were out in that rain, for her long skirt became muddy, and in turn muddied the whole upper of his left shoe. The fact that only the left shoe is so soiled proves that he walked only at her right side, showing that she must be deaf in her left ear, or he would have walked part of the time on that side. I know that they went to the theatre in New York, because he is still sleeping at this hour, and has sent his boots down to be cleaned, instead of coming down with them on his feet to be shined here. If he had been merely calling on the girl in Brooklyn, he would have been home early, for they do not sit up late in that borough. I know they went to the theatre, instead of to the opera or a ball, for they did not go in a cab, otherwise her skirt would not have become muddied. This, too, shows that she wore a cloth skirt, and as his shoes are not patent leathers, it is clear that neither was in evening dress.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I didn't try to get a verification of Fleming Stone's assertions; I didn't want any. Scores of times I had known him to make similar deductions, and in cases where we afterward learned the facts, he was invariably correct. So, though we didn't follow up this matter, I was sure he was right, and, even if he hadn't been, it would not have weighed heavily against his large proportion of proved successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, being fiction, these astute deductions were correct in every particular, and led ultimately to the conviction of the criminal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;holmes-method-evaluated&quot;&gt;Holmes' Method Evaluated&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A side light on Sherlock Holmes' character is shown by his attitude regarding the explanation of his own deduction. Doctor Watson thus expresses it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Like all Holmes' reasoning the thing seemed simplicity itself when it was once explained. He read the thought upon my features, and his smile had a tinge of bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I am afraid that I rather give myself away when I explain,&quot; said he. &quot;Results without causes are much more impressive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this is all part of the author's art, for it grasps the reader's sympathy and understanding, and forestalls his own slight feeling of disappointment at the exposed simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all of Sherlock Holmes' deductions are quite as marvelous as Watson asserts. For instance, a strong point is made by Holmes, in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles,&quot; after reading a message concocted by means of pasting on paper words cut from a newspaper, and declaring at once that the words were cut from the London Times. Ability to distinguish the type of one great newspaper from another is not at all uncommon among newspaper readers. As a matter of fact, a large portion of the reading public could tell at once from what newspaper words were cut. It is the photographic memory rather than the analytic mind which performs this feat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, not all of Holmes' deductions are true in every detail. A pair of gold rimmed eye-glasses leads him to declare their owner &quot;a person of refinement and well-dressed,&quot; for, he says &quot;it is inconceivable that any one who wore such glasses could be slatternly in other respects.&quot; And yet, such conditions have often been known. But in the story, of course the lady proved to be refined and well-dressed, and thus the Transendent Detective's deductions were verified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, of course, the spectacular deductions, the plays to the grand stand, that make for popularity. And no one could better combine the rational commonplace and the marvelous 'spurious profundity' than Doctor Doyle has done in the character of Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But much of this profound reasoning is far from spurious. In a moment of a serious dissertation on his own art, we learn this about it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The ideal reasoner,&quot; he remarked, &quot;would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it, but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents, should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilize all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavored in my case to do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-inductive-and-the-deductive-methods&quot;&gt;The Inductive and the Deductive Methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not easy for the untutored reader or writer of detective stories always to differentiate between inductive and deductive reasoning. Perhaps some light may be thrown on this abstruse subject by reading carefully this extract from a book by Arlo Bates, entitled &quot;Talks on Writing English.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is proper and perhaps even important that the student shall learn the distinction which is made by logicians between reasoning which is inductive and that which is deductive. As a matter of practical work in the writing of arguments, the distinction is of less importance than might seem from the formality with which these terms are treated; but as Induction and Deduction are words which the true logician cannot mention without at least a seeming impulse to cross himself, it is well to know what the difference is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Induction, then, is reasoning from the particular to the general; the establishment of an hypothesis by showing that the facts agree with it. It is preeminently the scientific method. By observing natural phenomena, the scientist conceives what the law which governs them must be. This idea of the general principle is then the hypothesis which he attempts to prove; and his method is to examine the facts under all conditions possible, establishing his proposition by showing that the facts are in accord with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Deduction is the converse of this, and consists in drawing out particular truths from general ones. A universal proposition may be regarded as a bundle in which are bound together many individual ones. It is the work of deduction to take these out,—to separate any one of them from the rest. The general truth, 'All metals are elements,1 includes in it the especial truths, 'Iron is an element,' 'Gold is an Element,' and so on for each metal which could be named. Deduction is the process of separating one of these from the whole. Speaking broadly, scientific reasoning is more likely to be inductive, while other reasoning is more likely to be deductive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;two-striking-examples&quot;&gt;Two Striking Examples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A favorite exploit of the Transcendent Detective, is to follow silently another's train of thought; and then suddenly and seemingly with clairvoyance, announce what the other's thoughts are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is done first by Poe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were strolling one night down a long dirty street, in the vicinity of the Palais Royal. Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least. All at once Dupin broke forth with these words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;He is a very little fellow, that's true, and would do better for the Theatre des Varietes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There can be no doubt of that,&quot; I replied unwittingly, and not at first observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations. In an instant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was profound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Dupin,&quot; said I gravely, &quot;this is beyond my comprehension. I do not hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses. How was it possible that you should know I was thinking of—?&quot; Here I paused, to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I thought.—&quot;of Chantilly,&quot; said he, &quot;why do you pause?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections. Chantilly was a quondam cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming stage-mad, had attempted the role of Xerxes, in Crebillon's tragedy so-called, and been notoriously pasquinaded for his pains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Tell me, for Heaven's sake,&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;the method—if method there is—by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter.&quot; In fact, I was even more startled than I would have been willing to express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It was the fruiterer,&quot; replied my friend, &quot;who brought you to the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for Xerxes et id genus omne.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The fruiterer!—you astonish me—I know no fruiterer whomsoever.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The man who ran up against you as we entered the street—it may have been fifteen minutes ago.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a large basket of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we passed from the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rue C        into the thoroughfare where we stood; but what had this to do with Chantilly I could not possibly understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There was not a particle of charlatanerie about Dupin. &quot;I will explain,&quot; he said, &quot;and, that you may comprehend all clearly, we will first retrace the course of your meditations, from the moment in which I spoke to you until that of the rencontre with the fruiterer in question. The larger links of the chain run thus—Chantilly, Orion, Dr. Nichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer.11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives, amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained. The occupation is often full of interest; and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the starting-point and the goal. What, then, must have been my amazement when I heard the Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth. He continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We had been talking of horses, if I remember right, just before leaving the Rue C—. This was the last subject that we discussed. As we crossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a large basket upon his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon a pile of paving-stones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair. You stepped upon one of the loose fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile, and then proceeded in silence. I was not particularly attentive to what you did; but observation has become with me, of late, a species of necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You kept your eyes upon the ground—glancing, with a petulant expression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement (so that I saw you were still thinking of the stones), until we reached the little alley called Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of experiment with the overlapping and riveted blocks. Here your countenance brightened up, and, perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the word 'stereotomy,1 a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I knew that you could not say to yourself 'stereotomy' without being brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago I mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice the vague guesses of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do so. You did look up; and I was now assured that I had correctly followed your steps. But in that bitter tirade upon Chantilly, which appeared in yesterday's Musee, the satirists, making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler's change of name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line about which we have often conversed. I mean the line 'Perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written Urion; and, from certain pungencies connected with the explanation, I was aware that you could not have forgotten it. It was clear, therefore, that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of Orion and Chantilly. That you did combine them I saw by the character of the smile which passed over your lips. You thought of the poor Cobbler's immolation. So far, you had been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself up to your full height. I was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of Chantilly. At this point I interrupted your meditations to remark that as, in fact, he was a very little fellow—that Chantilly—he would do better at the Theatre des Varietes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feat is paralleled in the Sherlock Holmes story entitled &quot;The Resident Patient&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation, I had tossed aside the barren paper, and leaning back in my chair, I fell into a brown study. Suddenly my companion's voice broke in upon my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You are right, Watson,&quot; said he. &quot;It does seem a very preposterous way of settling a dispute.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Most preposterous!&quot; I exclaimed, and then, suddenly realizing how he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair and stared at him in blank amazement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What is this. Holmes?&quot; I cried. &quot;This is beyond anything which I could have imagined.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He laughed heartily at my perplexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You remember,&quot; said he, &quot;that some little time ago, when I read you the passage in one of Poe's sketches, in which a close reasoner follows the unspoken thoughts of his companion, you were inclined to treat the matter as a mere tour de force of the author. On my remarking that I was constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed incredulity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, no!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Perhaps not with your tongue, my dear Watson, but certainly with your eyebrows. So when I saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a train of thought, I was very happy to have the opportunity of reading it off, and eventually of breaking into it, as a proof that I had been in rapport with you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But I was still far from satisfied. &quot;In the example which you read to me,&quot; said I, &quot;the reasoner drew his conclusions from the actions of the man whom he observed. If I remember right, he stumbled over a heap of stones, looked up at the stars, and so on. But I have been seated quietly in my chair, and what clews can I have given you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You do yourself an injustice. The features are given to man as the means by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are faithful servants.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my features?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Your features, and especially your eyes. Perhaps you cannot yourself recall how your reverie commenced?&quot; &quot;No, I cannot.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Then I will tell you. After throwing down your paper, which was the action which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression. Then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly-framed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by the alteration in your face that a train of thought had been started. But it did not lead very far. Your eyes turned across to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which stands upon the top of your books. You then glanced up at the wall, and of course your meaning was obvious. You were thinking that if the portrait were framed it would just cover that bare space and correspond with Gordon's picture over there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You have followed me wonderfully!&quot; I exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;So far I could hardly have gone astray. But now your thoughts went back to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were studying the character in his features. Then your eyes ceased to pucker, but you continued to look across, and your face was thoughtful. You were recalling the incidents of Beecher's career. I was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf of the North at the time of the Civil War, for I remember you expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was received by the more turbulent of our people. You felt so strongly about it that I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that also. When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the picture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil War, and when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled, and your hands clinched, I was positive that you were indeed thinking of the gallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle. But then, again, your face grew sadder; you shook your head. You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life. Your hand stole towards your own old wound, and a smile quivered on your lips, which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of settling international questions had forced itself upon your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At this point I agreed with you that it was preposterous, and was glad to find that all my deductions had been correct.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Absolutely!&quot; said I. &quot;And now that you have explained it, I confess that I am as amazed as before.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you. I should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day. But the evening has brought a breeze with it. What do you say to a ramble through London?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close observation is one of the high cards of the fiction detective's game. Dupin is often described as scrutinizing with great minuteness of attention everything in the vicinity of the scene of the crime. We subjoin an account of the search for &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot; as an example of what a thorough search really means to the Transcendent Detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Suppose you detail,&quot; said I, &quot;the particulars of your search.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Why, the fact is, we took our time, and we searched everywhere. I have had long experience in these affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I took the entire building, room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined first, the furniture of each apartment, we opened every possible drawer; and I presume that you know that, to a properly trained police agent, such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a 'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain. There is a certain amount of bulk—of space—to be accounted for in every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ. From the tables we removed the tops.&quot; &quot;Why so?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the top replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?&quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wad ding of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we were obliged to proceed without noise.&quot; &quot;But you could not have removed—you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention. A letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the chairs?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Certainly not; but we did better—we examined the rungs of every chair in the Hotel, and, indeed, the jointings of every description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the gluing—any unusual gaping in the joints—would have sufficed to insure detection.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates, and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as the curtains and carpets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;That, of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We divided its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The two houses adjoining!&quot; I exclaimed; &quot;you must have had a great deal of trouble.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We had; but the reward offered is prodigious.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You include the grounds about the houses?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it undisturbed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You looked among D—'s papers, of course, and into the books of the library?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our police officers. We also measured the thickness of every book cover, with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the bindings been recently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with the needles.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You explored the floors beneath the carpets?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the microscope.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;And the paper on the walls?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You looked into the cellars?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We did.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Then,&quot; I said, &quot;you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter is not upon the premises, as you suppose.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I fear you are right there,&quot; said the Prefect. &quot;And now, Dupin, what would you advise me to do?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;To make a thorough re-search of the premises.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecoq pursues the same methods of close scrutiny, and we find him in Gaboriau's &quot;The Crime of Orcival,&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;… lifting the fallen furniture, studying its fractures, examining the smallest bits of wood or stuff to see if they might betray the truth. Now and then he took out an instrument case, from which he produced a shank, with which he unlocked various drawers. Finding a towel hanging over a rack, he carefully put it on one side, as if he deemed it of importance. He went to and fro between the bedroom and the count's study, without losing a word of what was being said—making indeed a mental note both of the remarks themselves and of the tone in which they were exchanged.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to Sherlock Holmes, it is not necessary to refer to his microscopic examinations. In fact, so addicted is he to the use of the lens, that it has become a by-word in connection with his methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this close observation must have something to observe; the magnifying glass must have something to magnify; and these things must be of vital importance as evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-search-for-clues&quot;&gt;The Search for Clues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could rarely be compassed in real life, but it is, of course, easy for the author to provide the tiny clues necessary to his hero's microscope work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And tiny clues are a favorite device of the detective story writer. There is a fascination about the solving of a big murder mystery by a bit of a broken cuff-link; or the tracing of a professional burglar by a speck of cigarette ash. Of course, the philosophy is that these clues are so small as to be unnoticed by the criminal who so conveniently leaves them behind him. Also they are unnoticed by the amateur or the Central Office sleuth, and so redound to the glory of the Transcendent Detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most of all their use is to impress and astound the reader by a picturesque application of the truth that great oaks from little acorns grow. It is the dramatic contrast of the tiny indication that points the way to the enormous result of discovering the perpetrator of an atrocious crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here again we have the great gulf fixed between the Real Detective and the Fiction Detective. Take the vital point in &quot;File No. 113.&quot; Now really there is not one chance in a thousand that the particle of green paint would have been found adhering to that key, had the key been found. Green paint will adhere most annoyingly to clothing, or hands, or even keys when it is not desired, but if needed as criminal evidence it will in all probability be found wanting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the field of fiction is as a salted mine. What is searched for is found, and the detective triumphantly ferrets out the infinitesimal clues that have been most carefully put in place by the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Sherlock Holmes looked for a burnt match in &quot;Silver Blaze,&quot; he found it, though the really careful inspector had carefully overlooked it. This is the account of the scene:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;My dear Inspector, you surpass yourself!&quot; Holmes took the bag, and, descending into the hollow, he pushed the matting into a more central position. Then stretching himself upon his face and leaning his chin upon his hands, he made a careful study of the trampled mud in front of him. &quot;Hullo!&quot; said he, suddenly. &quot;What's this?&quot; It was a wax vesta half burned, which was so coated with mud that it looked at first like a little chip of wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I cannot think how I came to overlook it,&quot; said the Inspector, with an expression of annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It was invisible, buried in the mud. I only saw it because I was looking for it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What! you expected to find it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I thought it not unlikely.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fine instance of spectacular detective work. And this is what is demanded for the true technique of the Mystery Story. It is not real life; it is a stage, set with the furnishings and properties of the dramatic plot. The dropped handkerchiefs, the shreds of cloth or torn bits of paper, are carefully placed, and the detective has only to step along and pick them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilkie Collins' creation. Sergeant Cuff, sanctions it emphatically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I made a private inquiry last week, Mr. Superintendent,&quot; he said. &quot;At one end of the inquiry there was a murder, and at the other end there was a spot of ink on a table-cloth that nobody could account for. In all my experience along the dirtiest ways of this dirty little world I have never met with such a thing as a trifle yet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A case in point, is this bit from &quot;The Whispering Man:&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I turned to go. Just as I did so, my eye caught a glint from the carpet, of what I took to be a bent pin. Quite automatically—for by nature I am an orderly and methodical person—I stooped and picked it up. It was not a pin after all, but the broken end of a curved needle. It made no particular impression on my mind, and I was on the point of dropping it into the waste-paper basket when something stopped me. It was no very definite idea, probably just a reminiscence from detective stories I had read, of the immense importance of the most trivial things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was this that Lowell had in mind, when he said that Poe &quot;combined in a very remarkable manner two faculties which are seldom found united,—a power of influencing the mind of the reader by the impalpable shadows of mystery, and a minuteness of detail which does not leave a pin or a button unnoticed. Both are, in truth, the natural results of the predominating quality of his mind, to which we have before alluded,—analysis.&quot; And the same principle is approved of in real life by Mr. Arthur C. Train's assertion: &quot;The discovery and proper proof of minute facts which tend to demonstrate the guilt of an accused are the joy of the natural prosecutor, and he may in his enthusiasm spend many thousands of dollars on what seems, and often is, an immaterial matter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-bizarre-in-crime&quot;&gt;The Bizarre in Crime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deep conviction of the Transcendent Detective is that a crime containing unusual or even bizarre characteristics is more easy of solution than a commonplace one. This is a somewhat disingenuous proposition; for the real reason that the bizarre crime is preferable, is because it offers greater dramatic and spectacular opportunities. But of course the author is not admitting this. No, he puts into the mouth of his detective such theories as these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus Dupin speaks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble, for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution—I mean, for the outre character of its features. The police are confounded by seeming absence of motive; not for the murder itself, but for the atrocity of the murder. They are puzzled, too, by the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention, with the facts that no one was discovered upstairs but the assassinated Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and that there were no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending. The wild disorder of the room; the corpse thrust, with the head downward, up the chimney; the frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady; these considerations, with those just mentioned, and others which I need not mention, have sufficed to paralyze the powers, by putting completely at fault the boasted acumen of the government agents. They have fallen into the gross but common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse. But it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary that reason feels its way, if at all in its search for the true. In investigations such as we are now pursuing, it should not be so much asked 'what has occurred,1 as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before.' In fact, the facility with which I shall arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a far more intricate case than that of the Rue Morgue from which it differs in one important respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is an ordinary although an atrocious instance of crime. There is nothing peculiarly outre about it. You will observe that, for this reason, the mystery has been considered easy, when, for this reason, it should have been considered difficult of solution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes remarks on this matter thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;As a rule,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.—It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;That sounds a little paradoxical.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clew. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult is it to bring it home.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, so fond is Sherlock Holmes of the bizarre that he prefers that characteristic to the more culpable forms of crime. In one of his stories he observes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;So much so,&quot; I remarked, &quot;that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-value-of-the-trivial&quot;&gt;The Value of the Trivial&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the following extract, perhaps because he is in a disputatious mood, he acknowledges a liking for trivial and lowly manifestations of his art:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;To the man who loves art for its own sake,&quot; remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, &quot;it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth the in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes celebres and sensational trials in which I have figured, but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;And yet,&quot; said I, smiling &quot;I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You have erred, perhaps,&quot; he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs, and lighting with it the long cherrywood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood—&quot;you have erred perhaps in attempting to put color and life into each of your statements, instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,&quot; I remarked, with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No, it is not selfishness or conceit,&quot; said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. &quot;If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Watson himself confesses to the dangers of this literary Scylla and Charybdis with which Conan Doyle has seen fit to disturb him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In glancing over the somewhat incoherent series of Memoirs with which I have endeavored to illustrate a few of the mental peculiarities of my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I have been struck by the difficulty which I have experienced in picking out examples which shall in every way answer my purpose. For in those cases in which Holmes has performed some tour de force of analytical reasoning, and has demonstrated the value of his peculiar methods of investigation, the facts themselves have often been so slight or so commonplace that I could not feel justified in laying them before the public. On the other hand, it has frequently happened that he has been concerned in some research where the facts have been of the most remarkable and dramatic character, but where the share which he has himself taken in determining their causes has been less pronounced than I, as his biographer, could wish. The small matter which I have chronicled under the heading of 'A Study in Scarlet,1 and that other later one connected with the loss of the Gloria Scott, may serve as examples of this Scylla and Charybdis which are forever threatening the historian. It may be that in the business of which I am now about to write the part which my friend played is not sufficiently accentuated; and yet the whole train of circumstances is so remarkable that I cannot bring myself to omit it entirely from this series.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-tricks-of-imitation&quot;&gt;The Tricks of Imitation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tricks of the trade are of course faithfully copied by the imitators and successors of these great authors. An example in point is this from Jacques Futrelle's &quot;The Thinking Machine;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Now, Mr. Hatch,&quot; said The Thinking Machine in his perpetually crabbed voice, &quot;we have a most remarkable riddle. It gains this remarkable aspect from its very simplicity. It is not, however, necessary to go into that now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will make it clear to you when we know the motives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following paragraph of philosophy has proved of immense use as a model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;All this seems strange to you,&quot; continued Holmes, &quot;because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clew which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those outre and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its principles are embodied in this quotation from Gordon Holmes' &quot;A Mysterious Disappearance:&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The greater the apparent mystery,&quot; he communed, &quot;the less it is in reality. We now have two tracks to follow. They are both hidden, it is true, but when we find one, it will probably intersect the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You are not to blame. White,&quot; he said, &quot;for having failed to note many things which I have now told you. You are the slave of a system. Your method works admirably for the detection of commonplace crime, but as soon as the higher region of romance is reached it is as much out of place as a steam-roller in a lady's boudoir. Look at the remarkable series of crimes the English police have failed to solve of late, merely because some bizarre element had intruded itself at the outset. Have you ever read any of the works of Edgar Allan Poe?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detective answered in the affirmative. &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; and &quot;The Mystery of Marie Roget&quot; were familiar to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,&quot; went on Bruce, &quot;there you have the accurate samples of my meaning. Poe would not have been puzzled for an hour by the vagaries of Jack the Ripper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He would have said at once—most certainly after the third or fourth in the series of murders—'This is the work of an athletic lunatic, with a morbid love of anatomy and a morbid hatred of a certain class of women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Seek for him among young men who have pestered doctors with outrageous theories, and who possess weak- minded or imbecile relatives.' Then, again, take the murder on the South-Western Railway. Do you think Poe would have gone questioning bartenders or inquiring into abortive love affairs? Not he! Jealous swains do not carry pistols about with them to slay their sweethearts, nor do they choose a four-minutes' interval between suburban stations for frenzied avowals of their passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here you have the clear trail of a clever lunatic, dropping from the skies, as it were, and disappearing in the same erratic manner.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Master of Mysteries,&quot; Mr. Gelett Burgess puts this principle into the mouth of his psychic detective. Astro:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It will probably be easy and interesting,&quot; he remarked to his assistant Valeska, who had been present at the interview with McGraw. &quot;It is these cases which are apparently so extraordinary that are most easily solved. Given any remarkable variation in the aspect of a crime, and you know immediately where to begin. This will be only play, I fancy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <summary type="html">There is a fascination about the solving of a big murder mystery by a bit of a broken cuff-link; or the tracing of a professional burglar by a speck of cigarette ash. Of course, the philosophy is that these clues are so small as to be unnoticed by the criminal who so conveniently leaves them behind him. Also they are unnoticed by the amateur or the Central Office sleuth, and so redound to the glory of the Transcendent Detective.</summary>

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the many devices introduced by detective writers to arrest and hold the readers' attention, some are admittedly legitimate and used by best authors. Others are unfair; and still others were permissible but have become so hackneyed as to be taboo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;snow-and-rain&quot;&gt;Snow and Rain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Monsieur Lecoq&quot; much depends on the footprints in the snow. Thereafter in the first chapter of nearly every detective story we are informed that &quot;a light snow had fallen the evening before.&quot; Then witnesses are brought to prove the exact hour the snow began to fall, and the moment it stopped. This fixes the time of the murder, and the footprints in the snow lead to or from the criminal as the author may decree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later this light snow was varied by &quot;a gentle rain, the first for two weeks,&quot; that left paths and flower-beds soft for the indicative footprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; there is a torrential downpour. This is in order to soften the clay of the garden path sufficiently to take footmarks; but it is a little overdone, for the torrents pour down all night, and would have obliterated any footprints save those made by a fictive criminal for the benefit of a fictive detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This same rain is treated a little better by Miss Mary E. Wilkins in her story &quot;The Long Arm,11 for she relates &quot;There had been heavy rain in the morning of the 17th, and the soil is a sticky clay. I examined it at daybreak on the morning of the 18th and, as it had not rained during the night the footprints were as fresh as if they had just been made.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the same accurately scheduled, time-lock rain, but it is a little more logical than the cloudburst variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, then, act along without the light snow or the gentle rain or even the torrents. They seem almost indispensable, but endeavor for once to construct a crime without them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;some-particularly-hackneyed-devices&quot;&gt;Some Particularly Hackneyed Devices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fog, though not so much of a factor here, is incessantly used in English detective stories. It is so obviously a convenient device for concealing crime, that it is the foundation of Richard Harding Davis's &quot;In the Fog&quot; and also of &quot;A Mysterious Disappearance,&quot; &quot;Big Bow Mystery,&quot; &quot;The Masquerader,&quot; and scores of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another hackneyed device is the secret panel in the wall, which slides open by pressing a hidden spring. This was overdone in sensational fiction, before Detective Stories began, but was seized upon as a valuable device for Mystery tales. But it is easily suspected, and in unsatisfactory in modern settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid too, if you can, the packet of valuable papers that disclose secret plans of enormous political importance. This has been overdone, and the plot of Conan Doyle's &quot;The Naval Treaty&quot; has been paraphrased and parodied until it has become tiresome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trite incident is the finding of a pistol engraved with initials, near the body of the victim. The youngest reader nowadays, knows better than to suspect the owner of those initials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote from a personal letter of Mr. Burton E. Stevenson:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If I were to find a murdered man,—which the Lord forbid!—and should also discover beside the body a pistol with a name on it or a visiting card or a monogrammed watch charm, or anything else of a clearly identifying character, I should conclude at once that the person thus identified was not guilty. This is a weakness which often annoys me in the modern detective story. When the hero's cane is found in the bushes near the body, and everyone concludes that the hero is therefore guilty, I put the book down with a sigh of disappointment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fine example of this mistaken device is in &quot;The Villa Mystery, &quot; by Herbert Flowerdew:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The old man was staring at him stupidly. Now suddenly his face became alive again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You think that I shot the master?&quot; he whispered incredulously. &quot;I wish to God it was me. Do you know this, Mr. Esmond?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He was taking from his pocket a dainty lace-edged handkerchief, and as he passed it across to the young mean, Esmond recognized the subtle perfume it carried, even before his eyes fell on the embroidered initial, and his face paled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well?&quot; he said hoarsely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mason glanced apprehensively at the door, although it was locked, and dropped his voice to an even lower whisper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It was lying by the side of the master when I found him. That is why I did not send for the police. I wanted to give her time to get away.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The veriest ignoramus in the tricks of Detective Fiction would know better than to suspect the owner of that handkerchief! Again, we find this scene in &quot;The Circular Staircase&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In one of the tulip beds back of the house an early blackbird was pecking viciously at something that glittered in the light. I picked my way gingerly over through the dew and stooped down: almost buried in the soft ground was a revolver! I scraped the earth off it with the tip of my shoe, and, picking it up, slipped it into my pocket. Not until I had got into my bedroom and double-locked the door did I venture to take it out and examine it. One look was all I needed. It was Halsey's revolver! I had unpacked it the day before and put it on his shaving stand, and there could be no mistake. His name was on a small silver plate on the handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I seemed to see a network closing around my boy, innocent as I knew he was. The revolver—I am afraid of them, but anxiety gave me courage to look through the barrel—the revolver had still two bullets in it. I could only breathe a prayer of thankfulness that I had found the revolver before any sharp-eyed detective had come around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I decided to keep what clues I had, the cuff-link, the golf- stick and the revolver, in a secure place until I could see some reason for displaying them. The cuff-link had been dropped into a little filigree box on my toilet table. I opened the box and felt around for it. The box was empty—the cuff-link had disappeared!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuff-links, or other small articles kept for clues, invariably disappear in Detective Stories, and many authors seek to mislead by such devices, but the trained reader is not to be fooled by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omit the use of a magpie, raven or parrot as an instrument for stealing jewels. A bird of this sort made an effective criminal when &quot;The Jackdaw of Rheims&quot; was written; but, though still a plausible one, the poor bird has been overworked and deserves a rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And oh, young writer, avoid, as you would the plague, the introduction of shreds or threads of wearing apparel as incriminating evidence! Probably this began with Lecoq's discovery of a few threads of brown wool, which were tom off by splinters, as a man wiped snow from a beam with his coat sleeve. This was credible and even plausible, and as it was the first time such a device had appeared in detective fiction it was acceptable. But how that poor detail has been abused and tortured ever since!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;devices-which-are-not-plausible&quot;&gt;Devices Which Are Not Plausible&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Accomplice,&quot; an unusually good court-room story, by Frederick Trevor Hill, we have this sort of evidence reduced almost to an absurdity. To quote from page 13:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The first error consisted in leaving the drippings of candle-grease on the veranda roof, and the second was in kneeling on those drippings before they were quite dry. As though it had been a hand gripping the skirt of the criminal, that wax held in its clutch, half a dozen threads of a hairy cloth, blue in color, and of a texture known to the trade as dress goods. When you have found the wearer of the cloth from which those threads were torn, gentlemen, you will have found the murderer of Mr. Gregory Shaw.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the book it was revealed that sure enough the criminal, who, however, was a man instead of the young woman at first suspected, had knelt in the candle drippings, and had left there bits of blue wool shreds from his trouser knees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can scarcely imagine a candle-dripping sufficiently tenacious to grasp in its clutch and hold for evidence a portion of material necessarily drawn tightly over the bent knees of the criminal. Even granting the especially hairy cloth from which the murderer obligingly had his costume made for the occasion, candle-grease of any sort does not possess such strongly adherent, not to say bull-dog, qualities as would allow it to clutch and keep pieces of that cloth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jacques Futrelle uses the thread clue with a little more plausibility, though still slightly forced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Thinking Machine opened his pocketbook and took from it the scarlet thread which he had picked from the rope of the flagpole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Here, I believe, is the real clue to the problem,&quot; he explained to Hatch. &quot;What does it seem to be?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hatch examined it closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I should say a strand from a Turkish bath robe,&quot; was his final judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Possibly. Ask some cloth expert what he makes of it, then if it sounds promising look into it. Find out if by any possibility it can be any part of any garment worn by any person in the apartment house.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;But, it's so slight        &quot; Hatch began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I know,&quot; the other interrupted, tartly. &quot;It's slight, but I believe it is a part of the wearing apparel of the person, man or woman, who has four times attempted to kill Mr. Henley and who did kill the girl. Therefore it is important.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this thread led to the capture of the criminal, and as it was found caught in a rope near the scene of the crime it was a fairly good clue; but as a matter of fact, the threads of Turkish toweling are of fairly stout calibre, and are not likely to be broken off as they trail across a rope. So much depends on the plausibility of these clues, that not only care but common sense must be exercised in their selection. In the Thinking Machine story, another scarlet thread from the same bath-robe attached itself importantly and conspicuously to a metal corner of a trunk, and so by the trail of red threads the criminal was hunted down. Here again we see the beautiful workings of the salted mine. In real life those tell-tale threads would have stayed stubbornly in their own warp or woof; or if they did leave their rightful abiding place they would creep behind the bureau or somehow get into the dust bin undiscovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Samuel Gardenhire's story, &quot;The Abduction of Mary Ellis,&quot; the discovery of the criminal hinges on a piece of brown wrapping-paper, on which the kidnappers wrote an advertisement asking for ransom. This paper, after passing through several hands, was examined microscopically by the Transcendent Detective, and he discovered wax and a strand or two of floss doll's hair. Now, think of the thousands of dolls that are bought and never leave a hair of their heads fastened by a bit of their own wax face to their wrapping paper! and then think of this doll intelligently leaving these traces at the critical juncture, where such a clue was necessary, and then judge for yourself the relationship between truth and fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This habit of using shredded evidence is not confined to writers in our own language. An exceedingly good detective story is by a Russian, Anton Chekhov, and is called the &quot;Safety Match.&quot; There was a bushy burdock growing under the window, which was greatly trampled. On its upper branches. Detective Dukovski succeeded in finding some fine hairs of dark blue wool. Now, had the bushy burdock pulled out a jagged piece of woolen cloth we might have forgiven it, but to catch and hold up for inspection a few fine hairs is drawing too long a bow. However, they cut off these twigs of burdock and care fully wrapped them in paper in true conventional style. These few fine hairs lead directly to the trousers of the murderer and the naive author quite calmly acknowledges his debt to an illustrious predecessor: &quot;See what a fellow who has read Gaboriau can do!&quot; he exclaimed, which is not too self-depreciatory, for even in the same story he has adapted to his own use many more of Lecoq's devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most logical and plausible instance of detection by the means of tiny threads for clues is found in Mary E. Wilkins's &quot;The Long Arm.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I began to-day at the bottom—that is, with the room least likely to contain any clue, the parlour. I took a chalk-line and a yard-stick, and divided the floor into square yards, and every one of these squares I examined on my hands and knees. I found in this way literally nothing on the carpet but dust, lint, two common white pins, and three inches of blue sewing silk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;At last I got the dustpan and brush, and yard by yard swept the floor. I took the sweepings in a white pasteboard box out into the yard in the strong sunlight, and examined them. There was nothing but dust and lint and five inches of brown woollen thread—evidently a ravelling of some dress material. The blue silk and the brown thread are the only possible clues which I found today and they are hardly possible. Rufus's wife can probably account for them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two threads were very naturally dropped from the clothing of a dressmaker, who has a perfect right to shed her snippings and ravelings wherever she may list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is wise to be careful in the use of shreds and threads that the author may not bring a smile to the face of the &quot;gentle reader.&quot; Think of the absurdity of this statement, quoted from a modern English story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It all began with the murder of Mr. Andrew Carrthwaite, at Palermo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He had been found dead in the garden of his villa just outside the town, with a stiletto between his shoulder blades and a piece of rough Irish tweed, obviously torn from his assailant's coat, clutched tightly in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to see a hand that could tear a piece out of a coat of rough Irish tweed! The strength of such a clutch would put to blush the feats of the Murderer of the Rue Morgue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-coroner&quot;&gt;The Coroner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of a murder, the Inquest should follow, as the night the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Scales of Justice&quot; is a book which, aside from its very clever pages, has most interesting and enlightening aphorisms at the head of its chapters. One of these tells us &quot;When evolution has produced a perfect thing, it stops working. Crowner's quest law has not changed in three centuries.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by way of a fleer at the Coroner's Inquest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another current authority says, &quot;Mr. Coroner has been losing his importance so rapidly that not long ago it was seriously proposed to do away with him and his utterly useless performances. However, he is still in power, but it is a very much shorn power nowadays.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Arthur C. Train refers to this subject in stronger terms. &quot;The coroner,&quot; says he, &quot;is at best no more than an appendix to the legal anatomy, and frequently he is a disease. The spectacle of a medical man of small learning and less English trying to preside over a court of first instance is enough to make the accused himself chuckle for joy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This argues a good sense of humor on the part of the accused, but Mr. Train must know whereof he speaks. But be that as it may, the Coroner has not yet been ousted from his position in detective fiction, and is too picturesque a figure to fear imminent dethronement. On the contrary, this official gives opportunity for what is known as a character sketch, and is often described as if with the author's keen relish for satire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance this description is quoted from &quot;The Scales of Justice,&quot; by George L. Knapp:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coroner Lutgers was the sort of doctor who gets a political job or goes to advertising within three years of his graduation. In one capacity or another, he had been drawing public money for twenty years; and meant to continue in the same occupation for twenty years more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His strong point was dignity, a dignity much resembling a safety night lamp; for no matter how often it was tipped over, it always righted itself, to gleam austerely from the doctor's bald forehead and patriarchal whiskers. At this particular inquest, the doctor's dignity lacked something of its usual calm. It was not a case in which the public would willingly accept the &quot;person or persons unknown&quot; verdict; and yet for the life of him, the coroner could not see how any other verdict was possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we still cling to the coroner as a necessary and desirable member of our detective fiction family, and we feel that we could better spare a better man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-inquest&quot;&gt;The Inquest&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inquest in detective fiction, came in with &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue,&quot; where it is used as a vehicle for telling much of the story. Since then, the inquest has been a prominent incident in most of the murder stories of detective fiction; and as it can be made to present all manner of thrilling and exciting scenes, and also as it is most useful in leading or misleading the reader, it will probably remain with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a short-story, the inquest is seldom if ever described in detail, because of lack of space. But in a full book the inquest provides several chapters of interesting and instructive reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe, ruled as ever by his exact economy of attention, and moreover, because his story is a short one after all, gives merely the gist of the inquest; listing the witnesses in descriptive fashion and tersely reporting their depositions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I. Zangwill, in &quot;The Big Bow Mystery,&quot; takes advantage of his inquest scene to indulge in sarcastic humor and veiled innuendos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Katharine Green is conscientious and straightforward in her inquest recitals; while the earlier French authors are diffuse and elaborate in their descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken by and large, the inquest is invaluable to the Detective Story writer. It affords such necessary opportunities for cataloging details without seeming to do so; for convincing the reader that the innocent are the criminals; for introducing and characterizing the actors; and for setting the stage with the necessary properties for the future scenes of the drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-witnesses&quot;&gt;The Witnesses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal element of the inquest is, of course, the witnesses and their testimony. Few realize that the nursery tale of Cock Robin partakes of the nature of an inquest. In the first line, &quot;Who killed Cock Robin?&quot; we are informed as to the crime and the victim. This is immediately followed by the complete confession of the criminal and the disclosure of the weapon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I,&quot; said the sparrow,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;With my bow and arrow;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I killed Cock Robin&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a frank enough confession, and doubtless true; but even a confession must have corroborative witness, and, an eye witness, if possible. Hence we read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Who saw him die?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I,&quot; said the fly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;With my little eye,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I saw him die.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this investigation, this testimony of an eye witness, presented in an entertaining manner, is the reason for the introduction of the inquest in our story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The witnesses are naturally the characters of the book. The jurymen are but transients, and are not heard of again after their verdict is rendered. But the witnesses comprise the chief movers of the machinery and it is in their power to make or mar the plot. For if the plot of a detective story is the knot and its unraveling, the evidence of the witnesses constitutes the strands of the skein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot is the skeleton, but the evidence and the deductions therefrom are the muscle and sinew. On the value and presentation of the evidence does the reader's interest depend. No matter how absorbing the puzzle, if the evidence and deduction be not full of action and surprise the story palls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;presentation-of-the-evidence&quot;&gt;Presentation of the Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed it is the chain of evidences, all more or less surprising, that holds the reader's interest through the five hundred pages of &quot;The Moonstone,&quot; where the puzzle is only a jewel robbery. And here is one reason why real murder trials are not as interesting as fictional ones. For the newspaper reports are plain accounts of the evidence found, whether entertaining or not; but the wily detective author need introduce no evidence that is not picturesque or exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author should know exhaustively the truth about evidence, its real value and meaning; and knowing this, utilize such knowledge at will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn too, the difference between vital and incidental evidence. Sherlock Holmes remarks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is of the highest importance in the art of detection to be able to recognize, out of a number of facts, which are incidental and which vital. Otherwise your energy and attention must be dissipated instead of being concentrated. Now, in this case there was not the slightest doubt in my mind from the first that the key of the whole matter must he looked for in the scrap of paper in the dead man's hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course; since the scrap of paper was put there by the author for that very purpose. But a close study of Conan Doyle's stories will prove the best lesson in collating and understanding evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;circumstantial-evidence&quot;&gt;Circumstantial Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn, too, the difference between circumstantial evidence and the testimony of an eye witness. Remember, circumstantial evidence must be strong and well attested to convict a murderer. Remember, too, how rarely it is the case that a murderer allows an audience when he commits his crime. Learn to adjust for yourself the harmonization of these statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is reduced to an absurdity in Melville D. Post's story, &quot;The Corpus Delicti.&quot; In this story an atrocious murder is committed, but with diabolical cleverness the criminal utterly destroys the body of his victim by the use of chemicals. When the trial is on, and overwhelming circumstantial evidence proves the crime, the counsel for the prosecution says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Men may lie, but circumstances cannot. The thousand hopes and fears and passions of men may delude, or bias the witness. Yet it is beyond the human mind to conceive that a clear, complete chain of concatenated circumstances can be in error. Hence it is that the greatest jurists have declared that such evidence, being rarely liable to delusion or fraud, is safest and most powerful. The machinery of human justice cannot guard against the remote and improbable doubt. The inference is persistent in the affairs of men. It is the only means by which the human mind reaches the truth. If you forbid the jury to exercise it, you bid them work after first striking off their hands. Rule out the irresistible inference, and the end of justice is come in this land; and you may as well leave the spider to weave his web through the abandoned court room.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is rational and straightforward, but the counsel for the defence reports:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I care not if the circumstantial evidence in this case were so strong and irresistible as to be overpowering; if the judge on the bench, if the jury, if every man within sound of my voice, were convinced of the guilt of the prisoner to the degree of certainty that is absolute; if the circumstantial evidence left in the mind no shadow of the remotest improbable doubt; yet, in the absence of the eyewitness, this prisoner cannot be punished, and this Court must compel the jury to acquit him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is unanswerable and after much hesitation the judge spoke thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In this case the body has not been found and there is no direct proof of criminal agency on the part of the prisoner, although the chain of circumstantial evidence is complete and irresistible in the highest degree. Nevertheless, it is all circumstantial evidence, and under the laws of New York the prisoner cannot be punished. I have no right of discretion. The law does not permit a conviction in this case, although every one of us may be morally certain of the prisoner's guilt. I am, therefore, gentlemen of the jury, compelled to direct you to find the prisoner not guilty.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an erratic plot, but founded on absolute knowledge of the law, and resulting in a most picturesque use of circumstantial evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this connection we might refer to a speech of Jacques Futrelle's hero detective who thus delivers himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Circumstantial fiddlesticks!&quot; snapped The Thinking Machine. &quot;I wouldn't convict a yellow dog of stealing jam on circumstantial evidence alone, even if he had jam all over his nose.&quot; He squinted truculently at Hatch for a moment. &quot;In the first place, well-behaved dogs don't eat jam,&quot; he added more mildly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, most detective stories are simply the case of the dog with the jam on his nose and the plot is mostly concerned with proving that that particular dog is not the criminal after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;deductions-from-evidence&quot;&gt;Deductions from Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence, whether at the inquest or at a trial, must be carefully chosen, not only for its own attractive or surprising character but with a view to its material for deduction and analysis. A burnt match on the stairs of an elevated railroad station offers the casual observer little clue; but a burnt match of a particular style, on those same stairs, proving the hour when the criminal lit his &quot;big black cigar,&quot; is of immense importance in leading to a conclusion, foregone in the author's mind but not in the reader's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, it is re-solution that counts. The interest depends on the fact of that match being a beacon light and proving its illuminative power as the tale goes on. No burnt match has a right to be in a detective story unless it is a lamp to the feet of the detective; and a light to a path, either right or wrong, but intentionally so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though circumstantial evidence may depend on personal testimony, it is oftener deduction from inanimate clues, preferably small ones, but always unexpected or incongruous ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the &quot;Astro&quot; stories, the reader's interest is at once aroused by an unknown baby found in the street playing with a priceless fire opal and a black dead hand. Had the child held a rattle and a doll no curiosity would be felt as to the situation. This, of course, goes back to the accepted principle of the value of the bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;deductions-from-clues&quot;&gt;Deductions from Clues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even more advantageous than this is the use of the infinitesimal clue. When not irrationally lugged in, shreds, ravel- ings, scrapings of dust from boot heels, or scraps of paper are all much prized as fictional evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the best recent Detective Stories a red shoe button figures as the clue to a murderer. In one of Ottolengui's stories a waistcoat button is the clue. Of course buttons are a favorite clue as they can conveniently drop off and stay behind on the scene of the crime; or can even be pulled off the criminal's clothing by the frantic clutch of the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A story by Melville D. Post, entitled &quot;The Missing Link,&quot; hinges upon the loss of a cuff link. But this particular clue is rather hackneyed, and it even cropped up again in &quot;The Trevor Case,&quot; a very popular recent novel; and also plays its part in &quot;The Circular Staircase.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great Sergeant Cuff, in &quot;The Moonstone,&quot; first describes the value of a tiny clue by way of instructing his reader; and then goes on to work up a small smear on a freshly painted door into a clue of immense importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Silent Bullet&quot; the clue is so minute as to require a very powerful microscope to discern it. The paragraph quoted below describes the impression of the threads of woven material on a leaden bullet; which, though scientifically possible, is certainly a novel and ingenious bit of evidence for a Detective Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Every leaden bullet, as I have said, which has struck such fabric bears an impression of the threads which is recognizable even when the bullet has penetrated deeply into the body. It is only obliterated partially or entirely when the bullet has been flattened by striking a bone or other hard object. Even then, as in this case, if only a part of the bullet is flattened the remainder may still show the marks of the fabric. A heavy warp, say of cotton velvet or, as I have here, homespun, will be imprinted well on the bullet, but even a fine batiste, containing one hundred threads to the inch, will show marks. Even layers of goods such as a coat, shirt, and undershirt may each leave their marks, but that does not concern us in this case. Now I have here a piece of pongee silk, cut from a woman's automobile-coat. I discharge the bullet through it—so. I compare the bullet now with the others and with the one probed from the neck of Mr. Parker. I find that the marks on the fatal bullet correspond precisely with those on the bullet fired through the pongee coat.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the Sherlock Holmes stories depend on the deductions from tiny clues, so finely drawn as to be sometimes a strain on the reader's credulity; but the credulity of the experienced reader of detective fiction becomes exceedingly agile; and he can believe any number of impossible things from before breakfast until long after midnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this use of tiny clues is the direct result of the principle of microscopic observation, and it is inseparable from the work of the Transcendent Detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;That Affair Next Door,&quot; the astute Miss Butterworth finds for a clue a small black pin: &quot;A small matter,&quot; she declares to the reader, &quot;but it points in the right direction.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a story of Ashton-Kirk, the clue is the tiny, but symmetrically-shaped bit of pasteboard punched from a railroad ticket. Indeed, all Detective Stories fairly bristle with these tiny clues. But there are plenty yet unused. The alert Detective Story writer can find many that will serve his purpose. A single shred of excelsior found on the floor of a room, where no carefully packed bit of china or bric-a-brac has been unwrapped, will prove the presence of the only man under suspicion who received such a box by recent parcel delivery. Or a tiny, shiny spangle may lead as unerringly to a certain evening gown of a certain grande dame, as a grain of rice in a hat brim proves a bride, or straws in the hair, a farmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these things must have some sort of a subtly indicative interest. Nobody wants to read of a dead leaf fallen from a tree, merely to prove that it is autumn. And so it is the author's work to provide clues that lead to something, and that pique the reader into endeavoring to find out for himself what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;evidence-by-applied-psychology&quot;&gt;Evidence by Applied Psychology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new kind of evidence has appeared of late in Detective Stories that is not deduced from an inanimate clue or voluntarily spoken by a witness. It is the scientific procedure known as applied psychology. It necessitates apparatus with such impressive names as kymographs and tachistoscopes and ergographs; and it may be learned in its general plan from Professor Miinsterberg's book, &quot;On the Witness Stand.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This science aims to assist and serve such fields of practical life as education, medicine, art, economics and law. But the book in question considers only problems in which psychology and law come in contact. They deal essentially with the mind of the witness on the witness stand and their purpose is to turn the attention of serious men to this science. The detective writer who wishes to make a point of the credibility of testimony of witnesses cannot do better than to make a close study of the principles set forth in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;direct-observation&quot;&gt;Direct Observation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, the inquest or trial scene in detective fiction makes a great point of the testimony of eye witnesses. Yet really the utter unreliability of eye witnesses has often been remarked upon; and Hawthorne, in his &quot;Note-Book,&quot; says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Every day of my life makes me feel more and more how seldom a fact is accurately stated; how, almost invariably, when a story has passed through the mind of a third person it becomes, so far as regards the impression that it makes in further repetitions, little better than a falsehood, and this, too, though the narrator be the most truth-seeking person in existence. How marvelous the tendency is. Is truth a fantasy which we are to pursue forever and never grasp?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it is sufficient to pay attention to the conversations in which we take part every day to discover that the worth of evidence depends to a very small degree on the good faith or the moral value of the witness. Who is there who has not seen for himself to what an extent accounts of the same fact may differ, even when related by serious witnesses endeavouring to keep scrupulously to the truth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing, indeed, is more difficult than to tell the truth; that is to say, to recount the past, to make a deposition upon some fact, even if the fact be one which has come a great number of times under our own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prove that this is so, let the reader make the following simple experiment. Without any preliminary, ask a number of persons kindly to draw from memory the figure which indicates six o'clock, exactly as it appears on the dials of their watches. You will find that some of these persons will simply write the figure VI or 6; others, sharper, remembering that the figures take their line of direction from the centre of the dial, will write the symbol upside down, IX or 9. Everybody, however, will be quite convinced that his particular testimony is correct, and ready to swear to it on oath. Now ask them to take out their watches and look at them. Most of them will discover to their stupefaction that the figure VI or IX which they saw so clearly at the foot of the imaginary watch floating before their mind's eye has no existence at all on the dial of the real watch, where its place is taken by the small seconds-hand dial!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, then, we have a great number of inaccurate depositions; and yet, how often in the course of a day do most people look at their watches! There is no doubt, moreover, that all these people whom you have thus proved to be wrong acted in perfect good faith; not one of them had any wilful intention of deceiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, it is not uncommon to find a man who has owned his watch for many years, utterly unable to state whether the hours on the dial are indicated by Roman numerals or Arabic figures. This means only lack of observation, but quite as common is mistaken observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An amusing practical test of this is thus related of Professor Dueck. In order to test the memory and susceptibility to suggestion of his pupils he performed the following experiment on forty-eight boys between the ages of fourteen and seventeen. He passed a silver coin about the size of a fifty-cent piece around the class, instructing each boy to examine it carefully, but giving no further indications as to the purpose of his action. At the end of the lesson, which in other respects proceeded as usual. Professor Dueck, having again taken possession of the coin, addressed the class as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You have no doubt observed that the coin which I handed around had a hole in it; now I should like to test your powers of observation. I am, therefore, going to ask each of you to indicate the point on the coin where the hole is found. Just take a piece of paper, draw a circle upon it, and indicate roughly the position of the head on the coin and of the hole which you observed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact there was no hole in the coin at all. Nevertheless no fewer than forty-four out of the forty-eight pupils indicated the position of the alleged hole in the coin, some even indicating the position of two holes. Of the four remaining pupils, only one positively asserted that there was no hole in the coin, the other three merely said that they had not observed the hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This alone is interesting enough, but there were several other features in the case which are well worth recording. In the first place the one and only individual who had not been open to suggestion was a boy who had previously shown his independence by giving considerable difficulty in matters of discipline. Furthermore, several of the younger boys, even after they were told that there was no hole in the coin, absolutely refused to admit this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scientific American, commenting upon this experiment, remarks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It hardly needs to be pointed out how significant an observation of this character is in its bearing on legal testimony. We must not be surprised that the witness may under certain circumstances not merely make a certain statement incompatible with facts, but may even insist in his erroneous belief in the face of overwhelming evidence against it—and all this in perfectly good faith.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an observer of a magnificent military parade noted the exact and well-trained marching of the soldiers; and in describing it afterward, said positively, &quot;And every man was exactly the same height.&quot; Which was far from being true, as the soldiers were of varying heights, but the strong impressions of harmony and precision, had given an unconscious effect of uniformity of height. All of which goes to prove that with the best intentions in the world, false testimony may be given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further than this, if desired, false testimony may be induced by suggestion of the questioner. Indeed in the giving of evidence suggestion plays a most important part. The simple fact of questioning a witness, of pressing him to answer, enormously increases the risk of errors in his evidence. The form of the question also influences the value of the reply that is made to it. This has given rise to the well-known prohibition of &quot;leading questions&quot; in courts of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us suppose, for instance; that some persons are questioned about the colour of a certain dog. The replies are likely to be much more correct if we ask the witnesses, &quot;What is the colour of the dog?&quot; than if we were to say to them, &quot;Was the dog white, or was it brown?&quot; The question will be positively suggestive if we ask, &quot;Was the dog white?&quot; To such a question the answer is probably of no value. In questioning witnesses—that is to say, in pressing them and forcing their memory—we may obtain, it is true, a much more extensive deposition than if we leave them free to answer spontaneously. Any advantage thus obtained, however, is problematical, since we lose in fidelity whatever we may gain in extent of information. A trained observation takes things in at a glance, and correctly, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M. Robert Houdin gives this interesting description of training his own eye, as quoted in &quot;The Lock and Key Library:&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;My son and I passed rapidly before a toy-shop, or any other displaying a variety of wares, and cast an attentive glance upon it. A few steps farther on we drew pencil and paper from our pockets, and tried which could describe the greater number of objects seen in passing. I must own that my son reached a perfection far greater than mine, for he could often write down forty objects, while I could scarce reach thirty. Often feeling vexed at this defeat, I would return to the shop and verify his statement, but he rarely made a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;My male readers will certainly understand the possibility of this, but they will recognize the difficulty. As for my lady readers, I am convinced beforehand they will not be of the same opinion, for they daily perform far more astounding feats. Thus, for instance, I can safely assert that a lady seeing another pass at full speed in a carriage, will have had time to analyze her toilet from her bonnet to her shoes, and be able to describe not only the fashion and quality of the stuffs, but also say if the lace be real or only machine made. I have known ladies to do this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zangwill in &quot;Big Bow Mystery&quot; thus argues the worthlessness of most casual observation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Sir, everything depends on our getting down to the root of the matter. What percentage of average evidence should you think is thorough, plain, simple, unvarnished fact, 'the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Fifty?&quot; said the Minister, humoring him a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Not five. I say nothing of lapses of memory, or inborn defects of observational power—though in the suspiciously precise recollection of dates and events possessed by ordinary witnesses in important trials taking place years after the occurrences involved, is one of the most amazing things in the curiosities of modern jurisprudence. I defy you, sir, to tell me what you had for dinner last Monday or w hat exactly you were saying and doing at five o'clock last Tuesday afternoon. Nobody whose life does not run in mechanical grooves can do anything of the sort; unless, of course, the facts have been very impressive. But this by the way. The great obstacle to veracious observation is the element of prepossession in all vision. Has it ever struck you, sir, that we never see anyone more than once if that? The first time we meet a man we may possibly see him as he is; the second time our vision is colored and modified by the memory of the first. Do our friends appear to us as they appear to strangers? Do our rooms, our furniture, our pipes strike our eye as they would strike the eye of an outsider, looking on them for the first time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Can a mother see her baby's ugliness, or a lover his mistress' shortcomings though they stare everybody else in the face? Can we see ourselves as others see us? No; habit, prepossession changes all. The mind is a large factor of every so-called external fact. The eye sees, sometimes, what it wishes to see, more often what it expects to see. You follow me, sir?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;exactness-of-detail&quot;&gt;Exactness of Detail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this connection we are not discussing the value of evidence, per se, but merely for what it is worth in the construction of a Detective Story. The bringing forth of false evidence to complicate the mysteries of the story, is entirely permissible, if fairly done. And to do this fairly and properly it is wise to make a study of evidence and its relative value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, the average citizen is not observant. He rarely could tell the details of an incident he has witnessed, unless he were already familiar with the conditions. There fore the author of a worth-while Detective Story must make it his business to familiarize himself perfectly and accurately with the conditions he is describing. A lack of this familiarity with details is often seen in our best artists who portray scenes of whose especial characteristics they are carelessly unobservant. An amusing instance of this sort is remarked in this letter, which appeared in one of our popular periodicals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;DEAR SIR:—Your &quot;Ministers' Number&quot; has just come to hand. I assume that some degree of accuracy is desirable even in a cartoon. Most of the clergy at whom your shafts of wit are aimed seem to be of the Episcopal Church, and I guess we can stand it, but what hurts is the vesture in which you attempt to garb us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For instance, &quot;Charley, the Assistant Minister at St. Joseph's&quot;—and by the way $1,200 is a large salary for Charley; from his looks I should not say he was worth as much as that, at least he would not be as assistant to me—is dressed in a long old-fashioned surplice with bishop sleeves. Young assistants sometimes have Episcopal bees in their bonnets, but never Episcopal sleeves in their surplices. Again, Charley has around his neck what appears to be a feather boa or a tippet. Twelve hundred dollars would not allow him to sport such luxury. Lastly, Charley, who is apparently meant to be a very high churchman, at least he looks like it, is wearing Geneva bands! What a combination! A long surplice with bishop sleeves, fur collar, and Geneva bands is not to be found in the heavens above or the earth beneath—it might be in the other place, but I have my doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If any of your artists ever went to church for any purpose—incidentally it might benefit them and raise the moral tone of the paper!—they would see what kind of garments a minister does wear, and their fun would have added force and pungency, I think. I am sure LIFE always wants to be correct, even in its humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What I have said about Mr. Walker's little picture applies with equal force to Mr. Flagg's extraordinarily vested parson. Really, to what church does he belong? They say we Episcopalians never disturb the peace. Can it be that Mr. Flagg has the idea that Presbyterians, with their strenuous views on predestination and the election, are vested that way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Very sincerely yours,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;theories-of-evidence&quot;&gt;Theories of Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is necessary, then, for an artist to attend carefully to the costuming of his models, how much more necessary is it for the writer of a Detective Story to be carefully accurate even to the tiniest detail of his work. And as evidence is part and parcel of every Detective Story, let the earnest young writer make a close study of it from the best examples in literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read Poe; &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; is all evidence. Read Gaboriau; he understood the fine points of testimony. Read Conan Doyle. Read Anna Katharine Green. And then compare and connote and contrast their presentation and treatment of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This subject is well summed up in the following quotation from &quot;The Man in the Corner,&quot; in which the author both entertains and instructs us with his theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;But supposing it were of paramount importance that you should give an accurate description of a man who sat next to you for half an hour to-day, how would you proceed?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I should say that he was of medium height        &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Five foot eight, nine, or ten?&quot; he interrupted quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;How can one tell to an inch or two?&quot; rejoined Polly, crossly. &quot;He was between colours.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What's that?&quot; he inquired blandly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Neither fair nor dark—his nose—&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, what was his nose like? Will you sketch it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I am not an artist. His nose was fairly straight—his eyes—&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Were neither dark nor light—his hair had the same striking peculiarity—he was neither short nor tall—his nose was neither aquiline nor snub—&quot; he recapitulated, sarcastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No,&quot; she retorted; &quot;he was just ordinary looking.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Would you know him again—say tomorrow, and among a number of other men who were 'neither tall nor short, dark nor fair, aquiline nor snub-nosed,' etc.?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't know—I might—he was certainly not striking enough to be specially remembered.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Exactly/1 he said, while he leant forward excitedly, for all the world like a Jack-in-the-box let loose. &quot;Precisely; and you are a journalist call yourself one, at least—and it should be part of your business to notice and describe people. I don't mean only the wonderful personage with the clear Saxon features, the fine blue eyes, the noble brow and classic face, but the ordinary person—the person who represents ninety out of every hundred of his own kind—the average Englishman, say of the middle classes, who is neither very tall nor very short, who wears a moustache which is neither fair nor dark, but which masks his mouth, and a top hat which hides the shape of his head and brow, a man in fact, who dresses like hundreds of his fellow-creatures, moves like them, speaks like them, has no peculiarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Try to describe him, to recognize him, say a week hence, among his other eighty-nine doubles; worse still, to swear his life away, if he happened to be implicated in some crime, wherein your recognition of him would place the halter round his neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Try that, I say, and having utterly failed you will more readily understand how one of the greatest scoundrels unhung is still at large, and why the mystery on the Underground Railway was never cleared up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two paragraphs from &quot;The Whispering Man&quot; give another twist to the theory of evidence, and whether absolutely true or not, it is interesting and convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jeffrey caught the word out of my mouth. &quot;Evidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There was evidence against every single innocent person in this case—Pomeroy, Armstrong, Gwendolen Carr. The only person against whom there wasn't any was the guilty man himself. No, evidence doesn't amount to much until it's tied on behind the right guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What does the best evidence in the world amount to, anyway, when it comes to that?&quot; he concluded. &quot;It's utterly meaningless, except when it's tied on behind some theory, like the tail on a kite. As for expert testimony, there's only one kind of true expert, and he's just an inspired guesser, no more, no less.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A contrast or discussion of the merits of circumstantial evidence and the testimony of an eye witness is always provocative of interest. Though like many other discussions it is really futile, it carries a certain weight if cleverly set down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes thus remarks upon it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I could hardly imagine a more damning case,&quot; I remarked. &quot;If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,&quot; answered Holmes, thoughtfully. &quot;It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And seemingly opposed to this, is the opinion of the great detective John W. Murray, who says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I believe in circumstantial evidence. I have found it surer than direct evidence in many, many cases. Where circumstantial evidence and direct evidence unite, of course, the result is most satisfactory. There are those who say that circumstances may combine in a false conclusion. This is far less apt to occur than the falsity of direct evidence given by a witness who lies point blank, and who cannot be contradicted save by a judgment of his falsity through the manner of his lying. Few people are good liars. Many of them make their lies too probable; they outdo truth itself. To detect a liar is a great gift. It is a greater gift to detect the lie. I have known instances where, by good fortune, I detected the liar then the lie, and learned the whole truth simply by listening to the lie, and thereby judging the truth. There is no hard and fast rule for this detection. The ability to do it rests with the man. It is largely a matter of instinct.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Mary E. Wilkins in &quot;The Long Arm&quot; voices the same theory with equal cleverness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Crime detection is not a secret art; anybody can do it if he has the writs and the time, and patience to get at all the facts, and if he knows enough of the ways of men and women. It sounds like boasting to say so much, but it isn't; we all fail too often to be vain, and when I fail, I always say, 'I couldn't get at all the facts,' or, 'I didn't know enough about the sort of people concerned.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zangwill, too, states these principles clearly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Pray do not consider me impertinent, but have you ever given any attention to the science of evidence?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;How do you mean?&quot; asked the Home Secretary, rather puzzled, adding with a melancholy smile, &quot;I have had to lately. Of course. I've never been a criminal lawyer, like some of my predecessors. But I should hardly speak of it as a science; I look upon it as a question of common- sense.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Pardon me, sir. It is the most subtle and difficult of all the sciences. It is, indeed, rather the science of the sciences. What is the whole of Inductive logic, as laid down, say, by Bacon and Mill, but an attempt to appraise the value of evidence, the said evidence being the trails left by the Creator, so to speak? The Creator has—I say it in all reverence drawn a myriad red herrings across the track, but the true scientist refuses to be baffled by superficial appearances in detecting the secrets of Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The vulgar herd catches at the gross apparent fact, but the man of insight knows that what lies on the surface does lie.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, realizing the importance of the presentation of evidence as one of the prime factors in our work, let us endeavor to gain a working comprehension of the subject and use it with discrimination and discernment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several false notions which have been so often exploited as to command belief, the young writer should strive to correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-trace-fallacy&quot;&gt;The &quot;Trace&quot; Fallacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hackneyed statement, though of great value to a fiction detective, is far from being true. This is the assertion that it is impossible for a human being to go into a room for any purpose and out again without leaving trace of his presence. Sherlock Holmes insists on this, and says, on one occasion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;My good Hopkins, I have investigated many crimes, but I have never yet seen one which was committed by a flying creature. As long as the criminal remains upon two legs so long must there be some indentation, some abrasion, some trifling displacement which can be detected by the scientific searcher. It is incredible that this blood- bespattered room contained no trace which could have aided us. I understand, however, from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to overlook?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Mary E. Wilkins in her fine detective story, &quot;The Long Arm,&quot; makes the same impressive statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I have a theory that it is impossible for any human being to enter any house, and commit in it a deed of this kind, and not leave behind traces which are the known quantities in an algebraic equation to those who can use them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninety-nine times out of a hundred any one can go into a room, stay for a time and come out again, and leave absolutely no trace of his presence there. A practical test, or a series of them will convince anyone of this. Let your criminal or your innocent suspect leave as many traces and clues as you will, but don't allow your detective to assert that this is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-destruction-of-evidence&quot;&gt;The Destruction of Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another useful but false notion is the great difficulty that the criminal experiences in getting rid of his blood-stained garments or other incriminating impedimenta. If he endeavors to burn them, or throw them in the river or ashbarrel, they come back with feline certainty. Now it is not so difficult to destroy or conceal material successfully, and al that is necessary in this regard is to make the proceedings of your criminal natural and not forced. But let the destruction or concealment be done with common sense, and at least an elementary knowledge of your subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most absurd incidents of destruction is the burning of large packets of papers. A case in point is found in &quot;The Adventure of Milverton,&quot; where we are told:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With perfect coolness Holmes slipped across to the safe, filled his two arms with bundles of letters, and poured them all into the fire. Again and again he did it, until the safe was empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Someone turned the handle and beat upon the outside of the door. Holmes looked swiftly round. The letter which had been the messenger of death for Milverton lay, all mottled with his blood, upon the table. Holmes tossed it in among the blazing papers. Then he drew the key from the outer door, passed through after me, and locked it on the outside. &quot;This way, Watson,&quot; said he, &quot;we can scale the garden wall in this direction.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we are told that it was &quot;a good fire&quot; that was burning in the fireplace, nothing short of a crematory furnace could have continued to burn when these letters were thrown upon it. Remember that Holmes &quot;filled his two arms with bundles of letters and poured them all into the fire.&quot; &quot;Again and again he did this,&quot; until he must have had, by a conservative estimate, some hundreds of letters. Anyone who has tried to burn even three or four letters without unfolding their pages knows the result. As a matter of fact, when Holmes departed, leaving those letters lying on the fire, very few of them could have been greatly injured. If papers must be burned, as is sometimes the case, let them be unfolded and each sheet crumpled a little, and then give sufficient time to the operation. If this is not possible, omit the incident. How often a will or a deed has been &quot;tossed into the grate and reduced to ashes at once.&quot; A folded paper of four or five thicknesses obstinately refuses to burn, except around the edges, and these instantaneous holocausts rouse only amusement in the mind of the common-sense reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;false-hypotheses&quot;&gt;False Hypotheses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another entirely false notion is that &quot;Murder will out.&quot; As to the real fact of this matter, Arthur C. Train, in his admirable work, &quot;Courts, Criminals and the Camorra,&quot; asserts that the prisoners tried for murder are only a mere fraction of those who commit the crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the stories of Luther Trant, we are informed &quot;that for ninety-three out of every one hundred homicides no one is ever punished,&quot; and in &quot;The Scales of Justice,&quot; George L. Knapp tells us, &quot;If you'd cut out the proverbs and stick to the evidence, you'd find out that about one murder in six comes to light enough to get the murderer convicted.&quot; Then too, Samuel N. Gardenhire asserts that &quot;thousands of murders are never found out. Given a doctor, a lack of motive and a good chance, and detection may be laughed at.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But though the authors quoted understand this, scores of other Detective Story writers persist in standing by the old adage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again the beliefs that &quot;a murderer is involuntarily drawn back to the scene of his crime,&quot; and that &quot;a murderer can't help talking of his crime to somebody,&quot; are the basis of many false situations. These hypotheses may be used as working arguments, if desired, but should not be quoted as universal laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another false notion inherent in the average citizen is, that a bystander is forbidden by law to touch the body of a murdered man before the arrival of the coroner. There never was any such law, is not now, and probably never will be. The citizen who is of an inquiring turn of mind has a perfect right to examine dead bodies he runs across in the course of his travels, to move the remains and even search the pockets of the deceased, provided, of course, that his motives are honest. That is all that is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;errors-of-fact-and-of-inference&quot;&gt;Errors of Fact and of Inference&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from these false and erroneous notions which are common, let the writer of detective fiction be careful to avoid absolute mistakes, paradoxes, or anachronisms. In this class of story, accuracy and logic are imperative, and nothing can excuse carelessness in descriptive details or sequential happenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our greatest and best writers have been caught napping in this respect, and though we can forgive it when Homer nods, it is not excusable in a tyro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take one of the most flagrant errors, let us look at a page in Poe's &quot;The Mystery of Marie Roget.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the clothing and the condition of the clothing of the drowned girl had been hastily or superficially described, it would not be so surprising. But Poe, with his wonderful &quot;minuteness of detail which does not leave a pin or a button unnoted,&quot; makes this absurd statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The clothing was much torn and otherwise disordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the outer garment, a slit, about a foot wide, had been torn upward from the bottom hem to the waist, but not torn off. It was wound three times around the waist, and secured by a sort of hitch in the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Assuming the young girl to have a waist measure, outside her clothing, of at least twenty inches, simple arithmetic allows us that that strip &quot;torn upward,&quot; &quot;wound three times around the waist,&quot; &quot;and secured by a sort of hitch in the back&quot; (said &quot;hitch&quot; being enough to serve as a loop or handle), must have been at least seventy-two inches long. Therefore, as Marie Roget's skirt from hem to waist measured six feet, the young lady herself must have been nearly nine feet tall!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other details of this extraordinary young woman's costume are also absurd to a rational mind, but perhaps Poe's genius did not include millinery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Poe was often careless, even in important matters. The idea that supports the story of &quot;The Purloined Letter,&quot; is so very good that it is a pity to have such an absurd contradiction as this creep in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a trumpery filigree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantel-piece. In this rack, which had three or four compartments, were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This last was much soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in two, across the middle—as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless, had been altered, or stayed in the second. It had a large black seal, bearing the D—cipher very conspicuously, and was addressed, in a diminutive female hand, to D—, the Minister, himself. It was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into one of the upper divisions of the rack.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not probable that any eccentricity on the part of the writer of the missive resulted in having the seal and the address on the same side of the letter; it is more likely a slip of Poe's fertile pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The well-known impossible condition mentioned in &quot;The Raven,&quot; where the lamp-light streams over the bird and casts his shadow on the floor, while the bird himself is sitting on a bust over the door, can perhaps be explained by a transom and a hall light. But one rarely places a bust in front of a transom, as it would mean decreased efficiency for both, and we prefer to think this another of Poe's slips of attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Poe's &quot;The Oblong Box,&quot; we quote this description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The box in question was, as I say, oblong. It was about six feet in length by two and a half in breadth;—I observed it attentively, and like to be precise. Now this shape was peculiar; and no sooner had I seen it, than I took credit to myself for the accuracy of my guessing. I had reached the conclusion, it will be remembered, that the extra baggage of my friend, the artist, would prove to be pictures, or at least a picture; for I knew he had been for several weeks in conference with Nicolino; and now here was a box which, from its shape, could possibly contain nothing in the world but a copy of Leonardo's &quot;Last Supper;&quot; and a copy of this very &quot;Last Supper&quot; done by Rubini the younger, at Florence, I had known for some time to be in the possession of Nicolino. This point, therefore, I considered as sufficiently settled. I chuckled excessively when I thought of my acumen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the box was really a coffin, containing a dead body, it seems scarcely possible that it could look like a flat picture! At any rate, a coffin could not be mistaken for a box, which from its shape, could possibly contain nothing but a copy of &quot;The Last Supper.&quot; It would need several superimposed pictures to fill a box of that shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Conan Doyle is exceedingly careful in the logic of his details; and, except for rapidly burning papers in bulk, he makes few definite slips. Occasionally, however, he forgets what he has previously said about Sherlock Holmes' mental characteristics. But perhaps the reason is that instead of stepping into the pages of &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; a fully rounded and developed figure, Sherlock Holmes, during the first four or five years of his career as a public character, was in a constant state of evolution. It would be no easy matter for his creator to explain away certain striking inconsistencies of statement. For example, in an early chapter of &quot;A Study in Scarlet,&quot; Watson tries to fathom the intentions of his reticent roommate by making a list of Holmes' curious accomplishments and limitations. His knowledge of literature was put down as &quot;nil.&quot; &quot;Of contemporary literature, philosophy, and politics, he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done.&quot; This is rather definite. Yet in &quot;The Sign of the Four,&quot; the very next book, we are shown Sherlock Holmes advising Watson to read Winwood Reade's &quot;The Martyrdom of Man,&quot; citing French aphorisms, quoting Goethe in the original German, referring to Jean Paul in reference to Carlyle, reverting once more to Win- wood Reade, and finally winding up with another bit of Goethe In &quot;The Adventure of the Red-Headed League,&quot; he quoted from Gustave Flaubert's correspondence with George Sand and in &quot;A Case of Identity&quot; he makes use of a quotation from the Persian Hafiz, who, he asserts, has as much sense and as much knowledge of the world as the Latin Horace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The House Opposite&quot; by Elizabeth Kent, the heroine is greatly embarrassed for lack of funds, and makes the definite statement that she has not enough money to carry her from New York to Bar Harbor. But almost in the next paragraph she states that she has some shopping to do, and she finds this is a good opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These slips are unnecessary; and though not heinous offences, they cause the reader to lose confidence in his author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, some statements, while barely possible, are too improbable for ready belief. In Gaboriau's &quot;The Widow Lerouge,&quot; we read this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Old Taberet examined with extreme care the dead woman's finger-nails; and, using infinite precaution, he even extracted from behind them several small particles of kid. The largest of these pieces was not above the twenty-fifth part of an inch in length; but all the same their color was easily distinguishable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can scarcely imagine human finger-nails scraping off sufficient lavender kid from an assailant's gloves to serve as evidence, and we doubt if it could be proved possible by practical experiment. Though original and picturesque clues are desirable, yet care should be taken to have them carry the weight of common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-use-of-illustrative-plans&quot;&gt;The Use of Illustrative Plans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very annoying error often met is putting the plans in the book too late. By plans, we mean, the architectural sketch showing the rooms of the house or the arrangement of the grounds, with an X &quot;where the body was found.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, it is wise not to have a plan necessary to the understanding of the story. But some plots cannot be clearly understood without a plan. In such a case, have the diagram well and simply drawn, with as few lines as possible, and no unnecessary details. Moreover, present the plan at the beginning of the story. It is a most frequent error to insert the plan long after the situation has been fully described and the reader has pictured the entire scene for himself in his own mind. Then comes the plan, and it not infrequently turns his mental picture topsy-turvy. In a short-story it is less absolutely necessary, but in a book it is important to introduce the plan at the very first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Hand and Ring,&quot; by Anna Katharine Green, the intricacies of the plot necessitate two plans; one of the house where the crime is committed, and another of the neighboring town and country. The first of these plans appears on page 170 and the other on page 364. Both should have been given when the scenes they represent were first brought into the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Leavenworth Case&quot; by Anna Katharine Green, the plan of the house is given on page 8, and thereby allows the reader to start with a correct mental picture of the scene of the crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room&quot; and &quot;The Perfume of the Lady in Black,&quot; both by Gaston Leroux, require definite and somewhat elaborate plans. These are beautifully drawn, and occur in the book exactly at the time they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-locked-and-barred-room&quot;&gt;The Locked and Barred Room&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A situation greatly beloved of mystery-mongers is a crime committed in a room so locked and barred that there is apparently no possible ingress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the case in Poe's &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue,11 and the later explanation of how the intruder entered is simple, ingenious, and satisfactory. But since then, hundreds of stories have been written around a crime committed in a sealed room, with solutions of varying interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot is usually the same. The barred doors necessitate a forcible breaking in to discover the crime. Then, owing to the fact of the locks and bars, the dead man found in the room is adjudged a suicide. But, of course, later developments prove it to be murder and finally disclose how the murderer could get in and out and yet leave everything bolted on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often a secret passage is the solution, but this is trite; and to invent a cleverer explanation is the aim of the ambitious author. Gaston Leroux succeeded perfectly, in his &quot;Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; and few authors can touch the simple subtlety of his idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zangwill went at the matter deliberately. To quote from the introduction to &quot;Big Bow Mystery&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;For a long time before the book was written I said to myself that no mystery-monger had ever murdered a man in a room to which there was no possible access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The puzzle was scarcely propounded ere the solution flew up and the idea lay stored in my mind till years later.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular problem and its solution, in Zangwill's hands, is a masterpiece; and though incidentally in his book he tells of many suggested solutions, none compares with his own in simple though daring ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A writer does well to use this always arrestive plot, if he have some new and interesting explanation to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 26&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;final-advices&quot;&gt;FINAL ADVICES&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until lately the Detective Story has not been looked upon as worthy of serious consideration from a technical point of view. But in the minds of many it has now risen to a place where it calls for standardization. Detective Stories in the last half century have progressed in two directions, good and bad. In fact they have fairly mushroomed out in all grades of quality. And so, to meet the growing appreciation of a good Detective Story, it is worth while to do one's best in writing them as they should be written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, hundreds of them are published every year, whose authors belong to &quot;The mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But although Pope made that very expressive line, he said also:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;True ease in writing, comes from art, not chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As those move easiest who have learned to dance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent book on the subject of the game of Bridge, the author cleverly designates the grades of Bridge players thus: Idiots, Butchers, Tinkers, Artists, and Necromancers. The student of Detective Stories will at once recognize that these designations very aptly describe writers of detective fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Poe was the master of this sort of technique, he was of course a necromancer; but the other names to be put in his class are exceedingly few. We have many Artists writing detective stories, and many more who may be called Tinkers. The lower grades, though voluminous their output, we will not consider here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;general-qualities-of-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;General Qualities of the Detective Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as a keynote to the story we would write let us remember that its success depends first of all upon the interest of the mystery. Perhaps the voice of the public as expressed by the literary critic best tells us what is desired. To quote from the review of a very recent Detective Story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The new physician sets about a stealthy investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He finds that in the neighboring house, behind the blue wall, something odd is in progress—the doors are locked against him. The eager question which keeps the reader hurrying through the four hundred pages is 'What will he discover?1 As often happens, the solution scarcely supports the weight of the mystery. The story is a fantastic tangle, written with polished literary craftsmanship. But it is too ingenious in its opening to live up to its promises. It leaves one disappointed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a blot on our escutcheon that we should be accused of often presenting an explanation too slight to support the mystery. Even polished literary craftsmanship cannot make up for the unpardonable sin of a disappointing solution. But this by no means disparages the value of literary excellence. This ought ye to have done, but not to leave the other undone. With all the power that in you lies make for literary craftsmanship; but strive equally hard to perfect a plot which though built on accepted even if hackneyed models, has a few points of absolute originality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice in Anna Katharine Green's books how there is invariably some clever original touch which has never been used before. In, for instance, &quot;Initials Only,&quot; the young woman is shot, fatally, but no bullet can be found. As we discover later, instead of a bullet, the assassin used an icicle! Could anything be more unexpected? The sharp needle of ice pierced her heart and of course melted immediately and left no trace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the novel and original touches, though greatly desirable, are incidental to the plot, which should be built on the strong and rational foundations used by our best writers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As examples of excellent construction, read, &quot;Hand and Ring,&quot; &quot;The Mystery of a Hansom Cab,&quot; &quot;The DeBercy Affair,&quot; &quot;That Mainwaring Affair,&quot; or &quot;The Accomplice.&quot; All of these are plotted entirely in accordance with the best usage, and may serve as models of construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of short-stories, such definite and careful building of the plot is less imperative, as the author has room only for the single incident of the crime, and a short and swift account of its solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specially ingenious plots, like &quot;Big Bow Mystery&quot; or &quot;The mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; may not be achieved by everyone; but all may pay heed to the soundness of construction required by even the simplest plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;correctness&quot;&gt;Correctness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in everything else, the writer should be careful of his diction. In a way, the detective story demands accurate English even more than polished expression. We have seen the word suspicion used as a verb, in a story by an educated author. Even Sir Conan Doyle allows his wonderful work to be marred by such slips as inferred for implied; relation for relative; and even an absolute grammatical error, when Holmes says, &quot;It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to help you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, one frequently meets with such errors as a reference to a &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; when what they really mean is Frankenstein's Monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these things are unpardonable, and especially so in a field of literature where accuracy is a prime element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without overworking the poor words, learn to use intelligently and correctly—deduce, connote; vital, and incidental; fact, and truth; and all of the catch words that belong to the peculiar conditions of our subject—even ratiocination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;names&quot;&gt;Names&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especial attention should be paid to the names of the characters in our story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the influence of a right name is felt in real life, how much more so in fiction! In real life it is a matter of chance or of lucky accident if the baptismal name prove a just and congruous one, suited to the character and the circumstances of the owner. The natural parent may claim forgiveness for error on the score that he could not foresee the possible career of the child whom he may have handicapped at the altar. The author of a work of fiction can make no such plea. His characters should take form in his brain, like Minerva in the skull of Jupiter; they should be armed at all points, and the most vulnerable point of their equipment is an unworthy name. Yet knowledge of the thing desired does not necessarily lead to its easy discovery. It is a matter for thought, for research, for studious inquiry. Great skill and nicety of perception must be called into play. The effect must not be too crudely palpable. Suggestion, not insistence, is needed. The good old trick which pleased our simpler forefathers, that which consists in merely labelling a character,—all ingenuous, but not ingenious, stratagem,—has had its day. It was carried to an extreme in the early English drama, where even Shakespeare gives us such names among his minor characters as Mouldy, Feeble, Shadow, Shallow, etc., and it retained its hold on the comic stage down to the time of the Lydia Languishes, the Sneer- wells, the Mrs. Malaprops of Sheridan, the Sir Fopling Flutters of Vanbrugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While such definitely descriptive names are perhaps not to be used, let us at least choose names that will seem to connote the effect intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Scientific Sprague&quot; is a good name because it is especially descriptive; and perhaps also because it is alliterative. We remember that name when we would not remember &quot;Ledroit Conners&quot; who figures in an equally good series of stories. &quot;Craig Kennedy&quot; does not stick in our memory like the &quot;Thinking Machine,&quot; and &quot;Rouletabille,&quot; though expressive in intent, has not the arrestiveness of &quot;Raffles.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;titles&quot;&gt;Titles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the names of the characters are in their way important, how much more so is the title of the story. When Poe began his stories, no titles were hackneyed and he was at liberty to use &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; and &quot;The Mystery of Marie Roget&quot; without being trite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as both these titles have been borrowed hundreds of times, it is wise for the young writer to endeavor to think up an original title. Conan Doyle was an artist at this, and though all of his titles were &quot;The Adventure of—,&quot; the rest of the phrase was so striking as to command interest at once. Whose curiosity would not be aroused by &quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band,&quot; or &quot;The Adventure of the Five Orange Pips&quot;? Incidentally, Conan Doyle has mentioned a dozen or more attractive titles, to which he has never yet written stories. We wish we might read of &quot;The Adventure of the Paradol Chamber,&quot; &quot;The Singular Tragedy of the Atkinson Brothers at Trincomalee,&quot; and many others of this list of equally fascinating titles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The Darlington Substitution Scandal,&quot; &quot;The Arnsworth Castle Affair,&quot; &quot;The Affair of the Amateur Mendicant Society,&quot; &quot;The Loss of the 'Sophy Anderson',&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Grice Patersons in Uffa,&quot; &quot;The Camberwell Poisoning Case,&quot; &quot;The Dundas Separation Case,&quot; &quot;The Affair of the Reigning Family of Holland,&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Tired Captain,&quot; &quot;The Trepoff Murder,&quot; &quot;The Affair of the Netherland Sumatra Company,&quot; &quot;The Tankerville Club Scandal,&quot; &quot;The Case of Mrs.Etheredge,&quot; &quot;The Affair of the King of Scandinavia,&quot; &quot;The Manor House Case,&quot; &quot;The Tarleton Murder,&quot; &quot;The Affair of the Aluminum Crutch,&quot; &quot;The Case ofVamberry, the Wine Merchant,&quot; &quot;Ricoletti of the Club Foot and His Abominable Wife,&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Old Russian Woman.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many authors content themselves with &quot;The Mystery of Maple Hollow,&quot; or &quot;The Connolly Case.&quot; Such titles as, &quot;That Mainwaring Affair,&quot; &quot;That Affair at Elizabeth,&quot; &quot;That Affair&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next door&quot; are good in their way, but the phrase has been overworked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some titles are so obvious that they are repeated, probably unwittingly, by various authors. &quot;The Long Arm&quot; has been chosen as a title by Samuel N. Gardenhire, E. Phillips Oppen- heim, Richard Harding Davis, and Mary E. Wilkins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A Mysterious Disappearance,&quot; appealed to the taste of three or four authors, while &quot;The Corpus Delicti&quot; took the fancy of two or three more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such titles as &quot;The Scales of Justice,&quot; or &quot;Vengeance is Mine&quot; are entirely legitimate, though not novel. Titles like those chosen by Anna Katharine Green are much more to be commended: &quot;The Woman in the Alcove,&quot; &quot;The Doctor, his Wife and the Clock,&quot; &quot;Initials Only&quot; or &quot;One of my Sons,&quot; are unique and therefore arrestive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Trevor Case,&quot; is a hackneyed style of title, while &quot;The Circular Staircase&quot; is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule avoid unpleasant words in a title. Omit the words Murder, Crime, or Blood. These words are inevitable in your text, but unattractive in your title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fine, do your best to make both matter and manner of your story the best that in you lies; and never for a moment commit the error of thinking that because you are writing a detective story you may scamp your efforts to achieve good literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quote by permission the following advice by Mr. Arlo Bates. Though written for the benefit of young authors in all fields of literature, it may be applied especially to writers of detective fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A youth who decides to follow a life of letters will not do amiss to be frank with himself at the start. He may say to his inner self: 'I can make money with my pen. It is a business, like another. I should find it pleasant, to be sure, to try to produce literature; but I see that it does not pay. I prefer the flesh pots of Egypt, hot, well filled, highly spiced, to any vague promises of the delights of a far-off and rather doubtful Canaan of art. I will write what people will buy; and I will take my reward as I go, in pleasant applause and good hard cash.1 Or if he be of another mind, he may have the hardihood to say to himself something of this sort: 'It is true that if I do the best I can in literature, I shall be hard put to it to pay the butcher and the baker. The candlestick-maker will dwell in abundance, while by the glimmer of a tallow dip set in the meanest of his wares I wearily and very likely hungrily write that which not one man in a thousand would care to read, and not one woman in ten thousand would think of taking out of the circulating library. There is, moreover, the gravest doubt whether, even after I am dead and cannot enjoy it if it comes, reputation will crown my work. Yet in spite of all this, I am so constituted that the delight of doing my best, the pleasure of serving my art, will make up to me for all that I forego in choosing to strive toward literary perfection. I elect to walk while others ride, to be splashed by mud from the carriage wheels of the wife of the man whose rubbish is sold by the million copies and given away with the popular brand of soap; I will starve if it must be, but I will live my own life.1 Something of one of these decisions it will be well to adopt at the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;When the decision is made, it is to be abided by. A man has no more right to complain at the loss of the thing he deliberately let go than he has to be angry that two and two make four. It is true that few are able to make the higher choice without some secret thought,—that unacknowledged hope which, all intangible as it is, is one of the most comforting delusions of life; that hope not put into word even in the most secret chamber of the heart, yet without which so many heroisms would be impossible-some deeply hidden conviction that fortune will to them be so propitious that all discouraging precedents will be violated. It is so hard for youth to believe that anything it desires is impossible. The ardent young author, working steadfastly in his attic, has a firm faith that fame and fortune will one day be his in abundance. That this dream is so often false is profoundly pathetic; but it is not a vital misfortune if the man be virile enough not to be soured by disappointment and disillusion. Character is the great stake for which one plays the game of life; and if this is won, the rest is of less, no matter how grave, weight. The failure of literary aspirations is bitter, but the worst is escaped as long as one is able firmly to say: 'I chose the pleasure of an unviolated literary conscience, the delight of serving art with my best endeavor, rather than the rewards of meretricious work. I have had what I bargained for; and I stand by that ungrudgingly. If I hoped for a bonus at the hand of Fortune and have not got it, at least I have received the price which I stipulated.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The price stipulated in such a bargain with life is at least sure. He who elects to serve literature and to do his best for the pleasure of such doing, cannot be robbed of his reward; while he who works for other advantages may and often does fail of securing them. He who makes the pleasure of being true to his best instincts his purpose, is secure of the satisfaction which comes of nobility of intention and consciousness of high aim, while the man who seeks money and notoriety often comes to grief. A writer may even be willing to stoop to any and every low device to gain popularity, and yet may miss it. It is one thing for a mail to be willing to sell himself to the devil, and quite another to induce the devil to pay his price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No man devotes his life to any work without some more or less clearly defined idea of what he shall gain from such a muse The reward of literature is not money, although occasionally that will come in abundance, and in these days usually rewards in moderation any literary labor done at all well. The reward is not reputation, albeit that cannot but be pleasant to any man who wins it, for no sane human being can remain totally indifferent to the approval and applause of his follows. These things are good, but they are net the true guerdons of art. The real reward of literature is the joy of producing it. There arc few earthly delights which can compare with the pleasure of artistic creation: to feel a work grow in the mind and take shape under the hand; to look on a new found idea as a 'watcher of the skies when a new planet swims into his ken;' to be lifted above whatever is small or petty or annoying, whatever is unsatisfactory in human life, by the power of the creative impulse,—that is the true good of the literary worker; and it is a good so great that all others may well seem petty beside it. There is much else which is attractive and desirable,—contact with alert minds, familiarity with the thought of the world, and the enjoyment of an artistic atmosphere,—but these are less certain, and are really of less importance. The most admirable return for all one's labors that he hath under the sun, is the joy of a congenial pursuit and the inspiration of creative effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This may seem somewhat far from the standards of a workaday world. It is certain that no transports of literary creation will pay the coal bill or settle an account at the grocer's. Necessity knows no law, and a man may be forced to drudgery with the pen as with the pickaxe. To him, however, who is willing and able to sacrifice material to intellectual ends, what I have said is of actual and practical application.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-omnipresence-of-footprints&quot;&gt;The Omnipresence of Footprints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt the most woefully overdone and mix-done evidence is that of footprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps with the exception of that one found by Robinson Crusoe, no footprints in fiction,—not even those left on the sands of time for that hypothetical forlorn and shipwrecked brother,—have been either plausible or, in their evidence, credible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble began with Gaboriau and M. Lecoq, for Poe never descended to the low level of footprints. But in &quot;Monsieur Lecoq,&quot; the stage is set on the very first page by the phrase, &quot;It had snowed heavily for the past few days and the thaw had now begun.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the obliging thaw by no means obliterates the footprints on which the story stands. As Lecoq remarks, &quot;The fellow had a neat pair of boots. What an impression, eh! clear and distinct. Why, you may count every nail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an impression in thawing snow is remarkable of itself, but is as nothing compared to the further details that they learn. Indeed, for twenty-four pages the revelations and declarations of those footprints hold us spellbound. They are dramatically eloquent and show what seems to be even more than human intelligence. No quotation can do them justice. The aspiring author will do well to read, mark and inwardly digest those footprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially interesting is the detailed description of how Lecoq made plaster of Paris casts of these footprints, undeterred by the fact that the weather had grown much milder and a warm rain had begun to fall. But the thoughtful and considerate rain merely drizzled until the plaster casts were all done, and then, we are told, &quot;it immediately began to come down in earnest.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the plaster casts were safe, and ready to corroborate all M. Lecoq's deductions, and lead the reader through the devious mazes of Gaboriau's genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we must agree that a great responsibility was put upon those thoughtlessly made footprints. But it is a no more elaborate affair of the sort than that described in Doyle's &quot;A Study in Scarlet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with: &quot;No rain had fallen for a week before the evening of the murder.&quot; The clayey soil thus being very dry required a great deal of moisture to fit it for footprints, and so, as we are told, &quot;It rained in torrents.&quot; This left everything very wet and sloppy for Holmes' investigation. But notwithstanding this and notwithstanding that the pathway was so trampled that Holmes said, &quot;If a herd of buffaloes had passed along there, there could not be a greater mess,&quot; our Transcendent Detective had no trouble whatever in reading the footnotes of the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor was there any difficulty in reading further footprints made in the dust inside the house, where one man had stood still and one had &quot;walked up and down, growing more and more excited.&quot; It was no matter that their shoes were soaking wet and muddy; it was no matter that they themselves were dripping with the torrential rain; they left clear and legible footprints in the dust. Then another man came, tramped along the buffalo walk and went into the room, walked around, knelt down, and cut various capers, but though soaking wet, he too, left neat prints that any running detective might read!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the story of &quot;The Resident Patient,&quot; it had &quot;rained hard that very afternoon&quot; and the suspected man rather untidily left several muddy footprints on the light stair carpet. The hero of the story came in directly afterwards, and went both up and down the same stairs, leaving no footprints! But this paradox presents no difficulties to the footprint expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;My dear fellow,&quot; said he, &quot;it is one of the first solutions that occurred to me, but I was soon able to corroborate the doctor's tale. This young man has left prints upon the stair-carpet which made it quite superfluous for me to ask to see those which he had made in the room. When I tell you that his toes were square-toed instead of being pointed like Blessington's, and were quite an inch and a third longer than the doctor's, you will acknowledge that there can be no doubt as to his individuality.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These square-toed prints, since they showed that they were an inch and a third longer than the doctor's, lead us to think that the man who made them went upstairs sidewise like a crab, or else he could scarcely have made the complete footprint visible. Truly the footprints in detective stories are fearfully and wonderfully made!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One time, however, even Sherlock Holmes confesses his powers at fault. In &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; there is a fearful quagmire, so quivering and undulating that &quot;its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked, and when we sank into it, it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down. Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the path, and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have stepped his foot upon firm land again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of this peculiar land formation we are told, &quot;there was no chance of finding footsteps in the mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them.&quot; True, one would hardly expect footprints in that morass, but you never can tell!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;other-miraculous-discoveries&quot;&gt;Other Miraculous Discoveries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes, having declared himself Past Grand Master in the art of reading footprints, it is not surprising to hear him discourse thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Roof quite out of reach. Yet a man has mounted by the window. It rained a little last night. Here is a print of a foot in mould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy mark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. See here, Watson! This is really a very pretty demonstration.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;That is not a footmark,&quot; said I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a wooden stump. You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot with a broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the timber toe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is the wooden-legged man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Quite so.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another story, a subordinate tells Holmes that &quot;the garden path was saturated with recent rain, and ought to show footprints, &quot; but he could discern none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;One moment,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Where does this path lead to?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;To the road.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;How long is it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A hundred yards or so.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;At the point where the path passes through the gate, you could surely pick up the tracks?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Unfortunately, the path was tiled at that point.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, on the road itself?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No, it was all trodden into mire.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Tut-tut! Well, then, these tracks upon the grass, were they coming or going?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It was impossible to say. There was never any outline.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A large foot or a small?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You could not distinguish.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Holmes gave an ejaculation of impatience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It has been pouring rain and blowing a hurricane ever since/1 said he. &quot;It will be harder to read now than that palimpsest. Well, well, it can't be helped. What did you do, Hopkins after you had made certain that you had made certain of nothing?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, although harder than palimpsest reading, Mr. Holmes went to the grass border in question, and had no difficulty in reading it glibly. Here is the scene:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This is the garden path of which I spoke, Mr. Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'll pledge my word there was no mark on it yesterday.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;On which side were the marks on the grass?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This side, sir. This narrow margin of grass between the path and the flower-bed. I can't see the traces now, but they were clear to me then.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, yes; someone has passed along,&quot; said Holmes, stooping over the grass border. &quot;Our lady must have picked her steps carefully must she not, since on the one side she would leave a track on the path, and on the other an even clearer one on the soft bed?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To discern these carefully-picked steps on grass, though it had been &quot;pouring rain and blowing a hurricane&quot; ever since they were made, is indeed good work of its sort! One of Ottolengui's best stories, &quot;A Conflict of Evidence,&quot; has its third chapter called &quot;Footprints in the Snow.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I see,&quot; said the detective, &quot;what we may be most grateful for, and that is fresh snow. We must extend our investigation presently, and search for footprints.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This they proceeded to do, and the reader is invited to participate by means of a full-page map of house and grounds, with so many and such complicated trails of footprints all over it, that it looks like a Fashion Paper Supplement of patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We found four sets of tracks,&quot; said the detective, exultantly, &quot;besides the dog's, which latter may prove of value. Two of these we think were made by women, and two by men. For convenience, I have numbered them 1, 2, 3 and 4.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So astute are the deductions from these interlaced trails that a small portion of them reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The same as you selected, but for this reason. Notice that here the direction is towards the summer-house, as you just now said; whilst on this side, the point of the toe shows that the owner of the foot returned to her starting point. Unless we find another trail, leading from the house, we have here proof conclusive that this party has remained indoors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;How so? I don't see that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Yet it is simple. Notice that the steps away from the house are very indistinct, whilst those coming toward us are, on the contrary, clear, and sharply defined. The woman left this spot whilst it was yet snowing, so the snow filled up the tracks somewhat. Wherever she went, and that we shall find out perhaps by following the trail, she did not start for home, or to be accurate, she did not reach here, till the snow had ceased falling, as the clear marks testify.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A kind-hearted though uneducated neighbor helps them out with the usual testimony as to weather observations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, as I said before, I went ter bed airly, seven o'clock in fact; 't was snowin' hard then, an1 I 'lowed't would keep up all night; I slept purty sound but was waked up by the noise my girls made cornin' in from a visit ter a neighbor's. You know how't is when a man's woke up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He's kinder crusty an1 more 'an all, can't tell whether he's slept ten hours or ten minutes. So as the girls went by my door, I growled out: 'An't you purty late gittin1 home?1 'No pop, it's just nine o'clock,' come the answer. Seein' as how I had a good night's rest before me, I felt a leetle mite pleasanter an' in a' easier tone I said: 'I s'pose the snow's purty deep, an't it?' 'Not very,&quot; says one on 'em, 'it stopped awhile ago, an' the moon's out now!! That's all was said. But you see that shows it didn't snow after nine, tho' ef you want it nearer, mebbe I kin find out from the girls.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;remarkable-deductions-from-footprints&quot;&gt;Remarkable Deductions from Footprints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Quests of Paul Beck&quot; by M. McDonnell Bodkin, we find this exceedingly clever deduction from footprints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bending low he scrutinized the edge of the pathway closely as he walked. Twice he found a break in the clean-cut edge, examined it carefully and went on. The third time he found the mark of one of the new-fashioned rubber heels in the turf. The ground had been soft when the mark was made—it was hard now. The segment of the circular heel was cut deep and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Rutherford wore rubber heels,&quot; he said to the other, rather as one who makes a statement than one who asks a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Strangely nodded. Mr. Beck was on his knees on the grass sward with a magnifying glass close to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He put the grass softly aside as a surgeon parts the hair to examine a scalp wound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Was Mr. Rutherford a heavy man?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mr. Strangely did not hear him at first, and he repeated the question. &quot;Well, no, he was rather light and wiry, but he had big feet if that's what you mean.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Right,&quot; said Mr. Beck, &quot;here is a full footmark.&quot; He got up from his knees and walked on briskly, picking up the trail as if it were the &quot;scent&quot; of a paper-chase, though Strangely1 s eyes could find only a few vague marks amongst the grass. The track skirted the woods and led them to the banks of a deep, dumb river that ran slowly, level with its brim. Along the banks of the river the track led them for about a mile, tending always away from the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Under the shelter of a clump of beech, Mr. Beck stopped short and began to cast about like a sporting dog that makes a dead set, weakens on it when he finds the bird has just left, and begins beating cautiously again. He examined every mark about the place with scrupulous care, went on about twenty yards to where the river was crossed by a new iron bridge, and walked a little with bent head on the further side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mr. Strangely watched him curiously all the time, till he came back at last to the place where he had first pointed his game, and looked fixedly at the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then very quietly he said to Mr. Strangely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Rutherford's body is out there, under the water.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reading from footprints on grass, that is doing fairly well! He repeats his success in this instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Early next morning Mr. Beck was on the scene of the murder—not the stolid Mr. Beck of the day before, but active, eager, every sense keenly alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There was a curious suggestion about him of a well- trained setter dog when it is close upon the game—every nerve and muscle vibrant with suppressed excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Like a setter he beat round the spot, searching the ground with his eyes. There had been much rain of late, and the ground was still soft enough to take and hold footprints. He found three or four prints, small and sharp, of the heel of a girl's shoe. He could even trace where Dick Ackland's foot had slipped and torn the sod as he stopped and turned on his way to the brook when he heard the second revolver shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Vicar's footprints were faint and hard to follow (the lame foot lighter than the other) as he ran for the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At first Mr. Beck could only find a mere trace at intervals through the grass, but after a bit he reached the bottom of stiff clay that took the mould of the footprints like plaster of Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miss Mary E. Wilkins outdoes all competitors in her number of tabulated footprints. In her short detective story, &quot;The Long Arm,&quot; we find this interesting report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I'll tell you what,&quot; he said, after a longish pause, &quot;we'd trampled down the ground a good bit all round; we must have trampled out the murderer's footprints.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It's just possible,&quot; I said, &quot;but not likely that you shouldn't have left a square inch of shoeprint anywhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, indeed, that would not be likely in a Detective Story! So the Sergeant went hunting for footprints, with this gratifying result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sergeant Edwardes1 report on the footprints near the spot where the body of Miss Judson was found, at 9.35 P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;M., on October 17, 189-:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I have counted 43 distinct human footsteps and 64 partial imprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Of the 43, 24 are made by the left foot and only 19 by the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Of the 54 faint or partial impressions, I found 17 of the left foot and only 12 of the right, the rest are not distinctive enough to pronounce upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Of the total number of the fainter footprints, 18 are deeply marked in the soft clay, the others are less strongly impressed. Of the 18 that are deeply marked, 11 are made by the left foot, 7 by the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;This accords with what I was told subsequently—that Mr. Jex's three labourers, and Mr. Jex himself, on finding Miss Judson's dead body, at once tuck it up in their arms and bore it to the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Bearers of a heavy weight, such as a dead body, walking together, invariably bear heavily upon the left foot, both those who are supporting it on the left, and those who are supporting it on the right side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Distinguishing the Footprints by their length, breadth, and the pattern of the nail marks upon them, I find that they are the footprints of five separate persons, all of them men. I also found, clearly impressed, the footprints of the victim herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There had been heavy rain in the morning of the 17th, and the soil is a sticky clay. I examined it at daybreak on the morning of the 18th and, as it had not rained during the night, the impressions were as fresh as if they had just been made. By my orders no one had been allowed to come near the spot where the body was found during the night. Just outside the gate of the orchard, the grass has been long trodden away by passers-by, leaving the earth bare; and the patch of bare earth forms an area rather broader than the gate. On this area the body had fallen, and round about the spot where it had lain I found all the footprints on which I am reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I have compared the boots worn by the labourers with the impressions near the gate. They correspond in every particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In the case of the footprints of the three labourers, a majority of the deeper impressions are made by the left boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I therefore conclude that all three men came upon the spot only to carry away the body of the girl, and had no hand in her death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I argue the same from the footprints made by Mr. Jex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He also had borne more heavily with the left than with the right foot. He also, therefore, must have come on the spot only to bear off the body, and could have taken no part in the girl's murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There are almost an exactly equal number of impressions, plain or faint, of the footprints of these four persons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There remain the footprints of a fifth person. They are the impressions of a man's foot, but the hobnailed boots that made them, though full sized, are of a rather lighter make than the others, and the nail marks are smaller, the boots are newer, for the sides of the impression have a cleaner cut, and, what is important, the impressions of the left foot are in no case deeper than those of the right.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all this is only a beginning in each case. Such wonders as are discovered from the footprints we have referred to can only be appreciated by reading the books in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Midnight at Mears House,&quot; by Harrison J. Holt, one of the characters states in the first chapter, &quot;some one must have carried him out of the house and thrown him over the cliff; in which case there should be footprints to prove it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite right, of course there should be in a detective story. And there were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;After the rain of the night before, the ground was still soft in places. We had gone but a few steps when we came upon a clear deep footprint.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then they went on and followed the footprints to the very edge of the cliff, to &quot;the exact spot, below which Arthur had found the body!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there's a criminal for you! He knew his business, and he went to it, making his footprints in a neat, workmanlike manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really good example of a logical and credible footprint is found in &quot;The Whispering Man,&quot; by Henry Kitchell Webster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;On the hardwood floor was the imprint of the heel of a man's rubber, showing the criss-cross marks that keep you from slipping—a new rubber, but it had been a little damp and a little dirty, and had left a mark.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that is an honest, truthful footprint, and the statement that it was a new rubber gives it the last touch of veracity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the best disquisition on footprints and their value is found in &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; by Gaston Leroux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rouletabille's unerring perspicacity realizes the absurdity of much of this footprint evidence. He remarks on it thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I awaited the coming of daylight and then went down to the front of the chateau, and made a detour, examining every trace of footsteps coming towards it or going from it. These, however, were so mixed and confusing that I could make nothing of them. Here I may make a remark,—I am not accustomed to attach an exaggerated importance to exterior signs left in the track of a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The method which traces the criminal by means of the tracks of his footsteps is altogether primitive. So many footprints are identical. However, in the disturbed state of my mind, I did go into the deserted court and did look at all the footprints I could find there, seeking for some indication, as a basis for reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If I could but find a right starting point! In despair I seated myself on a stone. For over an hour I busied myself with the common, ordinary work of a policeman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Like the least intelligent of detectives, I went on blindly over the traces of footprints which told me just no more than they could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I came to the conclusion that I was a fool, lower in the scale of intelligence than even the police of the modern romancer. Novelists build mountains of stupidity out of a footprint on the sand, or from an impression of a hand on the wall. That's the way innocent men are brought to prison. It might convince an examining magistrate or the head of a detective department, but it's not proof. You writers forget that what the senses furnish is not proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If I am taking cognizance of what is offered me by my senses I do so but to bring the results within the circle of my reason. That circle may be the most circumscribed, but if it is, it has this advantage—it holds nothing but the truth! Yes, I swear that I have never used the evidence of the senses but as servants to my reason. I have never permitted them to become my master. They have not made of me that monstrous thing—worse than a blind man—a man who sees falsely. And that is why I can triumph over your error and your merely animal intelligence, Frederic Larsan!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the would-be author need not deem these footprint clues entirely unavailable for his use. They are a permissible part of the required mechanism, and utilized in moderation, add rather than detract from the usual plot. They are not truth, but they make interesting fiction, if worked up with a semblance of reality and with convincing circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;fingerprints-and-teeth-marks&quot;&gt;Fingerprints and Teeth-marks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent is the reading of thumb and fingerprints. The discovery of the individuality of fingerprints gave detectives a new field, both in fiction and in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a book of stories, &quot;Adventures of the World's Greatest Detectives,&quot; by George Barton, which are said by the author to be literally true, we have an astonishing coincidence. A detective found in a public house a drinking glass that had on it perfectly distinct marks of four fingers and a thumb. Following the trail, a cab was found, on the door of which were five distinct prints of four fingers and a thumb. After reproducing on sensitized paper, the two sets of imprints were found to be identical! This is a Scotland Yard story, but as the author confesses in his preface to &quot;a few pardonable embellishments,&quot; we can't help thinking that pardon is desired in this case. However, fingermarks are undoubtedly used largely in real detection, and have not yet been overdone in fiction. Indeed, our up-to-date criminals are said to wear rubber gloves so they will leave no prints. And in &quot;The Silent Bullet,&quot; by Arthur B. Reeve, we are told of an ingenious miscreant who &quot;painted his hands lightly with a liquid rubber which he had invented himself. It did all that rubber gloves would do, and yet left him the free use of his fingers with practically the same keenness of touch.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another ingenious contrivance is described in a recent tale, where a very bad man gets a wax impression of another man's thumb and makes falsely incriminating prints in suspicious places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all of these devices are legitimate, and if the alert author can contrive a new combination, or a new twist to an old one, he may produce a good situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of imprints, marks of teeth used in biting an apple, figure prominently in at least two modern stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One, in Arthur Morrison's &quot;The Case of Mr. Foggatt&quot; gives the detective an opportunity to air his knowledge of apples, which is as extraordinary as Sherlock Holmes's erudition regarding cigar ash. As it is of interest, we append his dissertation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;First, now, the apple was white. A bitten apple, as you must have observed, turns of a reddish brown color if left to stand long. Different kinds of apples brown with different rapidities, and the browning always begins at the core. This is one of the twenty thousand tiny things that few people take the trouble to notice, but which it is useful for a man in my position to know. A russet will brown quite quickly. The apple on the sideboard was, as near as I could tell, a Newtown pippin or other apple of that kind, which will brown at the core in from twenty minutes to half an hour, and in other parts in a quarter of an hour more. When we saw it, it was white with barely a tinge of brown about the exposed core. Inference: somebody had been eating it fifteen or twenty minutes before, perhaps a little longer—an inference supported by the fact that it was only partly eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I examined that apple, and found it bore marks of very irregular teeth. While you were gone, I oiled it over, and, rushing down to my rooms, where I always have a little plaster of Paris handy for such work, took a mould of the part where the teeth had left the clearest marks. I then returned the apple to its place for the police to use if they thought fit. Looking at my mould, it was plain that the person who had bitten that apple had lost two teeth, one at top and one below, not exactly opposite, but nearly so. The other teeth, although they would appear to have been fairly sound, were irregular in size and line. Now, the dead man had, as I saw, a very excellent set of false teeth, regular and sharp, with none missing. Therefore, it was plain that somebody else had been eating that apple. Do I make myself clear?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Quite! Go on!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There were other inferences to be made—slighter, but all pointing the same way. For instance, a man of Foggatt's age does not, as a rule, munch an unpeeled apple like a school-boy. Inference a young man, and healthy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By great good luck, the detective ran across the apple-biter again, took another cast and with the pair, which were identical, marched to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other apple-biter is in &quot;The Saintsbury Affair,&quot; by Roman Doubleday, and the details of the biting are much the same as in Mr. Morrison's story. This is an ingenious identification idea and any plan of such interesting nicety may be used in detective fiction. As Shakespeare's characters bite their thumbs when they choose, so may an all-wise author cause his puppets to bite apples at his own sweet will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Fictive Detectives' Working Library, this Monograph on Apples and their Habits should stand beside Sherlock Holmes technical monographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-use-of-coincidences&quot;&gt;The Use of Coincidences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An error into which the beginning author easily falls is the too lavish use of coincidences. While perhaps the majority of detective stories are founded upon coincidences, they must be made so plausible, so seemingly inevitable, that they shall not appear to be mere coincidences. A modern fiction detective thus frankly admits the value of coincidences in his work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Don't forget the fortunate coincidences,&quot; replied Average Jones modestly. &quot;They're about half of it. In fact, detective work, for all that is said on the other side, is mostly the ability to recognize and connect coincidences.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the reader cannot agree that a frankly announced coincidence makes as good a mystery problem as one where that element is left out. For instance in &quot;The Adventure of Black Peter,&quot; in his confession, the criminal relates: &quot;Like a fool I left my baccy-pouch upon the table.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pouch, so obligingly, even necessarily, left on the table was of course the clue to the criminal. As a further coincidence this remarkable pouch bore the initials &quot;P.C.,&quot; which quite conveniently pointed to a suspect named Peter Carey, as well as to the real criminal, Patrick Cairns. This being discovered, Sherlock Holmes says naively, &quot;I was convinced that the initials P.C. upon the pouch were a coincidence and not those of Peter Carey, since he seldom smoked and no pipe was found in his cabin.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this shows too clearly the author's dependence on a coincidence. In the completed structure the literary architect should not let his framework show, for it dispels illusion and either prevents or mars surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the whole question of coincidence is too deep and too really scientific to attempt its discussion here. Poe knew it to its last and finest degree, but not every one could follow its ramifications with the accuracy of his peculiar mind. He says in one instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Coincidences ten times as remarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it) happen to all of us every hour of our lives, without attracting even momentary notice. Coincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities: that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustrations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the theory of probabilities is too abstruse for any but scholars, a general knowledge of the relative values of coincidences is most useful to the writer of detective fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe says further:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There are few persons, even among the calmest thinkers, who have not occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling half credence in the supernatural, by coincidences of so seemingly marvellous a character that, as mere coincidences, the intellect has been unable to receive them. Such sentiments—for the half credences of which I speak have never the full force of thought—are seldom thoroughly stifled unless by reference to the doctrine of chance, or, as it is technically termed, the Calculus of Probabilities. Now this Calculus is, in its essence, purely mathematical; and thus we have the anomaly of the most rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and spirituality of the most intangible in speculation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The avenues of thought opened to our minds by these suggestions are fascinatingly attractive, and could we study the matter seriously it would soon put an end to many widespread fallacies of coincidence—such as receiving a letter from a friend one has been thinking of and ascribing it to telepathy—and like matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaboriau appreciated the futility of depending upon the coincidence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Don't forget,&quot; replied Lecoq, &quot;that the field of conjecture is boundless. Imagine whatever complication you like, I am ready to maintain that such a complication has occurred or will present itself some day. Lieuben, a German lunatic, bet that he would succeed in turning up a pack of cards in a certain order stated in a written agreement. He turned and turned ten hours per day for twenty years. He had repeated the operation 4,246,028 times when he succeeded.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But leaving aside these deeper doctrines, let us use coincidence when necessary, carefully veiling it, however, with plausibility. Work up to the coincidence until it seems to occur naturally. Invent causes to produce the effects that otherwise would have seemed pure coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-use-of-melodrama&quot;&gt;The Use of Melodrama&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another fault to be avoided is the use of melodramatic speech or incident. The day is past when readers are thrilled by the sort of diction that charmed Pomona of &quot;Rudder Grange,&quot; as she read aloud, &quot;Ha—Ha—Lord—Marmont—thundered—thou—too—shalt—suffer!&quot; And yet, in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; we read: '&quot;And the papers?1 asked the king, hoarsely; 'all is lost!&quot;'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to discover a loss of &quot;the papers&quot; without melodramatic exclamation; but moderate the speech of your characters at the time of the appalling discovery as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid, too, the use of sentiment. Romance is not now referred to; but other sentiments which though acceptable in the &quot;story of manners,&quot; tend to distract the reader of detective fiction. This field recognizes few emotions and no moral; and as a human document it depends for its success upon the primitive instincts of mankind and the material indications thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;dullness&quot;&gt;Dullness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid dull and prosy description. If any type of story depends on action and excitement, it is the type we are discussing. Keep before you always the question of your reader's attitude towards your work. Arrest their attention, rouse their curiosity, awake their interest, and you have made your start. Continue to stimulate all these to the highest pitch, and your story is written. Let your final explanation more than satisfy their anticipation, and you have made a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build everything toward the final climax, using minor surprises as stepping-stones by the way. Continually produce the unexpected Persistently lead the reader to believe one thing and then suddenly convince him that he ought to have known it was another! Use every art and craft that in you lies to mislead him, but in such a way that when he is turned back to the right path he will vow he misled himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the two great principles: to have your facts as straight and true as a mathematical proposition; and to have your fancies as fascinating and elusive as a fairy tale. In a word, the ideal writer of detective fiction should be the child of Euclid and Scheherazade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;unique-plots-and-their-solubility&quot;&gt;Unique Plots and Their Solubility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disdaining or tiring of the regulation plot some writers have branched off into erratic forms. This may be done with wonderfully fine effect if done perfectly. But only a genius, and an experienced one at that, should attempt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most brilliant achievement of this sort is Zangwill's &quot;Big Bow Mystery.&quot; As this book is now out of print, it may be well to state briefly its plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A widowed landlady, a Mrs. Drabdump, after repeated knock- ings on the bolted bedroom door of her lodger, Arthur Constant, fails to awaken him. Terrified by vague fears of tragedy, she rushes across the street to implore the help of a neighbor, Mr. Grodman. He returns with her, and together they break in the bolted door of Constant's bedroom. A horrible sight meets Mrs. Drabdump's eyes, as she discovers the young man dead in his bed with his throat cut from ear to ear. Both windows are fastened; the door, until burst in, was both locked and bolted; and there is no other opening in the room. Add to this the fact that no razor or weapon of any sort can be found, and the problem seems insoluble. What is probably the best jury scene in fiction concludes logically that since the room could not have been entered by any intruder it could not be murder and must be suicide. It also concludes logically that since no weapon is found and the doctors declare that the wound could not have been self-inflicted, it could not be suicide and must be murder! This ingenious deadlock forms the nucleus of the story which is elaborated with cunning skill and marvelous subtlety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most experienced reader is not prepared for the surprising denouement, which shows that the murder was committed by Mr. Grodman, after he broke open the door, and had been deliberately planned for by him, beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stated thus barely, the plot seems incredible; but as written by Mr. Zangwill, it is plausible, convincing, and intensely interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all. Detective Stories depend upon the ingenuity of the author—in the best, intellect is paramount. Characters, judged by other standards, may seem unreal without disturbing the reader's equanimity, provided the chain of causation is kept logically perfect. The disregard of this axiom has resulted in many failures. Gaboriau, not content to write a mere tale of mystery, tried to convert it into a well-rounded novel. But the most notable recent instance of the thing was the endeavor of Gaston Leroux in &quot;The Perfume of the Lady in Black,11 the sequel to &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room.&quot; Without knowing quite why, readers found their interest in it flagging. In some respects it is the subtlest story of its kind. The shifting semi- tropical atmosphere is finely caught and ought a priori to add intensity to the central mystery of doubtful identity. The mystery itself is developed with rare psychological insight, and the relation between a mother and son is so acutely defined as to make a certain noticeable halt in the process of detection seem perfectly natural. Yet impatience with the story is inevitable. From habit the reader holds his attention in readiness for running down a crime—for that and nothing more—and his mind relaxes when outlying material is brought in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Harry Thurston Peck says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The indispensable condition of a good mystery is that it should be able and unable to be solved by the reader, and that the writer's solution should satisfy. Many a mystery runs on breathlessly enough till the denouement is reached, only to leave the reader with the sense of having been robbed of his breath under false pretences. And not only must the solution be adequate, but all its data must be given in the body of the story. The author must not suddenly spring a new person or a new circumstance upon the reader at the end. Thus, if a friend were to ask me to guess who dined with him yesterday, it would be fatuous if he had in mind somebody of whom he knew I had never heard.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of all else, it is the mystery that arouses curiosity to the pitch of demanding explanation that counts. By few has it been played with a skill like that of Wilkie Collins, who, with little characterization or sentiment, without creating individuals of fiction whom we remember, or whose sayings we quote, could hold the attention of the novel-reading world with his &quot;Woman in White,&quot; or set them eagerly agog to find the whereabouts of the mysterious diamond taken from its Eastern sanctuary. For ingenuity of construction, blind leads, bafflings, and sustained interest &quot;The Moonstone&quot; stands high in the catalogue of the mysteries of fiction; and the reader was penetrating to a degree who fastened upon Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite the theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;women-as-writers-of-detective-stories&quot;&gt;Women as Writers of Detective Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a few among the best writers of detective fiction are women. That perspicacious critic, Julian Hawthorne, observes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I have often marvelled that women so seldom attempt this form of literature; many of them possess a good constructive faculty, and their love of detail and of mystery is notorious. Perhaps they are too fond of sentiment; and sentiment must be handled with caution in riddle stories.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a contemporary English essayist thus compliments our foremost American detective story writer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It may seem curious that women should be successful in a branch of fiction which many would be disposed to pronounce a masculine specialty. Perhaps Mrs. Green has herself supplied the explanation. In one of her best stories, 'That Affair Next Door,1 she introduces us to a very commonplace old maid, like most old maids curious, secretive, keenly observant of her neighbours' affairs, and fond of speculating about other people's business. Circumstances throw her into the very centre of a mysterious crime, and suddenly reveal in her all the qualities of a great detective. All the characteristics which made her a nuisance to her neighbours make her an invaluable ally to the police. The conception is a daring, and, I think, a true one. I fancy that the two faculties which the great Sherlock declared to be the prime necessities of a detective, observation and deduction, are feminine rather than masculine faculties. It will hardly be disputed that it is so in regard to the former; while, as to the latter, what man ever discovered as much about the inhabitants of the house opposite as any woman will deduce from the shape of their window blinds. Most women quite habitually indulge in the sort of ratiocination that Holmes practiced over the old hat. Be that as it may, Mrs. A.K. Green herself has certainly as much right as any contemporary writer to claim the mantle of Gaboriau for stories the excellent technique of which should put some popular writers on this side of the Atlantic to shame.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Katharine Green, who is Mrs. Charles Rohlfs in real life, is far and away the best in our home field. She is entirely conversant with all the rules of detective fiction, and her long list of books stands alone on the top shelf. She, herself, tells an amusing story in connection with her first book, the celebrated &quot;Leavenworth Case.&quot; She wrote this story when quite young; and, becoming absorbed in the work, wrote wherever she happened to be, using any kind of stationery that might be at hand, from finest letter paper to backs of old envelopes or torn out ledger leaves. Unheeding the growing length of her story, she kept on until she had every drawer of an old bureau overflowing with its manuscript. Concluding at last, she stuffed all her papers into a large suit-case, and sallied forth to a publisher. The first publisher she called upon eagerly accepted the story; but to her regret, the young author was obliged to cut out more than forty thousand words of her manuscript. But the result was the most popular and the best-written detective novel by an American.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other feminine authors have succeeded in this field. Mary E. Wilkins' short-story, &quot;The Long Arm,&quot; conforms to all the conditions required by the unwritten law. Natalie Lincoln, in &quot;The Trevor Case,&quot; and Mary Roberts Rinehart, in &quot;The Circular Staircase,&quot; have done admirable work, as has also Stella M. During in &quot;Love's Privilege.&quot; &quot;That Mainwaring Affair,&quot; by A.M. Barbour, is among the masterpieces of construction, and Florence Warden may be accounted among the best authors of mystery stories in England. The series of short-stories by Baroness d'Orczy, and Augusta Groner, are as clever as any written by men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of whatever sex the writer, or of whatever manner or style the setting, the one end and aim of the author must be curiosity aroused, increased and gratified. Other stories, other manners; but the Detective Story depends solely on this principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And ever remember Mr. Zangwill's dictum:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The mystery-story is just the one species of story that can not be told impromptu or altered at the last moment, seeing that it demands the most careful piecing together and the most elaborate dove-tailing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 16&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;more-devices&quot;&gt;MORE DEVICES&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;tabulated-clues&quot;&gt;Tabulated Clues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good device for the use of the Detective Story Writer is a list or catalog of clues, evidences, or suspects. A distinct tabulation serves to lay the conditions of the story clearly before the reader, and arouses his curiosity as to their meaning and consequences. Of course, if need be, the clues may be misleading; but if done properly, that, too, is a legitimate device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilkie Collins appreciated the use of this tabulation, and thus summed up the opening situation in &quot;The Moonstone&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Follow me carefully, Betteredge; and count me off on your fingers, if it will help you,&quot; says Mr. Franklin, with a certain pleasure in showing how clear-headed he could be, which reminded me wonderfully of old times when he was a boy. &quot;Question the first: Was the Colonel's Diamond the object of a conspiracy in India? Question the second: Has the conspiracy followed the Colonel's Diamond to England? Question the third: Did the Colonel know the conspiracy followed the Diamond; and has he purposely left a legacy of trouble and danger to his sister, through the innocent medium of his sister's child?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And much later in the story he again uses this device, purposely to mislead the reader:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;As to the person, or persons, by whom the crime was committed: It is known (1) that the Indians had an interest in possessing themselves of the Diamond. (2) It is at least probable that the man looking like an Indian, whom Octavius Guy saw at the window of the cab speaking to the man dressed like a mechanic, was one of the three Hindoo conspirators. (3) It is certain that this same man, dressed like a mechanic, was seen keeping Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite in view all through the evening of the twenty-sixth, and was found in the bedroom (before Mr. Ablewhite was shown into it) under circumstances which lead to the suspicion that he was examining the room. (4) A morsel of torn gold thread was picked up in the bedroom, which persons expert in such matters declared to be of Indian manufacture and to be a species of gold thread not known in England. (5) On the morning of the twenty-seventh, three men, answering to the description of the three Indians, were observed in lower Thames Street were traced to the Tower Wharf, and were seen to leave London by the steamer bound for Rotterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There is here moral, if not legal, evidence that the murder was committed by the Indians.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how cleverly he makes it seem certain that the crime was committed by the Indians. In a long and somewhat rambling tale like &quot;The Moonstone,&quot; a concise summary of evidence now and then is exceedingly effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Katharine Green frequently makes use of listed statistics. In &quot;That Affair Next Door,&quot; the heroine, who is doing detective work, makes a list, which is here given in part:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Having, as I thought, noticed some few facts in connection with it, from which conclusions might be drawn, I amused myself with jotting them down on the back of a disputed grocer's bill I happened to find in my pocket. Valueless as explaining this tragedy, being founded upon insufficient evidence, they may be interesting as showing the workings of my mind even at this early stage of the matter. They were drawn up under three heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First, was the death of this young woman an accident? Second, was it a suicide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Third, was it a murder?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Under the first head I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My reasons for not thinking it an accident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If it bad been an accident and she had pulled the cabinet over upon herself, she would have been found with her feet pointing towards the wall where the cabinet had stood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(But her feet were towards the door and her head under the cabinet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The decent, even precise, arrangement of the clothing about her feet, which precludes any theory involving accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Under the second:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reason for not thinking it suicide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;She could not have been found in the position observed without having lain down on the floor while living and then pulled the shelves down upon herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(A theory obviously too improbable to be considered.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Under the third:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reason for not thinking it murder, etc., etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the principals in &quot;The Circular Staircase,&quot; by Mary Roberts Rinehart, makes a similar list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I made out a list of questions and possible answers, but I seemed only to be working around in a circle. I always ended where I began. The list was something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Who had entered the house the night before the murder? Thomas claimed it was Mr. Bailey, whom he had seen on the footpath, and who owned the pearl cuff-link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why did Arnold Armstrong come back after he had left the house the night he was killed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No answer. Was it on the mission Louise had mentioned? Who admitted him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Gertrude said she had locked the east entry. There was no key on the dead man or in the door. He must have been admitted from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Who had been locked in the clothes chute?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Someone unfamiliar with the house, evidently. Only two people missing from the household, Rosie and Gertrude. Rosie had been at the lodge. Therefore—but was it Gertrude? Might it not have been the mysterious intruder again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Holladay Case,&quot; Mr. Burton E. Stevenson tells us that his detective &quot;drew up a resume of the case—to clear the atmosphere, as it were.&quot; It ran something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;March 13, Thursday—Holladay found murdered; daughter drives to Washington Square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;March 14, Friday—Coroner's inquest; Miss Holladay released; mysterious note received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;March 16, Sunday—Holladay buried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;March 18, Tuesday—Will opened and probated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;March 28, Friday—Miss Holladay returns from drive, bringing new maid with her and discharges old one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;March 29, Saturday—Gives orders to open summer house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;April 1, Tuesday—Asks for $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;April 2, Wednesday—Gets it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;April 3, Thursday—Leaves home ostensibly for Belair, in company with new maid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;April 14, Monday—Butler reports her disappearance;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Royce taken ill; I begin my search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There I stopped. The last entry brought me up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the cleverest lists, for the purpose of telling the story is one in &quot;The Leavenworth Case,&quot; by Anna Katharine Green:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taking a piece of paper, I jotted down the leading causes of suspicion as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Her late disagreement with her uncle, and evident estrangement from him, as testified to by Mr. Harwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The mysterious disappearance of one of the servants of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The forcible accusation made by her cousin—over- heard, however, only by Mr. Gryce and myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Her equivocation in regard to the handkerchief found stained with pistol smut on the scene of the tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Her refusal to speak in regard to the paper which she was supposed to have taken from Mr. Leavenworth's table immediately upon the removal of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The finding of the library key in her possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A dark record,&quot; I involuntarily decided, as I looked it over; but even in doing so began jotting down on the other side of the sheet the following explanatory notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Disagreements and even estrangements between relatives are common. Cases where such disagreements and estrangements have led to crime, rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The disappearance of Hannah points no more certainly in one direction than another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If Mary's private accusation of her cousin was forcible and convincing, her public declaration that she neither knew nor suspected who might be the author of this crime, was equally so. To be sure, the former possessed the advantage of being uttered spontaneously, but it was likewise true that it was spoken under momentary excitement, without foresight of the consequences, and possibly without due consideration of the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An innocent man or woman, under the influence of terror, will often equivocate in regard to matters that seem to criminate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here much of the problem is clearly stated in the first half of the list, and the working out of the solution is definitely indicated in the second part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listed suggestions are more useful in books than in short- stories; for in the former the complexities of the plot are more likely to need occasional rounding up and recalling to view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;worn-out-devices&quot;&gt;Worn-out Devices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trite and greatly worn device is the watch that stopped presumably when the crime was committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a typical use of this incident quoted from R. Ottolengui's &quot;The Crime of the Century&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I found Mr. Mora's watch under the bed, where it must have been knocked from the dressing-table. The fall had caused it to stop, and the hands indicated seven minutes of two, agreeing with the time during which the watchman testifies that young Mora was at home.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr. Mitchel, &quot;but do not go too fast. The watch may have run down. It is uncommon for a good watch to stop merely because it falls to the floor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Both of your points are good, in theory,&quot; replied the detective &quot;But neither applies in this instance. If a watch runs down, it cannot be started again without winding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By merely shaking this one I set it going, and to make assurance doubly sure, I let it run for an hour, when it was still keeping time. Next, though it be true that most watches would not be so easily stopped, this one, for some reason, is very sensitive to a blow. I tried the experiment of pushing it from the table to the floor, and at every attempt I found that it would cease its movement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea of a stopped watch is so obvious that it led authors at once to the idea of purposely stopping a watch with the intent of leading the detective and the reader astray. In fact, this was done as long ago as in Gaboriau's &quot;Crime of Orcival,&quot; where Lecoq, finding a clock which has been overturned in the struggle between the victim and his assassin, purposely turns the hands some four hours backward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This device has been used so often that the astute reader now disregards the evidence of the stopped watch in fiction. But still the clock or watch may play an important part in the plot, if managed with any degree of originality. In &quot;The Quests of Paul Beck&quot; the device is well used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mr. Beck looked at the German with manifest admiration. &quot;Forgive me for mentioning it. You would have made a first-class detective if you hadn't gone into another line of business. I should have told you that the evidence of the watch had been faked.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Faked?&quot; queried the other, with a blank look on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh! I see. Being a German, of course you don't understand our slang phrases. I examined the watch, and found that though the glass had been violently broken, the dial was not even scratched. The spring had been snapped, not by the blow but by overwinding. It was pretty plain to me the murderer had done the trick. He first put the hands on to half-past eight and then broke the spring, and so made his alibi. He got the watch to perjure itself. Neat, wasn't it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The German merely grunted. He was plainly impressed by the devilish ingenuity of the murderer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Whispering Man,&quot; by Henry Kitchell Webster, a large office clock seen in a mirror, makes twenty minutes before twelve appear to be twenty minutes after twelve, which leads to worth-while complications, and proves a clever device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Brander Matthews' story, &quot;The Twinkling of an Eye,&quot; a clock is used to conceal and manipulate a camera for the purposes of detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any such original application of commonplace material is worth-while in detective fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another maneuvre that has lost its grip on the attention of the trained reader, is the clumsily-upset table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Reigate Puzzle,&quot; Dr. Watson tells us;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Near the foot of the bed stood a dish of oranges and a carafe of water. As we passed it. Holmes, to my unutterable astonishment, leaned over in front of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing over. The glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit rolled about into every corner of the room. You've done it now, Watson,&quot; said he, coolly. &quot;A pretty mess you've made of the carpet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident was effective and of importance as Conan Doyle used it, but it has since been done so often as to have lost its power to surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hackneyed misleading device is that of high words between a victim and a suspect. In Chekhov's Russian story, &quot;The Safety Match,&quot; the author thus tries to cast suspicion on the valet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The master's valet, your worship,&quot; answered Ephraim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Who else could it be? He's a rascal, your worship! He's a drunkard and a blackguard, the like of which Heaven should not permit! He always took the master his vodka and put the master to bed. Who else could it be? And I also venture to point out to your worship, he once boasted at the public-house that he would kill the master!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea was right enough when first used; but experience has taught the modern reader that the one who threatens, or boasts an intent to kill never does so. The man who is overheard quarrelling with the victim just before his death is never by any chance the criminal in Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whispered words is a legitimate though slightly overworked way of preserving the secret. One character whispers to another something the reader is not allowed to overhear. This rouses the eavesdropping instinct latent in every human mind, and the reader scans the pages in endeavor to learn that whispered message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But attentive reading of the best detective stories will soonest teach a writer what devices may be used effectively and what not. It is a matter of taste, originality and cleverness. Even a trite device may be used with a new turn or twist and prove of great value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the longest roll of hackneyed devices in one book is found in &quot;That Mainwaring Affair,&quot; by A.M. Barbour. This is a most excellent and interesting story and of exceedingly good construction. The surprise is perfect and the plot original, but old and time-worn devices are repeatedly used. It includes the return of a long-lost brother, supposed to have been shipwrecked years before; stolen family jewels, a missing will; a twin brother; a birthmark identification; an illegitimate son of a designing housekeeper; a suspected private secretary; whispered words conveying the secret; a dragged lake; and innumerable disguises. All of these are justifiable, but a writer will do well to strike out on more original lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-use-of-disguise&quot;&gt;The Use of Disguise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disguise is not so much employed now as in former years when Lecoq was young. And the general public is now more keen to see through false whiskers than in the old days when Vidocq made his fame. Both these celebrated detectives were experts in the art of disguise. To quote from Vidocq's Memoirs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At last, by dint of much effort of memory, I recalled to mind one Germain, alias &quot;the Captain,&quot; who had been an intimate acquaintance of Noel's, and although our similarity was very slight, yet I determined on personating him. Germain, as well as myself, had often escaped from the Bagnes, and that was the only point of resemblance between us; he was about my age, but a smaller-framed man, he had dark brown hair, mine was light; he was thin, and I tolerably stout; his complexion was sallow, and mine fair, with a very clear skin; besides, Germain had an excessively long nose, took a vast deal of snuff which, begriming his nostrils outside, and stuffing them up within, gave him a peculiarly nasal tone of voice. I had much to do in personating Germain; but the difficulty did not deter me; my hair, cut a la mode des Bagnes, was dyed black, as well as my beard, after it had attained a growth of eight days; to embrown my countenance I washed it with white walnut liquor; and to perfect the imitation, I garnished my upper lip thickly with a kind of coffee grounds, which I plastered on by means of gum-arabic, and thus became as nasal in my twang as Germain himself. My feet were doctored with equal care; I made blisters on them by rubbing in a certain composition, of which I had obtained the receipt at Brest. I also made the marks of the fetters; and when all my toilet was finished, dressed myself in the suitable garb. I had neglected nothing which could complete the metamorphosis,—neither the shoes nor the marks of those horrid letters G.A.L. The costume was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If I were your lieutenant, and wanted to take Vidocq,&quot; replied I, &quot;I would contrive that he should not escape me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You! Oh yes, you and everybody! He is always completely armed. You know they said that he fired twice at Delrue and Carpentier; and that is not all, for he can change himself into a bundle of hay whenever he likes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A bundle of hay!&quot; cried I, surprised at the novel endowment assigned to me. &quot;A bundle of hay! How?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, sir; my father pursued him one day, and at the moment he laid his hand upon his collar, he found that he only held a handful of hay. He did not only say it, but all the brigade saw the bundle of hay, which was burnt in the barrackyard.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecoq also depends largely on disguises for his successes. He says himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A detective who is worth his salt can give an actor any amount of lessons. Since last year I have been studying the art of disguising my face, and I can at my desire become short or tall, dark or fair a perfect gentleman, or the vilest scoundrel that hangs about the outskirts of the suburbs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in &quot;File No. 113&quot; we are told:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His amazement gave so singular an expression to his face that M. Lecoq could not restrain a smile. &quot;Then it was you!&quot; continued the bewildered detective; &quot;you were the stout gentleman at whom I stared, so as to impress his appearance upon my mind, and I never recognized you! You would make a superb actor, my chief, if you would go on the stage; but I was disguised too—very well disguised.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Very poorly disguised: it is only just to you that I should let you know what a failure it was, Fanferlot. Do you think that a huge beard and a blouse are a sufficient transformation? The eye is the thing to be changed—the eye! The art lies in being able to change the eye. That is the secret.&quot; This theory of disguise explained why the lynx-eyed Lecoq never appeared at the Prefecture of Police without his gold spectacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You can't swear to that because no one can boast of knowing the real face of M. Lecoq. It is one thing today, and another tomorrow; sometimes he is a dark man, sometimes a fair one, sometimes quite young, and then an octogenarian. Why, at times he even deceives me. I begin to talk to a stranger—bah! it turns out to be M. Lecoq! Anybody on the face of the earth might be he. If I were told that you were he, I should say 'Very likely it is so.' Ah! he can convert himself into any form he pleases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He is a wonderful man!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of modern fictive detectives, few use disguise to great extent, with the exception perhaps of Frederic Larsan in the books of Gaston Leroux. So punctilious was this French detective in the details of his disguise, that his young opponent himself admitted that Larsan's disguises were impenetrable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;And Old Bob?&quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No, dear boy, no!&quot; scoffed Rouletabille, almost angrily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Not he, either. You have noticed that he wears a wig, I suppose. Well, I assure you that when Larsan wears a wig, it will fit him!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so perfectly did Larsan's wigs fit him, as well as all the other details of his disguise, that he assumed the personality of any one at will, without fear of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes often assumed disguise, but Conan Doyle does not make a strong point of it, relying not so much on physical appearances as on acute mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;other-properties&quot;&gt;Other &quot;Properties&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pet device is the discovery of a torn bit of paper containing part of a written communication. The writing is usually readable, but incomprehensible for want of context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very bunglingly done by Vidocq, who finds a torn scrap of an envelope with these words on it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Monsieur Rao—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Marchand de vins, bar—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Roche&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and after much effort, mental and otherwise, he thus solved the enigma:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The torn address was, in my estimation, an enigma, which must first be solved; and, to effect this, I racked my brains day and night and at last felt satisfied, that excepting the name (respecting which I had but few doubts) the perfect address would run thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A Monsieur—, Marchand de vins,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Barriere Rochechouart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chaussee de Clignancourt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, better managed, a torn bit of paper is helpful in rousing the reader's curiosity and there are few authors who have not utilized it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conan Doyle goes farther, in using what seems to be part of a woman's name, &quot;Rache,&quot; but is really a whole word in German.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Katharine Green gives an original twist to this old idea in her title, &quot;One of My Sons.&quot; In truth, this phrase, found on a bit of paper and pointing directly to the criminal, was really part of the line, &quot;None of my Sons.&quot; It may be seen at a glance how the intent and the evidence of this line are purposely contradictory. The detective story is essentially dramatic, and therefore picturesque incidents and sensational situations are not only permissible, but advisable. The trained reader has learned to expect them. But unless they can be novel or original, there must be a skillful handling of the old devices. Likewise, there are certain stage properties with the use of which the author should be entirely familiar, and which he should be able to employ with grace and skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Weapon, the Papers, the Jewels, the Safe, the Alibi, are all his rightful belongings. So, too, the Lens, the Desk Blotter, the Waste Basket, the Cabman, the Deserted Wing, the Inquest, and the Mistaken Identity,—all are his, to manipulate at his pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he can afford to ignore such as these, and use The Monkey's Paw, or The Speckled Band, so much the better for his originality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It cannot be denied that the greatest Detective Stories, short or long, have been written around a murder. Poe, Gaboriau, Conan Doyle, and Anna Katharine Green all look upon murder as the theme par excellence for a Detective Story, and other crimes are used by authors only as a relief from monotony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human nature thinks more lightly of robbery, or arson; but murder stirs up a spirit of righteous indignation and a desire for justice or revenge. &quot;A life for a life&quot; is the logical sequence of &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; and a murder mystery will hold a reader's interest when a lesser crime will pall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;murder-considered-in-the-abstract&quot;&gt;Murder Considered in the Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, first of all, let us dissociate the real horror felt at a real murder, from a murder plot used as a peg on which to hang the absorbing puzzle meant to enthrall the intellect. People who say, &quot;How can you enjoy reading about such a revolting subject as murder?&quot; are unable to discern the difference between a realistic newspaper story and a carefully planned romance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for reading newspaper accounts of a real murder trial are absolutely separate and distinct from the reasons for reading a Detective Story. The latter is an absorbing mental occupation, with a setting of human interest that differentiates it from a mere mathematical problem. If the reader is thrilled, it is through the intellect, not through the emotions. Sympathy is not called for; pity is not kindled; every situation is viewed by the cold light of reasoning. The whole affair is entirely divested of the sentiment that would surround it in real life. As Charles Lamb says of dramatic art:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We dare not dally with images, or names, of wrong. We bark like foolish dogs at shadows. We dread infection from the scenic representation of disorder; and fear a painted pustule. In our anxiety that our morality should not take cold, we wrap it up in a great blanket surtout of precaution against the breeze and sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I confess for myself that I am glad for a season to take an airing beyond the diocese of the strict conscience, now and then, for a dreamwhile or so, to imagine a world with no meddling restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I come back to my cage and my restraint the fresher and more healthy for it. I wear my shackles more contentedly for having respired the breath of an imaginary freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I am the gayer at least for it; and I could never connect those sports of a witty fancy in any shape with any result to be drawn from them to imitation in real life. They are a world of themselves almost as much as fairyland.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of a criminal he says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In its own world do we feel the creature is so very bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In their own sphere, they do not offend my moral sense; in fact, they do not appeal to it at all. They seem engaged in their proper element. They break through no laws, or conscientious restraints. They know of none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They have got out of Christendom into the land—what shall I call it? The Utopia of gallantry, where pleasure is duty, and the manners perfect freedom. It is altogether a speculative scene of things, which has no reference whatever to the world that is. No good person can be justly offended as a spectator, because no good person suffers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The whole is a passing pageant, where we should sit as unconcerned at the issues, for life or death, as at a battle of the frogs and mice. But like Don Quixote, we take part against the puppets, and quite as impertinently. We dare not contemplate an Atlantis, a scheme, out of which our coxcombial moral sense is for a little transitory ease excluded. We have not the courage to imagine a state of things for which there is neither reward nor punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We cling to the painful necessities of shame and blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We would indict our dreams.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a word, the reader is transported to a pleasant land of burglary and murder, which is acceptable—because it is not true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One need not be of a murderous instinct to enjoy the story of &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue.&quot; How many happily married people read stories of divorce; how many just and upright citizens read tales of men who succumb to temptation; how many strictly conventional people enjoyed &quot;Trilby.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the devotee of the Detective Story must be willing, for the time being, to look upon murder as a fine art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;murder-as-a-fine-art&quot;&gt;Murder as a Fine Art&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact point of view is perfectly set forth in De Quincey's essay with that title. I wish I might quote it all here the delicious satire that is yet sound philosophy, is marred by separation from its context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a few passages may be given:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;People begin to see that something more goes to the composition of a fine murder than two blockheads to kill and be killed—a knife—a purse—and a dark lane. Design, gentlemen, grouping, light and shade, poetry, sentiment, are now deemed indispensable to attempts of this nature. Mr. Williams has exalted the ideal of murder to all of us; and to me, therefore, in particular, has deepened the arduousness of my task. Like Aeschylus or Milton in poetry, like Michael Angelo in painting, he has carried his art to a point of colossal sublimity; and, as Mr. Wordsworth observes, has in a manner 'created the taste by which he is to be enjoyed.' To sketch the history of the art, and to examine its principles critically, now remains as a duty for the connoisseur, and forjudges of quite another stamp from his Majesty's Judges of Assize.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the right spirit in which to read of a murder in Detective Fiction. De Quincey goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The murder was a sad thing, no doubt, very sad; but we can't mend it. Therefore, let us make the best of a bad matter; and, as it is impossible to hammer any thing out of it for moral purposes, let us treat it aesthetically, and see if it will turn to account in that way. Such is the logic of a sensible man, and what follows? We dry up our tears, and have the satisfaction, perhaps, to discover that a transaction, which, morally considered, was shocking, and without a leg to stand upon, when tried by principles of Taste, turns out to be a very meritorious performance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still in his whimsical mood, De Quincey thus goes back to Ancient History:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The first murder is familiar to you all. As the inventor of murder, and the father of the art, Cain must have been a man of first-rate genius. All the Cains were men of genius. Tubal Cain invented tubes, I think, or some such thing. But, whatever might be the originality and genius of the artist, every art was then in its infancy, and the works must be criticized with a recollection of that fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even Tubal's work would probably be little approved at this day in Sheffield; and therefore of Cain (Cain senior, I mean) it is no disparagement to say, that his performance was but so-so. Milton, however, is supposed to have thought differently. By his way of relating the case, it should seem to have been rather a pet murder with him, for he retouches it with an apparent anxiety for its picturesque effect:—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#&amp;gt;'Whereat he inly raged; and, as they talk'd,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#&amp;gt;Smote him in the midriff with a stone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#&amp;gt;That beat out life: he fell; and, deadly pale&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#&amp;gt;Groan'd out his soul with gushing blood effused.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#&amp;gt;-Paradise Lost, Book XI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following history's list, we learn that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The finest work of the seventeenth century is, unquestionably, the murder of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, which has my entire approbation. In the grand feature of mystery, which in some shape or other ought to color every judicious attempt at murder, it is excellent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another excellent affair is mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The King of Sweden's assassination, by-the-by, is doubted by many writers, Harte amongst others; but they are wrong. He was murdered; and I consider his murder unique in its excellence; for he was murdered at noon-day, and on the field of battle—a feature of original conception, which occurs in no other work of art that I remember. No unpracticed artist could have conceived so bold an idea as that of a noonday murder in the heart of a great city. It was no obscure baker, gentlemen, or anonymous chimney-sweeper, be assured, that executed this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;With respect to the Williams' murders, the sublimes&quot; and most entire in their excellence that ever were committed, I shall not allow myself to speak incidentally. Nothing less than an entire lecture, or even an entire course of lectures, would suffice to expound their merits. Indeed, all of these assassinations may be studied with profit by the advanced connoisseur. They are all of them exemplaria, model murders, pattern murders of which one may say,—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;'&quot;Nocturna versate menu, versate diurna,1 especially nocturna.&quot;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing this remarkable essay, we come upon this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;But it is now time that I should say a few words about the principles of murder, not with a view to regulate your practice, but your judgment: as to old women, and the mob of newspaper readers, they are pleased with anything, provided it is bloody enough, but the mind of sensibility requires something more. First, then let us speak of the kind of person who is adapted to the purpose of the murderer; secondly, of the place where; thirdly, of the time when, and other little circumstances. &quot;As to the person, I suppose that it is evident that he ought to be a good man; because, if he were not, he might himself, by possibility, be contemplating murder at the very time; and such 'diamond-cut-diamond' tussles, though pleasant enough where nothing better is stirring, are really not what a critic can allow himself to call murders. I could mention some people (I name no names) who have been murdered by other people in a dark lane; and so far all seemed correct enough but on looking farther into the matter, the public have become aware that the murdered party was himself, at the moment, planning to rob his murderer, at the least, and possibly to murder him, if he had been strong enough. Whenever that is the case, or may be thought to be the case, farewell to all the genuine effects of the art.11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The subject chosen ought to be in good health: for it is absolutely barbarous to murder a sick person, who is usually quite unable to bear it. On this principle, no tailor ought to be chosen who is above twenty-five, for after that age he is sure to be dyspeptic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;So much for the person. As to the time, the place, the tools, I have many things to say, which at present I have no room for. The good sense of the practitioner has usually directed him to night and privacy. Yet there have not been wanting cases where this rule was departed from with excellent effect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As might be supposed, this essay of De Quincey's brought forth various criticisms. To these he replies in another essay:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A good many years age, the reader may remember that I came forward in the character of a dilettante in murder. Perhaps dilettante is too strong a word. Connoisseur is better suited to the scruples and infirmity of public taste. I suppose there is no harm in that, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A man is not bound to put his eyes, ears, and understanding into his breeches-pocket when he meets with a murder. If he is not in a downright comatose state, I suppose he must see that one murder is better or worse than another, in point of good taste. Murders have their little differences and shades of merit, as well as statues, pictures, oratorios, cameos, intaglios, or what not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I am for morality, and always shall be, and for virtue, and all that; and I do affirm and always shall (let what will come of it), that murder is an improper line of conduct, highly improper; and I do not stick to assert, that any man who deals in murder, must have very incorrect ways of thinking, and truly inaccurate principles; and so far from aiding and abetting him by pointing out his victim's hiding place, as a great moralist of Germany declared it to be every good man's duty to do, I would subscribe one shilling and sixpence to have him apprehended, which is more by eighteen pence than the most eminent moralists have hitherto subscribed for that purpose. But what then? Everything in this world has two handles. Murder, for instance, may be laid hold of by its moral handle (as it generally is in the pulpit, and at the Old Bailey); and that, I confess, is its weak side; or it may also be treated aesthetically, as the Germans call it—that is, in relation to good taste. Genius may do much, but long study of the art must always entitle a man to offer advice. So far I will go—general principles I will suggest. But as to any particular case, once for all I will have nothing to do with it. Never tell me of any special work of art you are meditating—I set my face against it in toto. For, if once a man indulges himself in murder, very soon he comes to think little of robbing; and from robbing he comes next to drinking and Sabbath-breaking, and from that to incivility and procrastination. Once begin upon this downward path, you never know where you are to stop. Many a man has dated his ruin from some murder or other that perhaps he thought little of at the time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though written in a whimsical vein, these observations of De Quincey apply definitely to the Murder Fanciers of Detective Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shakespeare's murders are calmly accepted on the stage, and our children are placidly told Who Killed Cock Robin because these killings are not true, but are merely the manufactures of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-murder-theme&quot;&gt;The Murder Theme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a proof that murder, or apparent murder, or attempted murder, is the favorite theme with our best detective writers, we may note these statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the two-score-odd Sherlock Holmes stories, more than twenty have murder as the crime; and this, in spite of his assertion in &quot;The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle&quot; that &quot;there are many interesting little problems for detectives which are striking and bizarre without being criminal.&quot; Yet in more than half of his stories, Conan Doyle uses a murder motive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of Poe's three Dupin stories, two are based on murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacques Futrelle in his clever &quot;Thinking Machine&quot; stories, employs murder as an interest in eight out of nineteen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of Samuel Gardenhire's eight stories in &quot;The Long Arm,&quot; five are murder stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so on, through all the books of short stories, each volume of which narrates the exploits of a Transcendent Detective, the average of the murder plot is more than one- half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Novels of detective fiction almost invariably use a murder plot. &quot;The Moonstone&quot; is an exception; but nearly all of Gaboriau's, Du Boisgobey's, Anna Katharine Green's and Ottolengui's are murder mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-robbery-theme&quot;&gt;The Robbery Theme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After murder, robbery is next in favor as a crime for detective fiction. It is not easy to create intense interest in a robbery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Sir Walter Besant on this subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Consider—say, a diamond robbery. Very well; then first of all, it must be a robbery committed under exceptional any mysterious conditions, otherwise there will be no interest in it. Also, you will perceive that the robbery must be a big and important thing—no little shop-lifting business. Next, the person robbed must not be a mere diamond merchant, but a person whose loss will interest the reader, say, one to whom the robbery is all-important.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These conditions are all perfectly observed in &quot;The Moonstone. Indeed, so well did Wilkie Collins know that the jewel must be of not only enormous but peculiar value, that he thus describes it, through the medium of the old House Steward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Lord bless us! It was a Diamond! As large, or nearly, as a plover's egg! The light that streamed from it was like the light of the harvest-moon. When you looked down into the stone, you looked into a yellow deep that drew your eyes into it so that they saw nothing else. It seemed unfathomable; this jewel, that you could hold between your finger and thumb, seemed unfathomable as the heavens themselves. We set it in the sun, and then shut the light out of the room, and it shone awfully out of the depths of its own brightness, with a moony gleam, in the dark. No wonder Miss Rachel was fascinated; no wonder her cousins screamed. The Diamond laid such a hold on me that I burst out with as large an 'O!1 as the Bouncers themselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even before this description, the Diamond had been given a value quite other than intrinsic. It was a historic gem famous in the native annals of India. It was the subject of tradition and superstition, and it had been having adventures since the eleventh century. It had been the reason for theft and bloodshed, and was the cause of a family feud. All this interest in addition to the setting of the story, the personality of the characters and the adroit art of Wilkie Collins, causes the mystery to be a worth-while one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A later story of a jewel robbery is found in Robert Barr's book, called &quot;The Triumphs of Eugene Valmont.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story is built around a diamond necklace which a court jeweler made, hoping to sell to Marie Antoinette. It contained half a thousand marvelous stones and had been through desperate adventures for many years. After its thrilling history is narrated the necklace is thus introduced to the reader:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The jeweler who made the necklace met with financial ruin; the Queen for whom it was constructed was beheaded; that high-born prince, Louis Rene Edouard, Cardinal de Rohan, who purchased it, was flung into prison; the unfortunate countess, who said she acted as go- between until the transfer was concluded, clung for five awful minutes to a London window sill before dropping to her death to the flags below; and now, a hundred and eight years later, up comes this devil's display of fireworks to the light again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These preliminaries, though so similar to those employed in &quot;The Moonstone,&quot; are in no sense a plagiarism. They are the legitimate methods of whetting the reader's interest in a robbery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaboriau's &quot;File No. 113&quot; hinges on a robbery. This, a bank robbery, is not a great one, the sum of $70,000 being stolen. But the popularity of the story is caused by the skill of the detective Lecoq and the contrasting inefficiency of a younger detective in unraveling the complicated web of circumstances. As is usual with Gaboriau, the story is spun out to a tiresome length; and the simple plot of the robbery, the clue of the scratch on the safe and the mixed-up social relations of the characters are presented as a novel, when they are barely enough material for a novelette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robberies other than of jewels or money are sometimes thefts of valuable papers. These papers are often of political import, and not infrequently are of such nature that their falling into wrong hands would precipitate dire and disastrous war among the greatest of the world's powers. Naval treatises, war maps, or specifications for astonishing new inventions in the way of explosives, are among the most used sorts, followed closely by wills, love letters, photographs, and, in one instance at least, college examination papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe's &quot;Purloined Letter&quot; is the first and best of these stories; but the value of that masterpiece is more in the work of the detective than in the actual situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conan Doyle's &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; is a similar plot with an incriminating photograph for the booty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theft stories are built, too, around antiques or curios, idols, heirlooms, and, especially since the disappearance of the Mona Lisa, around valuable paintings. There was even a very clever and original story written about the theft of the Venus of Milo from the Louvre; and this some years before the abstraction of the Mona Lisa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any article will do for fiction robbery, provided it be of exceeding great value, either intrinsically or by association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Sherlock Holmes stories, one-quarter hinge on robbery as against one-half on murder. Next in favor is mysterious disappearance, or abduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-mysterious-disappearance&quot;&gt;The Mysterious Disappearance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kidnapping of children is unpopular, as it is difficult to eliminate personal feeling when a child is brought into the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samuel N. Gardenhire thus refers to it in &quot;The Abduction of Mary Ellis&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The stealing of children,&quot; he said, reflectively, &quot;is probably the most unpopular crime that can be committed in this country. It is not indigenous to the soil. It is an exotic—an imported offence, one that has best thriven in communities where the poor are oppressed by the rich and where the element of revenge is combined with the instinct of greed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Millionaire Baby,&quot; by Anna Katharine Green, is perhaps a unique instance of a full-sized book with a kidnapping case for its theme. But treated by this skillful author it is in all respects a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the Luther Trant stories, a kidnapping mystery is well solved in &quot;The Red Dress&quot;; and in &quot;The Master of Mysteries,&quot; Astro happily rescues a kidnapped child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes' nearest approach to a child-stealing case is the tracing of a missing school-boy in &quot;The Adventure of the Priory School.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abduction of older girls, or young women, is more often narrated, &quot;The Strange Disappearance of Eleanor Cuyler,&quot; and &quot;A Mysterious Disappearance,&quot; by Anna Katharine Green, being among the best examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mysterious disappearance, though not necessarily abduction, is always a useful theme. In &quot;The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor,&quot; Sherlock Holmes remarks thus on the disappearance of a bride during her own wedding breakfast:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Before the what?&quot; asked Holmes with a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The vanishing of the lady.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;When did she vanish, then?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;At the wedding breakfast.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic in fact.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honey-moon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man is abducted in &quot;The Adventure of the Missing Three- Quarter,&quot; value being given to this particular man because he is a three-quarter in a celebrated football team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other authors average much the same as Conan Doyle; and, to sum up, we find that throughout Detective Fiction half of the stories are murder mysteries, one quarter are robberies, and the other quarter is divided among crimes more or less dramatic or picturesque. These include forgery, counterfeiting, blackmail, arson, dynamiting, body-snatching, and other rare and even unique crimes invented by a daring author for a jaded public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detective of modern fiction is a combination of the stock principles already noticed with such further and varying characteristics as the author may invent. In so far as the personal traits of the detective can differ from Sherlock Holmes, the author is so far less liable to the charge of plagiarism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;some-original-traits&quot;&gt;Some Original Traits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of how one of the later writers has invested his detective with fresh qualities may be noted in this extract from &quot;Midnight at Mears House,11 by Harrison J. Holt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the time of his coming to Mears House, Garth looked very much as he does to-day—a short, slight man of about my own age, well-built and energetic, but of a nervous rather than a muscular type of energy. He has grown a trifle stouter since, to be sure, but otherwise I can see little change in him. He was as bald then as he is now, and had the same trick of carrying his head a little to one side, as though the weight of it were too much for his neck to support. I have never seen a head more beautifully shaped than his, with a wide, high forehead, dark eyes far apart and rather prominent—it was hard to believe them blind—the nose and chin of an old Roman Emperor, and a somewhat small but finely modelled mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His ears, however, were the most remarkable of his features—not that they were unusual in shape or size, but because they were so low as to appear almost misplaced, and on account of their extraordinary quality. I doubt if anyone was ever gifted with a more wonderful sense of hearing. Certainly I have never met anybody, even among those bom blind, who could distinguish and interpret sound with such unerring, almost uncanny skill. Without this power—which he had developed to an altogether incredible degree—he could never have achieved the results he did: he has told me so many times. The tiniest noises, unremarked or meaningless to most people, were packed with significance to him. Each registered its own distinct, unequivocal impression, producing an emotion or resulting in a co-ordination of ideas which often enabled him to arrive instantly at the most momentous conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Especially was this the case in regard to the tones, inflection, and timbre of the human voice. From these he was able to deduct an astonishingly large number of facts concerning the person speaking—such as his age, nationality, occupation, physical and mental state of health, disposition, and character. This, as I am well aware, may strike the reader as fanciful and even preposterous. It seemed so to me at first, and yet I learned later that to a lesser degree this power of divination was no uncommon thing among the blind, though I have heard of very few instances in which it proved so uniformly infallible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I should not forget to mention as well a veritable sixth sense which he possessed—a sort of clairvoyance which made up in great measure for his lost sight. And yet clairvoyance is hardly the right word to describe it. It was rather as if he had some strange invisible organ of sensibility, some occult medium, by means of which he became aware of things seemingly beyond his apprehension. Doubtless a psychologist could state it far more intelligibly; I can only repeat that he had some such way of sensitizing himself, as it were, so as to receive impressions not communicable through the ordinary channels of the senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just how much this faculty, combined with his marvellously developed hearing, has aided him in his work, it would be hard to say. Personally I think he overestimates its value to him, and underrates the part his brain has played in the mastering of these abstruse problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Without a very high degree of mental acuteness, the clearest and soundest of reasoning powers, and what-for want of a better word—I must call a sympathetic imagination, his unusual psychical and auditory perceptions would, I feel sure, have been of little help to him. It is, in my opinion, far more to the brilliant qualities of his mind, his marked analytical and synthetical abilities, and his unrivalled skill as a constructive logician, that he chiefly owes his success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, some authors try to give their detectives prominence by using methods exactly opposite to those of Sherlock Holmes. LeDroit Conners, in Samuel Gardenhire's book, &quot;The Long Arm,&quot; thus asserts his confidence in himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You cannot understand how strongly such matters appeal to me. It is a faculty with me almost to know the solution of a crime when the leading circumstances connected with it are revealed. I form my conclusion first, and, confident of its correctness, hunt for evidence to sustain it. I do this because I am never wrong. It is not magic, telepathy, nor any form of mental science; it is a moral consciousness of the meaning of related facts, impressed upon my mind with unerring certainty.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I do not understand you,&quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;When I am given certain figures,&quot; he replied, &quot;the process of addition is instantaneous and sure. So, when I know of established incidents relating to a matter, they group themselves in my mind in such a manner as to reveal to me their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You say a gift developed; perhaps. Rather an instinct, as the faculty of scent to the blood-hound and the acute ear to the hare, an unfailing sight to the hawk and a sense of touch to the serpent. Deductive knowledge depends on reason, but inspiration is an exalted—no, perhaps I should say an acute sense of something else. The beasts, unclothed except by nature and unfed except by season and conquest, must make existence out of an absolute impression of certainty that is neither analytical nor deductive. I fear I am in that category, my dear fellow. I know things because I know them—that is, some things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is decidedly in contrast to Holmes' statement,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Now I make a point of never having any prejudices, and of following docilely wherever fact may lead me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foregoing is in line with this bit of Poe's wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The mass of the people regard as profound only him who suggests pungent contradictions of the general idea. In ratiocination, not less than in literature, it is the epigram which is the most immediately and the most universally appreciated. In both, it is of the lowest order of merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What I mean to say is, that it is the mingled epigram and melodrama of the idea that Marie Roget still lives, rather than any true plausibility in this idea, which have suggested it to L'Etoile.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burton E. Stevenson works on this principle when his detective in &quot;The Holladay Case&quot; says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I think we're too apt to overlook the simple explanations, which are, after all, nearly always the true ones. It's only in books that we meet the reverse. You remember it's Gaboriau who advises one always to distrust the probable?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes. I don't agree with him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Nor I.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is a dangerous experiment for inexperienced authors to put forward views heterodox to the accepted laws of Detective Fiction, and it must be done with skill and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Luther Trant's work, his scientific apparatus enables him to dispense with the more usual methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No, thank you,&quot; he said, refusing the proffer of the paper. &quot;I read from the marks made upon minds by a crime, not from scrawls and thumbprints upon paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And my means of reading those marks are fortunately in my possession this morning. No, I do not mean that I have other evidence upon this case than that you have just given me, Mr. Eldredge,&quot; Trant explained. &quot;I refer to my psychological apparatus which, the express company notified me, arrived from New York this morning. If you will let me have my appliance delivered direct to your house it will save much time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;two-unique-detectives&quot;&gt;Two Unique Detectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rouletabille appreciated the dramatic value of what Poe called the pungent contradiction of the general idea. In &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,11 by Gaston Leroux, the following conversation occurs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Have you any idea as to the murderer's station in life?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied; &quot;I think if he isn't a man in society, he is, at least, a man belonging to the upper class. But that, again, is only an impression.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What has led you to form it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,—the greasy cap, the common handkerchief, and the marks of the rough boots on the floor,&quot; he replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I understand,&quot; I said; &quot;murderers don't leave traces behind them which tell the truth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We shall make something out of you yet, my dear Sain- clair,&quot; concluded Rouletabille.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Lecoq, this young man was not infallible; but his author made him this way for the same reason. Because he figures in a novel, and the infallible detective must do his work in a short- story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rouletabille's strong card is pure reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;How did you come to suspect Larsan?&quot; asked the President.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;My pure reason pointed to him. But I did not foresee the drugging. He is very cunning. Yes, my pure reason pointed to him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you mean by your pure reason?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;That power of one's mind which admits of no disturbing elements to a conclusion. The day following the incident of 'the inexplicable gallery,' I felt myself losing control of it.        I had allowed myself to be diverted by fallacious evidence; but I recovered and again took hold of the right end.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, he says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;M. Sainclair, you ought to know that I never suspect any person or anything without previously having satisfied myself upon the 'ground of pure reason.1 That is a solid staff which has never yet failed me on the toad and on which I invite you all to lean with me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His pure reason is of the subtlest variety, and his fine work throughout the book commands always the admiration of the connoisseur. In a seemingly inexplicable situation he exclaims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Let us reason it out!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And he returned on the instant to that argument which lad already served us and which he repeated again and again to himself (in order that, he said, he should not be lured away by the outer appearance of things): &quot;Do not look for Larsan in that place where he reveals himself; seek for him everywhere else where he hides himself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This he followed up with the supplementary argument:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;He never shows himself where he seems to be except to prevent us from seeing him where he really is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And he resumed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah! the outer appearance of things! Look here. Sain- clair! There are moments when, for the sake of reasoning clearly, I want to get rid of my eyes! Let us get rid of our eyes, Sainclair, for five minutes—just five minutes, and, perhaps, we shall see more clearly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rouletabille's subtlety of reasoning rose almost to clairvoyance. In his desperate endeavors to discover the identity of Larsan, he relates his experience thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;And why did all the others sit so silent and so motionless behind their dark glasses? All at once, I turned my head and looked behind me. Then I understood, more by instinct than anything else, that I was the object of a common physical attraction. Someone was looking at me. Two eyes were fixed upon me—weighing upon me. I could not see the eyes and I did not know from where the glance fixed upon me came, but it was there. I knew it—and it was his glance. But there was no one behind me, nor at the right, nor the left, nor in front, except the people who were seated at the table, motionless, behind their dark glasses. And then—then I knew that Larsan's eyes were glaring at me from behind a pair of those glasses—ah! the dark glasses,—the dark glasses behind which were hidden Larsan's eyes. If I mention this incident here, it is for the purpose of showing to how great an extent I was haunted by the image of Larsan, hiding under some new form, and lurking unknown among us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear Heaven! Larsan had so often proved his talent—I may even say his genius—in this respect, that I felt that he was quite capable of defying us now, and of mingling with us while we thought that he was a stranger—or, perhaps, even a friend.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So fearful is he that one of the seemingly well-known people about him may be Larsan in disguise, that he says to Sainclair:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hold your left hand in your right for five minutes and then ask yourself: 'Is it you, Larsan?' And when you have replied to yourself, do not feel too sure, for he may, perhaps, have lied to you, and he may be in your own skin without your knowing it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing imitative about this young detective. His methods are unique. His pure reasoning is most subtle; and though the farthest possible remove from realism it presents a semblance of reality that is entirely convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Whispering Man&quot; Mr. Henry Kitchell Webster employs a very different principle for the use of his detective. It may be called the principle of The Inspired Guess, and though improbable, perhaps not more so than the laws of detective fiction permit. The Whispering Man thus describes it himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I had happened to tell him once that I believed that I always knew a criminal when I saw one, without knowing how or why—by just looking at him. He didn't scout that theory as you would if I were to give you a chance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;And you believed all the while,&quot; I repeated, incredulously, &quot;that McWilliams was the man?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Not believed; knew. Oh, I don't know how. That's the whole point. That's what I've been preaching all the evening. The only certain knowledge is the inspired guess.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most remarkable Detectives of Fiction is Mr. Zangwill's Grodman, who in &quot;Big Bow Mystery,&quot; thus discourses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It grew daily clearer to me that criminals were more fools than rogues. Every crime I had traced, however cleverly perpetrated, was from the point of view of penetrability a weak failure. Traces and trails were left on all sides—ragged edges, rough-hewn corners; in short, the job was botched, artistic completeness unattained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To the vulgar, my feats might seem marvelous—the average man is mystified to grasp how you detect the letter 'e1 in a simple cryptogram—to myself they were as commonplace as the crimes they unveiled. To me now, with my lifelong study of the science of evidence, it seemed possible to commit not merely one, but a thousand crimes that should be absolutely undiscoverable. And yet criminals would go on sinning, and giving themselves away, in the same old grooves—no originality, no dash, no individual insight, no fresh conception! One would imagine there were an Academy of crime with forty thousand armchairs. And gradually, as I pondered and brooded over the thought, there came upon me the desire to commit a crime that should baffle detection. I could invent hundreds of such crimes, and please myself by imagining them done but would they really work out in practice? Evidently the sole performer of my experiment must be myself; the subject whom or what? Accident should determine. I itched to commence with murder—to tackle the stiffest problems first, and I burned to startle and baffle the world—especially the world of which I had ceased to be. Outwardly I was calm, and spoke to the people about me as usual. Inwardly I was on fire with a consuming scientific passion. I sported with my pet theories, and fitted them mentally on every one I met. Every friend or acquaintance I sat and gossiped with, I was plotting how to murder without leaving a clue. There is not one of my friends or acquaintances I have not done away with in thought. There is no public man—have no fear, my dear Home Secretary—I have not planned to assassinate secretly, mysteriously, unintelligibly, undiscoverably. Ah, how I could give the stock criminals points with their second-hand motives, their conventional conceptions, their commonplace details, their lack of artistic feeling and restraint.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the same book, we get this description of the contrasting official detective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wimp was at his greatest in collecting circumstantial evidence; in putting two and two together to make five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He would collect together a number of dark and disconnected data and flash across them the electric light of some unifying hypothesis in a way which would have done credit to a Darwin or a Faraday. An intellect which might have served to unveil the secret workings of nature was subverted to the protection of a capitalistic civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admitting that, according to a consensus of opinion, a murder mystery makes the most interesting plot for a Detective Story, let us consider the characters that necessarily belong to such a plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-victim&quot;&gt;The Victim&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Quincey has pointed out, in his entertaining essay, that the victim of the crime should be selected with great care. Let us then, in planning our story, first decide upon the victim. Shall we choose a man or a woman—old or young?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A favorite victim with the writers of Detective Fiction is an elderly man, perhaps a banker, or some other wealthy citizen of importance to the community. This is a reasonable choice, for the character has the regard and interest of his fellow townsmen, without too great sympathy on the part of the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, a charming young woman may be chosen for this role, but in this case the reader must not be allowed to know and love her before the tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point to be remembered by the author is that the victim must be of the greatest possible importance generally, yet not specifically in the sympathy of the reader. Indeed, the victim, if beautiful or worthy, must be almost or entirely a stranger to the reader. But if the victim be wicked or unattractive, it matters not how great the reader's acquaintance with him. In a word, the reader must be averse to or indifferent to the victim, in order that he-may be satisfied with the conditions of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly Poe reached the height of perfection in his choice, when he selected a mother and a daughter for the victims of the &quot;Rue Morgue.&quot; What could be more dramatic? And yet as the reader knew nothing and never learned anything of these two people except their names, casually named in a newspaper report, he could not feel a personal grief at their death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We accept the deceased gentleman of Doyle's &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; or the murdered bride of Green's &quot;The Filigree Ball&quot; or the brutally-assassinated &quot;Widow Lerouge&quot; by Ga- boriau, because they are all strangers to us, and we know they are a necessary part, indeed, the very foundation of the machinery of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So guard against introducing the victim too long before the murder, or allowing him or her to engage too deeply the reader's sympathy or admiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not so likely to be the case in a short-story as in a novel. There are few, if any, of Conan Doyle's victims for whom we have any personal feeling whatever. Indeed, they are usually dead when the story begins, unless the problem may be a matter of preventing the crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select your victim for his or her intrinsic worth or prominence and the sympathetic interest he or she may have for the other characters of the story, but not for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Leavenworth Case&quot; and &quot;Hand and Ring,&quot; these principles are strictly observed. In &quot;The Big Bow Mystery,&quot; the horrible deed is committed on a man we know nothing of, and one who is quite as much a lay figure as is a tailor's dummy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; the victim is a beautiful young woman who has our entire sympathy and admiration, but the situation is saved because she is not really killed in the attempt at murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An occasional device is to have the victim apparently a good and kind old gentleman, most foully murdered. But later it transpires that the seemingly good and kind victim was in reality a very bad man, and was killed in justice and righteous indignation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conan Doyle as a rule makes his victim an inconspicuous and even uninteresting character—oftenest, perhaps, a bad old man. When, as in the case of &quot;The Speckled Band,&quot; the intended victim is a young woman, the tragedy is whisked around and the villain proves to be the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is entirely legitimate and advisable. The ideal victim is one in whom we have no personal interest, but whose importance we easily recognize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-criminal&quot;&gt;The Criminal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next character to be chosen must be our criminal. Here again is one, who, if he is to be convicted, must not be too deeply in the reader's sympathy. And yet he must be a worthwhile character; it is old-fashioned, now, to have the crime committed by the butler or the private secretary. The drawing of the criminal calls for fine shading and strong effects. He must be both intelligent and ingenious, in order to give the Transcendent Detective a foeman worthy of his steel. The reader must have no liking or pity for him. In his perfection he should be what Poe calls, &quot;that monstrum horrendum, an unprincipled man of genius.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, he must be cleverly drawn in order to conceal his identity from the reader until the last. He must appear to be what he is not, and he must not appear to be what he is; and this calls for Machiavelian cunning on the part of both criminal and author. The identity of the criminal, disclosed at the last, must be the greatest surprise of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is marvellously well accomplished in &quot;Hand and Ring&quot; and &quot;Big Bow Mystery.&quot; In both these books the reader cannot possibly guess the criminal, although he is inconspicuously in plain view from the very beginning. But so adroitly is his identity concealed and so definitely is he made to appear what he is not, that detection by the reader is not possible. To be sure, in neither book is the motive so much as hinted at until the final disclosures, and this is not quite in accordance with the unwritten law of the Detective Story. But it is forgivable in the books mentioned, because of their splendid workmanship and original plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Leavenworth Case,&quot; written many years ago, we have one of the earliest and best examples of the private secretary criminal. Here, too, he is before our eyes from the very beginning, yet we suspect everyone else in the book before we think of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;faulty-portrayal-of-the-criminal&quot;&gt;Faulty Portrayal of the Criminal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaboriau was at fault in this matter in the &quot;Widow Lerouge.&quot; By the time we are half through the book and long before any hint of the true state of affairs is necessary, we are forced to the inevitable conclusion of the guilt of Noel, start ling as that theory seems on its face, simply because Noel is the only possible person who has consistently avoided being the object of suspicion. A still greater mistake is when during the course of a story every character is at some time suspected and then cleared of suspicion, and at the end we learn that the crime is committed by a person of whom we have never heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conan Doyle employs this hitherto unknown criminal frequently. Usually he is some old man who had known and quarreled with his old friend, the victim, many years before. For instance, in &quot;The Adventure of Black Peter&quot; and in &quot;The Five Orange Pips,&quot; these are the circumstances. But Conan Doyle's motive is the exploitation of the powers of his Transcendent Detective in discovering the unheard-of criminal, and so in his case the end justified the means. But ordinarily, and especially in a book, it is bad workmanship to absent the criminal from the scene until the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the criminal of the Rue Morgue murders, it is ill-advised to have a freakish or a superhuman agency. The imitators of Poe's masterpiece have not been successful, though many have impressed members of the Simian tribe into their service as criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal criminal is a sane, respectable and well-educated man, like Lawyer Orcutt, or Mr. Grodman. Such as these escape the reader's suspicion by seeming to belong among the reputable characters of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-secondary-detective&quot;&gt;The Secondary Detective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Transcendent Detective being of such importance as to require a chapter to himself, we come next to the sub ordinate detective. He is usually a Central Office Man, or a young reporter, or a lawyer with a taste for detective work. He serves as a foil for the higher detective's glories. He makes mistakes for the other to correct. He starts false trails to lead the reader astray and to give the superior detective opportunity to scoff at him and to set him right. This character may not be a detective at all, but simply a &quot;Greek Chorus,&quot; like Dr. Watson, or like Hutchinson Hatch in &quot;The Thinking Machine,&quot; or Walter Jameson in the &quot;Silent Bullet.&quot; But usually this character is a detective who variously hinders or assists, as Sweetwater with Mr. Gryce, or Mr. Barnes with Mr. Mitchel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This secondary detective character is, at times and quite effectively, a woman. In &quot;That Affair Next Door&quot; this role is taken by Miss Amelia Butterworth, who is also the teller of the story. In &quot;The Master of Mysteries,&quot; Astro is aided and abetted in his charlatanry by a beautiful young woman called Valeska. In a clever series of stories called &quot;Tales from the Red Ledger,&quot; the Transcendent Detective is helped at times by a mysterious and vaguely-pictured woman known as &quot;The Orchid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But invariably it is a good device to have a major and a minor detective character, that by comparison or contrast their leads and misleads may further the author's ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suspects are highly important characters in our Detective Story. They appear one after another, few or many, according to the length of the story. As each suspect is brought forward, the reader must be made to feel certain that this is the criminal. Then a doubt is raised or positive innocence is shown, and the next suspect is brought forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a tale of simple construction, the suspects will come forward, a, b, c, d. The first three are eventually proved innocent and D is the criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more complex plot would have D wrongly accused and proved innocent and show that, after all, C was the criminal. In this case the reader must be made to insist to himself that he knew it was C all the time, even though the case looked pretty black against D. Or, a clever dodge is to suspect the characters in order, and though A was exonerated long ago, prove at the last that he was the real criminal after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the variations of these plans that make for interest in a Detective Story, and the characterization of these suspects has much to do with the success of the plot. The breathless fear that the criminal may be the beautiful but headstrong young woman; the ever rising suspicion that the criminal is the handsome, manly hero; the lurking doubt of the nephew who inherits; the distrust of certain old family servants all these serve to keep interest alive and curiosity piqued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal characteristics, then, of our criminal must be his own importance, his dramatic personality, and his successful concealment until the denouement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rules are not inflexible for short-stories, where there is less room for characterization than in books. The criminals in Conan Doyle's stories, like the victims, have little personality, because the fierce light that beats upon Sherlock Holmes leaves most of the other characters in shadow. But in a full- sized novel, where characterization is an important factor of the workmanship, the criminal's make-up is of vital importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-heroine-and-the-element-of-romance&quot;&gt;The Heroine and the Element of Romance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the advisability of a heroine, authorities differ. The true economy of the Detective Story forbids the introduction of romance, especially in short-stories. The purists hold that the single-minded artist in detective fiction must not introduce two kinds of interest, for they can seldom be so perfectly balanced that one or the other shall not surer. The mind of the reader does not wish to jump continually from the solution of the problem to a love interest, and back again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some writers deem it necessary to introduce a charming young woman who has little to do with the story, and who invariably marries the subordinate detective. The truth is, the magazine editors are largely to blame for this use of romance. In their inexorable demand for &quot;a happy ending,&quot; they insist upon those wedding bells at the end of the story, that their joyful peals may drown the sound of the sentence pronounced on the criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Poe and Conan Doyle and all their worth-while successors omit the element of romance, except where it is an inherent part of the plot. Otherwise, romance in a Detective Story is wasteful and ridiculous excess. The whole intent of the problem and its solution is to engage the attention of the reader to the very utmost, and if this be successfully done, the reader has no nook or comer of his attention vacant to accommodate this love interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if, as in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia,&quot; the beautiful woman is an integral part of the story, then she may be introducer and expatiated upon at the pleasure of the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the story just referred to, this point is marvelously well taken in these opening words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen; but, as a lover, he would have placed himself in a false position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer-excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intuitions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high- power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though expressing it strongly, it is true that extraneous romance in a Detective Story is like grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in a high-power lens. But, of course, in a novel or even a novelette the case is altered. Here we require a setting of picturesque complexity. And a love interest, properly managed, and woven into the mystery plot is almost a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the introduction of the feminine element in a Detective Story is subject to certain and definite rules. A victim she may be, a suspect she may be, but only in rare cases and when exceptionally well done, should she be the criminal. As a suspect, a feminine character gives opportunity for sympathetic thrills, but the experienced reader of detective stories feels fairly sure that an attractive feminine suspect is not the real criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-police&quot;&gt;The Police&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the police force are inevitable characters in Detective Fiction and have been presented in every possible light from a realistic picture of the actual Inspector to the ignorant and fanciful author's conception of the same. As these strong arms of the law must appear on our pages, let us endeavor to know whereof we speak, and learn a few simple and primitive facts about these people before we endeavor to portray them. It is amusing to read some of the absurd effects given to these clearly defined and easily recognized American citizens. Make them as picturesque as possible; give them dramatic, even humorous personality, but do not endow them with absurd responsibilities or official powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-supernumeraries&quot;&gt;The Supernumeraries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the supernumerary characters, the author must exercise his own taste and judgment, and he has fine scope for both. Of less importance in a short-story, they require merely to be kept in the background; but in a novel, they have their exits and their entrances, and play many, though subordinate parts. Each of these characters must have a positive and definite reason for being, and, if at all prominent, must be an inherent part of the plot. They are not to be scamped or slurred over in workmanship, for they are as important a part of the whole as the setting of a jewel or the binding of a book. They are the pence of a Detective Story, and must be taken care of; though in this case it does not follow that the pounds will take care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-plot-is-the-story&quot;&gt;The Plot is the Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, the detective story, short or long, has but one plot—the problem and its solution. No matter what elaboration may be introduced, the skeleton of the plot is the same; and it is this simplicity of construction, this straight and narrow path of procedure, that makes the writing of detective stories both easy and hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Bliss Perry eliminates the necessity in some stories, and by some writers for any characterization or setting whatever. He says, in &quot;A Study of Prose Fiction:&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If its plot be sufficiently entertaining, comical, novel, thrilling, the characters may be the merest lay figures and yet the story remains an admirable work of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Poe's tales of ratiocination, as he loved to call them, like &quot;The Gold Bug,&quot; &quot;The Purloined Letter,&quot; or his tales of pseudo-science, like &quot;A Descent into the Maelstrom,&quot; are dependent for none of their power upon any interest attaching to character. The exercise of the pure logical faculty, or the wonder and the terror of the natural world, gives scope enough for that consummate craftsman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in his &quot;Talks on Writing English&quot; Arlo Bates observes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There is a crude popular idea that the refinements of literary art are wasted, at any rate upon the general reader. So many books succeed, at least temporarily, which can make no slightest pretence to any grace of manner, and which have not even the merit of reasonable accuracy, that the student is apt to feel that these things are superfluous.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we have shown earlier in the book that while a detective story, even if poorly written, may interest and amuse, it is not literature unless it shows that superiority of intellectual attainment demanded by the critics or scholars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constructing the Plot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But referring now to the plot, let the young writer be careful that he plans his story with absolute logic and sequence. Poe tells us that it was his &quot;design to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is referable either to accident or intuition; that the work proceeded, step by step, to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical problem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We accept Poe as the master in this field of fiction, and we can do no better than to study both his own stories and his essays in criticism of them. He makes this definite statement regarding the plotting of a story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Nothing is more clear than that every plot, worth the name, must be elaborated to its denouement before anything be attempted with the pen. It is only with the denouement constantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of consequence, or causation, by making the incidents, and especially the tone at all points, tend to the development of the intention.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In building a story, then, let us construct it entirely from start to finish before beginning its actual diction. Construct the plot backward, if need be; but see to it that every incident and every episode, every speech of the characters and every hint of the author have their direct bearing on the statement of the problem or the quest of its solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is another valuable point in construction given us by Poe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The design of mystery, however, being once determined upon by an author, it becomes imperative, first that no undue or inartistical means be employed to conceal the secret of the plot; and, secondly, that the secret be well kept. Now, when, at page 16, we read that &quot;the body of poor Mr. Rudge, the steward, was found&quot; months after the outrage, etc., we see that Mr. Dickens has been guilty of no misdemeanor against art in stating what was not the fact; since the falsehood is put into the mouth of Solomon Daisy, and given merely as the impression of thus individual and of the public. The writer has not asserted it in his own person, but ingeniously conveyed an idea (false in itself, yet a belief in which is necessary for the effect of the tale) by the mouth of one of his characters. The case is different, however, when Mrs. Rudge is repeatedly denominated &quot;the widow.&quot; It is the author who, himself, frequently so terms her. This is disingenuous and inartistical; accidentally so, of course.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exactly parallel idea to this may be noticed in &quot;The Leavenworth Case.&quot; Harwell, the private secretary, is a witness at the inquest. Also, he is the murderer. In the very beginning of the book the question is put to him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You are the person who last saw Mr. Leavenworth alive, are you not?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are then told that the young man raised his head with a haughty gesture that well nigh transfigured it, and replied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Certainly not; as I am not the man who killed him!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, he was the man who killed him, and had the author told the reader he was not, it would have been infringing on the rights of the reader. But it is perfectly legitimate that the character in the book should make this false statement, by way of not incriminating himself. By this device the reader is not only convinced that this Harwell is innocent, but feels a warming sympathy toward the suspected man. Harwell's status now being established in the reader's mind, as that of injured innocence, he is at liberty to figure prominently all through the book, yet never arouse the reader's sleeping suspicion until the author so wills it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is a strong one to a conscientious writer of detective fiction—to learn at the end of the volume that the real culprit is the person who has been before you throughout, but whom you never have dreamed of suspecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Katharine Green is an adept in the use of this plan, and surpasses most other writers in her ability to carry her unsuspected criminal straight through the book to the last page. In reading &quot;Hand and Ring,&quot; who would guess that Lawyer Orcutt was the murderer of Mrs. Clemmens? The thrilling story goes on, and the reader successively suspects Hildreth, Mansell, or any character in the book rather than Orcutt, the grave and aristocratic lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this surprise, when at last the identity of the criminal is learned, that is the crux of the Detective Story. Observation and deduction, though important in interest, are side issues of the plot—which must bend all else to the final surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Whispering Man,&quot; who would guess or even deduce that the clever detective is himself the criminal? Note how deftly he is introduced to the reader, because &quot;he is destined to play a large and most romantic part in the solution of the mystery, and his queer, brilliant, eccentric personality is to appear very often in the ensuing pages.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this hint gives the reader no suspicion that the man thus introduced is really the criminal, nor does he suspect it until the very last. This book is rather more subtly constructed than &quot;Hand and Ring,&quot; in that the motive for the crime is shown in the beginning of the book; though so skilfully veiled that even an experienced reader might be excused for not discerning it. The author, Henry Kitchell Webster, calls this his favorite of all the books he has written. He says, and very truly, that &quot;he has played fair with his readers, given them every bit of information-all the clues to the identity of the person who committed the crime—that he himself has, but managing to lead their attention away from the real culprit until the desired moment for climax and revelation has arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In this kind of story when the big smash comes the reader should be able to go back in the story, and having reread all that goes up to the climax be able to unravel each clue which leads to the climax.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the true spirit of the writer of detective fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;maintaining-suspense&quot;&gt;Maintaining Suspense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another and very necessary point to remember is that the mystery must be of sufficient interest to be worth unraveling. To quote Anna Katharine Green on her methods of construction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I must have a central idea which appeals to my imagination; and an end of such point or interest that the reader will feel that it justifies the intricacies which are introduced to hold it back. In other words the heart of the labyrinth must be worth reaching.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This of course refers especially to books, where more intricacies must be introduced than in a short-story. Mr. Burton E. Stevenson, a successful writer of detective fiction, professes these principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;First, to play fair with the reader, the cards must all lie on the table. It isn't honest to keep any up your sleeve; and the problem is to surprise the reader by the unexpected way in which you combine them. The reader must have before him all the facts which the solver of the mystery has, and then the 'Solver' must get there first. I also refuse to make any person act suspiciously without cause. If the person is innocent there is no reason why he should behave as though he were guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I think perhaps my particular trick is to keep the reader in suspense not so much as to what is going to happen as to how it is going to happen. I may add that it also seems necessary to me that every mystery should be approached from at least two angles; say, an amateur detective and a professional one, for instance; and that a great part of the interest of the story lies in the conflict between them, victory leaning first toward one and then toward the other. When I start a story I write it clear through, working regularly every day, (though it takes the lash sometimes) and then going back to do the dovetailing. There must be no loose ends; every joint must fit and there must be no superfluous lumber. A detective story ought to run a swift, straight course from start to finish. It isn't a leisurely stroll through the country, it's a hundred yard dash! And you may have noted that in &quot;The Boule Cabinet&quot; there isn't a hint of love interest; love interest is dead weight unless it is an essential part of the plot; and one can't carry much dead weight and win a hundred yard dash.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Stevenson succinctly expresses the true principles of detective fiction; and by adhering to these, the young writer is travelling in the right path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nevil Monroe Hopkins—whose detective, &quot;Mason Brant,&quot; operates in &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. North,&quot; and other novelettes—writes thus on the same subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I endeavor to start right off with action and to maintain it throughout, introducing such interesting characters and atmosphere as I can. I try to have a novel plot and to make most of the characters talk to each other in a direct manner; and to have some of the meeting-places, at least, rather gruesome. I endeavor also to have a golden thread of love and romance running from start to finish, upon which to string the more unwholesome elements which are necessary to contribute effectively to the phases of mystery. I believe always in writing deductively, in visiting queer places, and in accumulating acquaintances among police officials, doctors, lawyers, coroners, and the like.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we see that the advisability of romance in detective stories is a matter of opinion, and opinions differ among the authorities. But the love interest, if not overdone, may be left to the discretion of the author, remembering that the mystery is the primary interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;planning-the-story&quot;&gt;Planning the Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henry Kitchell Webster gives perhaps a more definite formula than those above quoted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;BEFORE WRITING: 1. Plan original crime, method, and motive of the murderer. 2. Create, with this as a nucleus, sub-plots relating to several persons who by coincidence are drawn to the place or are connected with the victim, in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;THEN WRITE. 1. Introduction. 2. Murder discovery. 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then take up the least likely suspect first, followed by others. 4. Hero Detective enters, decides, arrests and explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Gelett Burgess constructs his stories by architectural diagrams. The first story in his book, &quot;The Master of Mysteries,&quot; (published anonymously) is &quot;The Missing John Hudson&quot;—We subjoin its preliminary plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Murder)
(A) d)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C) d)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Theft)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;The Missing John Hudson&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a, b, c, d = Clues A, B, C, D = Hypotheses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another well-known writer gives this very definite formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Preliminaries. Status quo. Introduction of dramatis personae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Birth of Plot. Assembly of actors and assignment of parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tentative separation of sheep from goats, intentionally misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Crime,—shot into the story like a bomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Gropings for murderer, on part of the police, coroner, friends, relatives and amateur detective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Failure of everybody. Call in Transcendent Detective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He glances about, announces that the facts are thus and so and proves that the facts are thus and so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Discreet removal of the villain by suicide, accident or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Marriage of the girl to the amateur detective. (This is invariable and imperative!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The last item is in satiric vein, for among our best writers it is not considered imperative!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the foregoing formulae, kindly contributed by their authors, cannot fail to be of use to the beginning writer of Detective Stories. They all agree in the principal points, and are quite in line with Poe's strict laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rights of the reader must be kept in mind by the author. It is not fair to mislead the reader until he is up against a blank wall. A false clue must lead in an obvious and seemingly logical direction. Then the false clue must be detected, as a natural consequence of the mistaken lead, and the right clues brought into view. It is not fair to make an innocent character appear guilty or vice versa, but it is quite right if the character make himself appear so. A witness who stammers and hesitates, may be guilty or may be innocently embarrassed. That is for the reader to judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just in proportion to the cleverness and subtlety of the author's inventive genius, will the reader be duly and rightfully bewildered, or misled, and the game be well played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof. Max Dessoir, in a very fine article on &quot;The Psychology of Conjuring,&quot; writes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;By awakening interest in some unimportant detail, the conjurer concentrates that attention on some false point, or negatively, diverts it from the main object, and we all know the senses of an inattentive person are pretty dull… When causing the disappearance of some object, the conjurer counts one, two, three, because, the attention of the public being diverted to three, they do not notice what happens at one and two… A specially successful method of diversion is founded on the human craze for imitation… The conjurer counts on this in many cases. He always looks in the direction where he wants the attention of the public, and does everything himself which he wants the public to do… If the trick is in the left hand, the conjurer turns sharply to the person to the right, presuming correctly that the spectators will make the same movement, and will not notice what is going on in the left hand… Every sharp, short remark will, for a moment, at least, divert the eyes from the hands and direct them to the mouth, according to the above-mentioned law of imitation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These most valuable directions may be helpfully adapted to the writing of Detective Stories. The author is, in a way, a conjuror, with an avowed intent to hoodwink his audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detective Stories call for logic, plausibility and a true sense of proportion. Literary ability is to be desired; but before that, there must be power of deduction and a perfect sense of values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-question-of-humor&quot;&gt;The Question of Humor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If romance is out of place in a detective story, humor is even more so. With the exception of the whimsical De Quincey and the waggish Zangwill, few can write or read about murder with any touch of humor. The best Detective Stories are absolutely void of it, and except in the hands of a whimsical genius it is entirely out of place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zangwill wrote only one Detective Story, but that one is unique; and in plot far and away cleverer than any tale of a Transcendent Detective. Though professing to care little for this Detective Story of his, he says in the preface to its second edition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'Big Bow Mystery1 seems to me an excellent murder story, as murder stories go, for, while as sensational as the most of them, it contains more humor and character creation than the best. Indeed, the humor is too abundant. Mysteries should be sedate and sober. There should be a pervasive atmosphere of horror and awe such as Poe manages to create. Humor is out of tone; it would be more artistic to preserve a somber note throughout. But I was a realist in those days, and in real life mysteries occur to real persons with their individual humors, and mysterious circumstances are apt to be complicated by comic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;some-unique-devices&quot;&gt;Some Unique Devices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unique plot in which the unsuspected criminal is ever before us is &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; by Gaston Leroux. This astonishing story depends on two absolutely original propositions. One, that the attempt at murder in an inaccessible room occurred long before it was supposed to have done so. The other that the great and celebrated detective who condescends to take the case is really the criminal. But the workmanship of this story and the several and perfect surprises can only be appreciated by reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in all probability the great desire of the detective writer to choose for his criminal the character least likely to be suspected, that first suggested making the criminal of the story the detective also. Surely the last person the reader would suspect would be the detective. This has been frequently done of late, indeed so frequently as to cause great danger of this plot's losing its effectiveness. For the astute reader, always ready to learn the latest trick, has even now begun to suspect the least likely one for the criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Accomplice,&quot; by F.T. Hill, the criminal is the prosecuting attorney, which is in itself a clever idea, and gives scope for beautifully misleading incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a word, then, marshal your characters tentatively and select the one seemingly impossible as a criminal. Give him a plausible and adequate motive. Give him opportunity. Give him intelligence and ability to hide his traces; and then go on, using every sidelight and every tiny clue possible, gently to persuade your reader, but never to force him, to a false conclusion; and then at the last spring your surprise suddenly and drop the curtain at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing is more annoying to the trained reader than a long chapter of explanation after the revelation. We have sometimes more than one chapter of the dead criminal's written confession, and our wonder and curiosity also being dead, we take little interest in the perusal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless this post-mortem confession is inevitable to your plot, so arrange it that the motives and methods are explained just before the climax instead of just after, Conan Doyle beautifully escaped this situation in &quot;A Study in Scarlet/' by reserving Sherlock Holmes' explanation of his own work until after the long and wearisome interpolation revealing the motive of the crime. The reader waded through, or skimmed through those chapters, because spurred on by his desire to learn the re-solution of the problem, to which he knew the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Conan Doyle is not at his best in mystery novels. The short-story is his forte. In &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; the author realizes often that the action must be retarded, and Sherlock Holmes for once in his life is obliged to bungle. About a third of the way through the book. Holmes indulges in a shrug and a rueful smile. &quot;Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,&quot; said he.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never in a short-story would he have made his third thread snap, nor would he, indeed, have had any third thread; the first would have led to the desired goal. But in a book, threads must be multiplied and snapped and tangled to make the larger web. In &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; we are treated to descriptions of scenery. We learn that &quot;Rolling pasture lands curved upwards on either side of us, and old gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful and sunlit country-side there rose, ever dark against the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister hills.&quot; In a short-story these things would have been left to the imagination, for lack of room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration is that, in the book, unnecessary though acceptable characters had to be introduced, such as Selden and his wife's brother. A love interest is introduced around the beautiful Miss Stapleton. The device of Watson's diary report is introduced to delay the decisions of Sherlock Holmes. And the mysterious &quot;L.L.&quot; is invented for the same reason. But so accustomed is Conan Doyle to the quick action of a short-story that these forced delays hamper him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is, however, exceedingly clever in palming off his own desires for delay upon his characters; as for instance in the following detail of Holmes' character:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of Sherlock Holmes's defects—if, indeed, one may call it a defect—was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfillment. Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him. Partly also from his professional caution, which urged him never to take any chances. The result, however, was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants. I had often suffered under it, but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we were about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing, and I could only surmise what his course of action would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, the real reason for Holmes' silence during that long, dark drive was because if he had told all he knew, the story would have ended then and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is characteristic of Conan Doyle, the denouement of this story entirely satisfies the reader. The exceedingly bizarre conception of this supernatural hound is logically and rationally explained. Moreover, and the young writer would do well to note this point, the criminal is summarily and inconspicuously disposed of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always unpleasant to contemplate the hanging or the electrocuting of the fiction criminal. For this reason he not infrequently takes poison (which he has ready in his pocket), as soon as he is discovered, and dies peacefully, close upon the last words of his confession. This is one of the conventions adopted to spare the reader's feelings. For a criminal that can hold the reader's interest throughout the story is often too attractive a character to be permitted a horrible taking off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these conventions and devices and unwritten laws of the technique of the Mystery Story can only be learned—or, at least, can best be learned—from the thoughtful reading of the works of the masters in this field. The beauty and value of these creations cannot be appreciated by the casual or untrained reader. Only a connoisseur in the art of detective fiction can appreciate and intelligently enjoy the skill with which a great author plays with his readers. It may be likened to the skilled fisherman playing with trout. Or perhaps it is better symbolized by these remarks of the Great Herrman when speaking of his handcuff tricks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Common sense alone does not entitle a person to judge competently of the safety of fetters; only the man who is familiar with the technique of knots and the different ways of tying can express an opinion. To decide whether a closure is right or not, requires technical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most people imagine that they can go unprepared to a spiritualistic seance, and pass a correct opinion on the existence or nonexistence of prestidigitation. This standpoint is as childish as when a layman expresses himself on the genuineness of the seal of the middle ages or on the nature of a nervous affection.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, the reader who is unversed in the arts and crafts of detective fiction cannot be expected to value the skill shown in the great presentations of The Problem and its Solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appearance of the detective is always of interest and each author in turn endeavors to make his marvelous-minded creature look as physically unlike other fiction detectives as possible. And especially does he aim to have him totally different in his effects from the popular conception of the conventional detective. In fact the average detective of fiction is always declared to look absolutely unlike the average detective of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;some-early-detective-portraits&quot;&gt;Some Early Detective Portraits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M. Dupin is not described physically, as Poe's marvelous economy of attention made him omit every possible bit of material extraneous to his actual story. But, beginning let us say, with Lecoq, all seem to be diametrically opposed to the conventional detective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote from &quot;The Crime of Orcival&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;M. Lecoq, whom none of them had ever met before, in no wise resembled the conventional French detective. The latter is commonly depicted as a tall fellow, with heavy moustaches and &quot;imperial,&quot; wearing a military stock collar, a greasy silk hat, and a threadbare frock-coat buttoned up to the throat so as to conceal either the complete absence of linen or at all events the extreme dirtiness of a calico shirt. Such an individual will have immense feet incaged in heavy Wellingtons and will carry in his right hand a powerful sword-stick or bludgeon. Now M. Lecoq, as he appeared in the diningroom at Valfeuillu, had nothing whatever in common with this familiar type. It is true, however, that he can assume whatever air he pleases. Although his friends declare that he has features of his own which he retains at home when sitting by his own fire-side, with his slippers on, this is by no means certain. At all events, his mobile face lends itself to strange transformations, and he modifies his features according to his will just as the sculptor moulds his modelling clay. He changes everything, even the expression of his eyes. On this occasion M. Lecoq had assumed a handsome wig of lank hair, neither fair nor dark, but rather pretentiously parted on one side. Whiskers of the same vague colour puffed out with bad pomade, encircled his pallid face. His eyelids were very red; his eyes seemed weak and watery, and an open smile rested on his thick lips, which, in parting, disclosed a range of long yellow teeth. Timidity, self-sufficiency, and contentment were equally blended in the expression of his features. No one would ever have credited the possessor of such a head with even average intelligence. He looked the picture of some dull-minded, money-grubbing haberdasher, who after cheating his customers for thirty years, had retired on a large income. His coat was like all other coats, his trousers like all other trousers. A hair-chain, of the same colour as his whiskers, spanned his stomach, and a large silver watch could be seen bulging out of his left waistcoat pocket. While he spoke he fumbled with a horn box full of tiny square lozenges, and adorned on the cover with the portrait of a homely well- dressed woman, &quot;the dear defunct,11 no doubt. As the conversation proceeded, according as he was satisfied or disturbed, M. Lecoq munched one of these lozenges or gave the portrait a glance which was quite a poem in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, this was Lecoq in disguise. But the natural man, though seldom seen, was also unlike the regulation French detective. At his very first appearance on Gaboriau's pages he is described thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… he was about twenty-five years old, with a pale face, red lips and an abundance of curly black hair, but with scarcely a sign of beard or mustache. He was short but well-made, and his whole manner denoted energy of extraordinary character. With the exception of his eyes, there was nothing very remarkable in his appearance, but these either shone brilliantly or else grew dull, according to the disposition of the moment. His nose, which was rather wide, possessed an amount of flexibility that was extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor is old Father Tabaret, except on close inspection, apparently possessed of detective insight. Here is his picture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a large, heavily curtained bed, covered up almost to the nose, lay the oracle of the Rue de Jerusalem. It was almost impossible to believe that such great intelligence could exist in that figure, the face of which showed nothing but the appearance of the greatest stupidity; a retreating forehead, huge ears, a little snub nose, small eyes, and thick lips, made M. Tabaret look more like a half-witted citizen than the sagacious citizen that he was. It is true that when he was closely examined there was something in him resembling a sleuth-hound, the habits and instincts of which he possessed to such a great extent. In the street the impudent young urchins would shout after him, &quot;Oh! what a guy,&quot; but he laughed at all this, and even took a pleasure in putting on an extra appearance of folly and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vidocq, though not declared to be uncommon in his appearance, is sufficiently so to give him the necessary prestige. We are told that &quot;he was a strong, well-built man with square shoulders and shambling gait. He had gray hair, a thick nose, blue eyes, a smooth face and a perpetual smile.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Vidocq really lived, yet his &quot;Memoirs&quot; are believed to be largely fiction, and so we may class him, in part at least, among our story-book friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilkie Collins deliberately draws his picture of the official detective thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For a family in our situation, the Superintendent of the Frizinghall police was the most comforting officer you could wish to see. Mr. Seegrave was tall and portly, and military in his manners. He had a fine, commanding voice, and a mighty resolute eye, and a grand frock coat which buttoned beautifully up to his leather stock. &quot;I'm the man you want,11 was written all over his face; and he ordered his two inferior policemen about with a severity which convinced us all that there was no trifling with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, in every respect a vivid contrast, he gives us a picture of the engaging Sergeant Cuff, for after all, the beauty of a detective is largely in the eye of the beholder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the time came for the Sergeant's arrival I went down to the gate to look out for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A fly from the railway drove up as I reached the lodge; and out got a grizzled, elderly man, so miserably lean that he looked as if he had not got an ounce of flesh on his bones in any part of him. He was dressed all in decent black, with a white cravat round his neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His face was as sharp as a hatchet, and the skin of it was as yellow and dry and withered as an autumn leaf. His eyes, of a steely light gray, had a disconcerting trick, when they encountered your eyes, of looking as if they expected something more from you than you were aware of yourself. His walk was soft; his voice was melancholy; his long, lanky fingers were hooked like claws. He might have been a parson, or an undertaker, or anything else you like, except what he really was. A more complete opposite to Superintendent Seegrave than Sergeant Cuff, and a less comforting officer to look at for a family in distress, I defy you to discover, search where you may.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;some-more-modern-portraits&quot;&gt;Some More Modern Portraits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes is too well known to the reading public to require description here, but a brief account of his appearance, as detailed by Watson, proves his unlikeness to those we have previously looked at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so exceedingly lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In almost ludicrous contrast to Holmes is a young detective who never achieved Sherlock's popularity, but whose wonderful instinct for pure reasoning puts him at the head of his own class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Rouletabille, who figures in &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; by Gaston Leroux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His friend Sainclair, who is his Watsonian chronicler, says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I first knew Joseph Rouletabille when he was a young reporter. At that time I was a beginner at the Bar and often met him in the corridors of examining magistrates, when I had gone to get a &quot;permit to communicate&quot; for the prison of Mazas, or for Saint-Lazare. He had, as they say, &quot;a good nut.&quot; He seemed to have taken his head—round as a bullet—out of a box of marbles, and it is from that, I think, that his comrades of the press—all determined billiard-players—had given him that nickname, which was to stick to him and be made illustrious by him. He was always as red as a tomato, now gay as a lark, now grave as a judge. How, while still so young—he was only sixteen and a half years old when I saw him for the first time—had he already won his way on the press? That was what everybody who came into contact with him might have asked, if they had not known his history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically, however, Rouletabille was not nominally the great detective of the book—that honor was given to Frederick Larsan—who seemed to show a few of Sherlock Holmes' physical characteristics. This is Larsan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He might be about fifty years of age. He had a fine head, his hair turning grey; a colourless complexion, and a firm profile. His forehead was prominent, his chin and cheeks clean shaven. His upper lip, without moustache, was finely chiselled. His eyes were rather small and round, with a look in them that was at once searching and disquieting. He was of middle height and well built, with a general bearing elegant and gentlemanly. There was nothing about him of the vulgar policeman. In his way, he was an artist, and one felt that he had a high opinion of himself. The sceptical tone of his conversation was that of a man who had been taught by experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His strange profession had brought him into contact with so many crimes and villainies that it would have been remarkable if his nature had not been a little hardened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An interesting-looking detective is &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot; of Jacques Futrelle. His description is written with Mr. Futrelle's individual touch, and Professor Van Dusen possesses the squint which Mr. Train regards as a detective's birthright:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Practically all those letters remaining in the alphabet after Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen was named, were afterward acquired by that gentleman in the course of a brilliant scientific career, and, being honorably acquired, were tacked on to the other end. His name, therefore, taken with all that belonged to it, was a wonderfully imposing structure. He was a Ph.D., an LL.D., an F.R.S. an M.D., and an M.D.S. He was also some other things—just what, he himself couldn't say—through recognition of his ability by various foreign educational and scientific institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In appearance he was no less striking than in nomenclature. He was slender, with the droop of the student in his thin shoulders and the pallor of a close, sedentary life on his clean-shaven face. His eyes wore a perpetual, forbidding squint—the squint of a man who studies little things—and when they could be seen at all through his thick spectacles, were mere slits of watery blue. But above his eyes was his most striking feature. This was a tall, broad brow, almost abnormal in height and width, crowned by a heavy shock of bushy, yellow hair. All these things conspired to give him a peculiar, almost grotesque personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Katharine Green is one of the very best constructors of a detective story. The first introduction of her Mr. Gryce begins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And here let me say that Mr. Gryce, the detective, was not the thin, wiry individual with the piercing eye you are doubtless expecting to see. On the contrary, Mr. Gryce was a portly, comfortable personage with an eye that never pierced, that did not even rest on you. If it rested anywhere, it was always on some insignificant object in the vicinity, some vase, inkstand, book, or button. These things he would seem to take into his confidence, make the repositories of his conclusions; but as for you—you might as well be the steeple on Trinity Church, for all connection you ever appeared to have with him or his thoughts. At present, then, Mr. Gryce was, as I have already suggested, on intimate terms with the doorknob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in a later book she again insists upon this unlikeness to what may be expected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was therefore moving reluctantly away, when I felt a slight but peremptory touch on the arm, and turning, saw the detective a my side, still studying his piece of china.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He was, as I have said, of portly build and benevolent aspect; a fatherly-looking man, and not at all the person one would be likely to associate with the police. Yet he could take the lead very naturally, and when he spoke, I felt bound to answer him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grodman, in &quot;Big Bow Mystery,&quot; is briefly described by Mr. Zangwill:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After an age seven minutes by any honest clock—Grodman made his appearance, looking as dressed as usual, but with unkempt hair and with disconsolate side- whisker yet, for it had only recently come within the margin of cultivation. In active service Grodman had been clean-shaven, like all members of the profession—for surely your detective is the most versatile of actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is the picture of Wimp the official detective in the same book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wimp was young and fresh-colored. He had a Roman nose, and was smartly dressed. He had beaten Grodman by discovering the wife Heaven meant for him. He had a bouncing boy, who stole jam out of the pantry without any one being the wiser. Wimp did what work he could do at home in a secluded study at the top of the house. Outside his chamber of horrors he was the ordinary husband of commerce. He adored his wife, who thought poorly of his intellect, but highly of his heart. In domestic difficulties Wimp was helpless. He could not even tell whether the servant's &quot;character&quot; was forged or genuine. Probably he could not level himself to such petty problems. He was like the senior wrangler who has forgotten how to do quadratics, and has to solve equations of the second degree by the calculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reference to Wimp's wife is thus explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a moment the first floor window was raised—the little house was of the same pattern as her own—and Grodman's full, fleshy face loomed through the fog in sleepy irritation from under a nightcap. Despite its scowl the detective's face dawned upon her like the sun upon an occupant of the haunted chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What in the devil's the matter?&quot; he growled. Grodman was not an early bird, now that he had no worms to catch. He could afford to despise proverbs now, for the house in which he lived was his, and he lived in it because several other houses in the street were also his and it is well for the landlord to be about his own estate in Bow where poachers often shoot the moon. Perhaps the desire to enjoy his greatness among his early cronies counted for something, too, for he had been born and bred at Bow, receiving when a youth his first engagement from the local police quarters, whence he drew a few shillings a week as an amateur detective in his leisure hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Grodman was still a bachelor. In the celestial matrimonial bureau a partner might have been selected for him, but he had never been able to discover her. It was his one failure as a detective. He was a self-sufficing person, who preferred a gas stove to a domestic; but in deference to Glover Street opinion he admitted a female factotum between ten a.m. and ten p.m., and, equally in deference to Glover Street opinion, excluded her between ten p.m. and ten a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;some-less-known-portraits&quot;&gt;Some Less Known Portraits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gordon Holmes inclines to Wilkie Collins' plan of contrasting the appearance of the real detective and the fictional at once. In &quot;A Mysterious Disappearance&quot; he presents these opposite physical effects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Inspector White, of Scotland Yard, was announced, and a short, thick-set man entered. He was absolutely round in every part. His sturdy, rotund frame was supported on stout, well-moulded legs. His bullet head, with close- cropped hair, gave a suggestion of strength to his rounded face, and a pair of small bright eyes looked suspiciously on the world from beneath well-arched eyebrows. Two personalities more dissimilar than those of Claude Bruce and Inspector White could hardly be brought together in the same room. People who are fond of tracing resemblances to animals in human beings would liken the one to a gray-hound, the other to a bull-dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yet they were both masters in the art of detecting crime—the barrister subtle, analytic, introspective; the policeman direct, pertinacious, self-confident. Bruce lost all interest in a case when the hidden trail was laid bare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mr. White regarded investigation as so many hours on duty until his man was transported or hanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Whispering Man,&quot; an astonishing detective story by Henry Kitchell Webster, we have this description of the detective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He was the sort of a man who never would be spoken of as old, if it were not for his attempts to look young. He was actually, I should judge, somewhere in the middle forties, a tall, graceful, and commanding figure, with a strikingly handsome face. There was nothing weak about it. The features were big and boldly, though finely, modeled, and the deep-set eyes singularly expressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The only fault one could find with him was that he carried everything just a little too far. He was too aggressively well dressed; too painfully clean-shaven; his manner a little too dignified; his voice and features a little too expressive. It came upon me all at once what he must be—an actor. That was it. Everything about him was heightened just enough to carry itself over the footlights. He was in evening dress, wore an overcoat and gloves, and carried a walking stick, as well as an irreproachable silk hat, in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Scales of Justice,&quot; an exceptionally clever surprise story by George L. Knapp, the Hero Detective is not a professional one, but a young newspaper reporter. He is therefore allowed the characteristics of our best newspaper men, but in all probability he inherits his sardonic humor from his predecessor Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kern tossed the shears into a drawer, and stood up. He was as tall as the other man, and as straight; and both had that alert look of expectancy, quite unmixed with either wonder or nervousness, which marks our best newspaper men. There the resemblance ended. Jennings was about thirty-five, smooth-shaven, smiling brown of hair and blue of eye; with humorous little wrinkles around the eyes to testify of the many funny things he had seen. Kern was twenty-eight or twenty-nine; and his coal-black hair and bronze-black Vandyke beard made him look more like an Austrian surgeon than an American reporter. His humor was apt to be sardonic; and a certain element of moodiness was seldom absent from his face. &quot;Kern is really a secret sufferer from the artistic temperament,&quot; said the managing editor once, &quot;but so long as he's trying to live it down, I won't give him away.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Average Jones,&quot; the creation of Samuel Hopkins Adams, achieves a distinction by being inconspicuous:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He was, so to speak, a composite photograph of any thousand well-conditioned, clean living Americans between the ages of twenty-five and thirty. Happily, his otherwise commonplace face was relieved by the one unfailing characteristic of composite photographs, large, deep-set and thoughtful eyes. Otherwise he would have passed in any crowd, and nobody would have noticed him pass. Now, at twenty-seven, he looked back over the five years since his graduation from college and wondered what he had done with them; and at the four previous years of undergraduate life and wondered how he had done so well with those, and why he had not in some manner justified the parting words of his favorite professor: &quot;You have one rare faculty, Jones. You can, when you choose, sharpen the pencil of your mind to a very fine point. Specialize, my boy, specialize.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little like &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot; is &quot;The Man in the Comer,&quot; described thus by the Baroness Orczy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The appearance of the man was sufficient to tickle the most ultramorose fancy. Polly thought to herself that she had never seen anyone so pale, so thin, with such funny light-coloured hair, brushed very smoothly across the top of a very dubiously bald crown. He looked so timid and nervous as he fidgeted incessantly with a piece of string; his long, lean, and trembling fingers tying and untying it into knots of wonderful and complicated proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astro, the hero of Gelett Burgess's book of Mystery Stories, is perhaps the farthest possible remove from a conventional detective in appearance. Though not described categorically, we are given various word pictures of him in his &quot;psychic studio.&quot; There he lounges among oriental divans and draperies, wearing a jewelled turban, flowing silken robes, and other characteristic apparel, as he indulges in the enjoyment of his silver-mounted water-pipe or his pet white lizard. He has sufficiently unusual eccentricities to put him in the list of correctly made up fiction detectives, and though blase, he is original and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;idiosyncrasies-of-fictional-detectives&quot;&gt;Idiosyncrasies of Fictional Detectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most fictional detectives have peculiar and individual tricks of personality which are doubtless intended for the reader to remember them by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dupin had the most pronouncedly queer traits of all. Perhaps none of his successors ever achieved anything so freakish as this described below; and which, had he lived to-day, would have given him a claim to the title of &quot;Sun Dodger.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?) to be enamoured of the night for her own sake, and into this bizarrerie, as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon. The sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always; but we could counterfeit her presence. At the first dawn of the morning we closed all the messy shutters of our old building; lighted a couple of tapers, which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays. By the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreams—reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by the clock of the advent of the true darkness. Then we sallied forth into the streets, arm and arm, continuing the topics of the day, or roaming far and wide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city, that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes' idiosyncrasies are too well known to need recapitulation. His morphine habit, his musical taste and his sardonic moods are familiar to all. Holmes also had a habit of listening to his clients' recitals with his eyes shut. Though to be sure this was less radical than the proceeding of Dupin who &quot;sat in his accustomed armchair, the embodiment of respectful attention&quot; but he wore green spectacles which allowed him to &quot;sleep not the less soundly, though silently&quot; throughout the long account of the case by the Prefect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holmes' odd habits are here referred to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend Sherlock Holmes was that, although in his methods of thought he was the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also he affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the less in his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction. Not that I am in the least conventional in that respect myself. The rough-and- tumble work in Afghanistan, coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of disposition, has made me rather more lax than befits a medical man. But with me there is a limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself virtuous airs. I have always held, too, that pistol practice should be distinctly an open-air pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his queer humors would sit in an arm-chair with his hair- trigger and a hundred Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic V.R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are, we must admit, unusual habits, but still Dr. Watson assures us that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the city. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, Dr. Watson's suspicions were confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecoq's eccentricity was his habit of silent communion with a portrait of his wife which he carried with him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;M. Lecoq had recourse to the portrait on the lozenge- box. His look was more than a glance, it was a confidence. He was evidently saying something to the dear defunct, which he dared not utter aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This habit is also noted in Mr. Gryce. This delightful old gentleman had a way of addressing himself to any small inanimate object in his neighborhood. It might be an inkstand or a doorknob, but he treated it, to all appearance, as his guide, philosopher and friend. On one occasion he became very chummy with a statue at the foot of a staircase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whereupon I repeated my words, this time very quietly but clearly, while Mr. Gryce continued to frown at the bronze figure he had taken into his confidence. When I had finished, Mr. Van Burnam's countenance had changed, so had his manner. He held himself as erect as before, but not with as much bravado. He showed haste and impatience also, but not the same kind of haste and not quite the same kind of impatience. The corners of Mr. Gryce's mouth betrayed that he noted this change, but he did not turn away from the newel-post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, upon occasion, Mr. Gryce is unable to take active interest in the evidence being deposed by a witness because of his intense absorption in a &quot;close and confidential confab with his own finger-tips.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergeant Cuff, however, has a very sane and pleasant fad of his own, but he puts it to its proper use when he employs it to evade impertinent or unwelcome queries. Instead of dashing madly into his &quot;investigations&quot; the celebrated detective goes off on a side track thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah, you've got the right exposure here to the south and sou'west,&quot; says the Sergeant, with a wag of his grizzled head, and a streak of pleasure in his melancholy voice. &quot;This is the shape for a rosery—nothing like a circle set in a square. Yes, yes; with walks between all the beds. But they oughtn't to be gravel-walks like these. Grass, Mr. Gardener—grass-walks between your roses; gravel's too hard for them. That's a sweet pretty bed of white roses and blush roses. They always mix well together, don't they? Here's the white musk-rose, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Betteredge—our old English rose holding up his head along with the best and newest of them. Pretty dear!&quot; says the Sergeant, fondling the musk-rose with his lanky fingers, and speaking to it as if he were speaking to a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This was a nice sort of a man to recover Miss Rachel's Diamond, and to find out the thief who stole it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You seem to be fond of roses. Sergeant?&quot; I remarked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I haven't much time to be fond of anything,&quot; says Sergeant Cuff. &quot;But, when I have a moment's fondness to bestow, most times, Mr. Betteredge, the roses get it. I began my life among them in my father's nursery garden, and I shall end my life among them if I can. Yes. One of these days (please God) I shall retire from catching thieves, and try my hand at growing roses. There will be grass-walks, Mr. Gardener, between my beds,&quot; says the Sergeant, on whose mind the gravel-paths of a rosery seemed to dwell unpleasantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;It seems an odd taste, sir,&quot; I ventured to say, &quot;for a man in your line of life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;If you will look about you (which most people won't do),&quot; says Sergeant Cuff, &quot;you will see that the nature of a man's tastes is, most times, as opposite as possible to the nature of a man's business. Show me any two things more opposite one from the other than a rose and a thief, and I'll correct my tastes accordingly—if it isn't too late at my time of life. You find the damask-rose a good- ish stock for most of the tender sorts, don't you, Mr. Gardener? Ah! I thought so. Here's a lady coming. Is it Lady Verinder?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peculiarity of &quot;The Whispering Man,&quot; and what gives him his title, is a curious vocal defect which at times prevents his audible speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;favorite-phrases-of-detectives&quot;&gt;Favorite Phrases of Detectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Thinking Machine,&quot; aside from his petulance and impatience, continually repeats two or three favorite phrases that annoy the reader quite as much as the clients annoy this astute detective. One of them is, &quot;Don't say it is impossible! that annoys me exceedingly! Nothing is impossible to the human mind!&quot; This assertion, innocent enough in itself, is so frequently repeated as to become intolerable. Another phrase of which Professor Van Dusen is inordinately fond, is, &quot;Two and two make four, not sometimes, but all the time.&quot; This also is repeated so often as to become tiresome. To quote the Professor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Two and two make four, not sometimes, but all the time,&quot; he began, at last as if disputing some previous assertion. &quot;As the figure two, wholly disconnected from any other, gives small indication of a result, so is an isolated fact of little consequence. Yet that fact added to another, and the resulting fact added to a third, and so on, will give a final result. That result, if every fact is considered must be correct. Thus any problem may be solved by logic; logic is inevitable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, variations on a theme of two and two making four are hackneyed in detective fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a figure of speech, the proposition that two and two make four except in unusual cases, is fair enough. It is paraphrased thus: in &quot;A Mysterious Disappearance:&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I can't s'y as I know anythink about it, sir, but by puttin' two and two together it makes four sometimes—not always.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Quite right. You're a philosopher. Let me hear the two two's. We'll see about the addition afterwards.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is humorously referred to in &quot;The Circular Staircase,&quot; by Mary Roberts Rinehart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At this point in my story, Halsey always says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Trust a woman to add two and two together, and make six&quot; To which I retort that if two and two plus X make six, then to discover the unknown quantity is the simplest thing in the world. That a houseful of detectives missed it entirely was because they were busy trying to prove that two and two make four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same proposition is quoted as the keynote of a detective's method in &quot;The Holladay Case&quot; where, in praise of the detective, it is remarked, &quot;Your work convinced us that you know how to put two and two together, which is more than can be said for the ordinary mortal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in &quot;The House Opposite&quot; the detective declares that to succeed in his profession requires, &quot;accurate and most minute powers of observation, unlimited patience, and a capacity for putting two and two together.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sherlock Holmes shows a grasp of the principle, when he says, &quot;If you were asked to prove that two and two make four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe disdained the simple reference to two plus two, but embodied a similar idea in this subtle manner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that X squared plus px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where X squared plus px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aspiring author, then, will do well to omit further references to the adding of two and two as an illuminating point in his story. Eccentricities or freakish habits on the part of his detective are permissible if not harped upon too continuously. But let them be of a pleasant or at least of an unobjectionable nature, and not like a habit attributed to a detective in a series of stories now current, who pulled at the lobe of his ear, until a fastidious reader was fain to close the book in disgust. Let the habits of your hero be whimsical, mysterious, or erratic, if you choose; but let them be agreeable and not too frequently reiterated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;length&quot;&gt;Length&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the construction of our story we must consider the question of length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, and in the opinion of many authorities best there is the short-story. With exceptions, the best mystery stories are short-stories. A short-story lends itself peculiarly to a mystery plot, principally because it is not easy to keep wonder and curiosity alive through a long story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, many detective stories fall naturally into the length of a novelette—say 30,000 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is a two-or three-part story, which differs from the novelette in construction, even when of the same length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another form is the serial, in which each installment must have its own climax, all leading to the final surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last of all, there is the full-sized book, where the interest may or may not be broken before the denouement and solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-short-story-and-the-novel&quot;&gt;The Short-Story and the Novel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of making many books concerning and dissecting the short- story there is no end. As many probably there are regarding the construction of the novel; and between these two forms they tell us there is a great gulf fixed. But the fixing of this gulf is largely a matter of opinion, and the opinions are somewhat diversified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One writer explains the intrinsic difference between a short- story and a story that is merely short. He holds that a short- story is by no means a condensed novel, but is different in kind from a novel. The novelette, however, he contends is a brief novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another writer, following this distinction, goes so far as to say that were the novelette condensed to one half or less of its usually accepted length it would still be a novel and not a short-story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, were a short-story expanded indefinitely it could never become a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foundation of this distinction lies in the principle that a short-story is founded on a unity of impression. It relates, more or less definitely, a single episode; while a novel is a series of correlated episodes, bearing on a single motive. The number of words in a piece of fiction has absolutely no part in determining its nomenclature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe's distinction that a novel cannot be read at a sitting and a short-story can, is not entirely valid. For &quot;a sitting&quot; is surely a most uncertain division of time. To the busy man a sitting may be a half an hour; to the idle woman it may be half a day; while to the &quot;shut-in&quot; it is continuous and interminable. Moreover, in the case of a thrilling Mystery Story, a reader's sitting would be prolonged, even in spite of imperative duty calls, because of the desire to reach the solution of the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, as a distinction, we are told that the novel is expansive and the short-story intensive. Perhaps an illustration might be made by likening the novel to a map of the United States, and the short-story to a single state on the map viewed under a magnifying glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these differentiations regarding short-stories and novels are fully explained and discussed in books exclusively devoted to such technique. And though the fine distinctions therein drawn are of highest importance to other branches of fiction, they are almost, if not entirely, negligible in the case of Detective Stories. For the inherent difference between a novel and a short-story is one of plot. Whereas, since Detective Stories have but one solitary plot,—&quot;the problem and its solution,11—the difference in the detective short-story or the detective novel is merely that of length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;singleness-of-plot-in-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;Singleness of Plot in the Detective Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single plot that makes a Detective Story may be likened to an accordion; it may be pulled out to an extraordinary length, or compressed to a minimum. A detective novel may have minor complications, more characterization and more elaborate setting; but the plot must not vary from the plot of a detective short-story, being only the propounding of the riddle and the revealing of its answer. The longer the story the more numerous and bewildering the conditions of the riddle and the windings of the maze, but all tend definitely to the one end,—the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a short-story the plot rushes on breathlessly, bare and straight to its end. In a novelette there is more room for side- lights, more time for slower development, and more scope for minor issues; while a full-sized book still further amplifies these possibilities. But in these three forms the main thread must go on, without halt, in an ever rising crescendo of interest to the climax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the work is to be published in two or three parts, or if it is a longer serial, then the plan is so far changed as to present a definite climax at the end of each installment. But these must be all minor climaxes and all bearing successively and cumulatively on the final revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-question-of-length&quot;&gt;The Question of Length&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in writing detective fiction, unlike other kinds, the length of his story is entirely at the option of the author. For the detective plot possesses the characteristics of a piece of string; it differs from its fellows only in length. The story of &quot;The Moonstone&quot; could have been told in a hundred pages, but Wilkie Collins gives it five hundred. &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; could have been a full-sized book as well as &quot;The Leavenworth Case.&quot; The inquest scene in the latter fills seventy pages, while Poe's story details the inquest in six pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conan Doyle's stories are short because he uses the single incident of the crime and the single impression of its solution, with an absence of any detail not absolutely necessary. Sherlock Holmes himself, who is often a medium for his author's views, says that he could do in twenty-four hours detective work on which Lecoq occupied six months. This is true enough, but the reason is that, as we have previously pointed out, Lecoq figured in a novel while Sherlock had to do his work expeditiously in the confines of a short-story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaboriau chose to write novels, and so in connection with the problem and its solution he makes use of side issues of all sorts; even including the past history of his characters, subordinate plots, and various byways of conjecture or misleadings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we see the length of a Mystery Story is entirely at the pleasure of the performer, without the hampering rules laid down for the writers of ether types of fiction. Say the plot depends upon a cypher interest. Conan Doyle did the story of the &quot;Dancing Men&quot; in a short-story; Poe's &quot;Gold Bug&quot; is a novelette; while James DeMille's &quot;The Cryptogram&quot; is a very long book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be because Detective Stories are the work of artisans rather than artists that they can be fitted to such a Procrustean bed of literature. But though a sponge may be the size of your head or compressed to the size of your fist, it is the same sponge and comprises and includes the same material and value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this general principle must be taken with limitations. Some of Conan Doyle's short-stories could not be made into satisfactory books, while others could easily be. As in other fiction, a slight incident is not enough for a novel, but a great incident is. A missing Christmas goose might not be of sufficient interest to fill a book, when a murder mystery is. Perhaps w e may say a simple mystery indicates a short-story length, while a complex riddle, or one made complex by side issues means a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet it is here that art steps in. A master hand can make a great interest out of a simple mystery, where a tyro could not succeed. Generally speaking, the short-story must differ from the novel in scope and structure. In detective fiction it differs in scope only; for the main structure is always the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writers of the technique of fiction tell us that another difference between the short-story and the novel lies in the fact that the novel must be a love story, while the short-story need not deal with romance at all. Applied to detective fiction, this may be adapted to mean that a love interest is possible, though not imperative in a novel or a novelette; but a short-story has no reason for romance and no room for it, unless it is a necessary premise to the conditions of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of absolute measurement, perhaps we may call four thousand words an ideal length for a short-story. A novelette should be thirty or thirty-five thousand words long; while a book may run as near as you wish to one hundred thousand words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of Poe's &quot;Gold Bug,&quot; nearly fifteen thousand words, would not be an acceptable size to editors of the present day. And though great writers may be a law unto themselves in this matter, it is wise to arrange a story in accordance with the editors' preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Houdini, the magician, in speaking of his own principles of legerdemain, said: &quot;It is more difficult to support admiration than to excite it,&quot; and so it is more difficult to hold an intellectual curiosity than to arouse it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his introduction to an excellent collection of mystery stories, Mr. Julian Hawthorne has written so discerningly on this subject that we quote from his article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I need hardly point out that there is a distinction and a difference between short riddle stories and long ones—novels. The former require far more technical art for their proper development; the enigma cannot be posed in so many ways, but must be stated once for all; there cannot be false scents, or but a few of them; there can be small opportunity for character drawing, and all kinds of ornament and comment must be reduced to their very lowest terms. Here, indeed, as everywhere, genius will have its way; and while a merely talented writer would deem it impossible to tell the story of 'The Gold Bug1 in less than a volume, Poe could do it in a few thousand words, and yet appear to have said everything worth saying. In the case of the Sherlock Holmes tales, they form a series, and our previous knowledge of the hero enables the writer to dispense with much description and accompaniment that would be necessary had that eminent personage been presented in only a single complication of events. Each special episode of the great analyst's career can therefore be handled with the utmost economy, and yet fill all the requirements of intelligent interest and comprehension. But, as a rule, the riddle novel approaches its theme in a spirit essentially other than that which inspires the short tale. We are given, as it were, a wide landscape instead of a detailed genre picture. The number of the dramatis personae is much larger, and the parts given to many of them may be very small, though each should have his or her necessary function in the general plan. It is much easier to create perplexity on these terms; but on the other hand, the riddle novel demands a power of vivid character portrayal and of telling description which are not indispensable in the briefer narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The fault of all riddle novels is that they inevitably involve two kinds of interest, and can seldom balance these so perfectly that one or the other of them shall not suffer. The mind of the reader becomes weary in its frequent journeys between human characters on one side and the mysterious events on the other, and would prefer the more single-eyed treatment of the short tale. Wonder too is a very tender and short-lived emotion, and sometimes perishes after a few pages. Curiosity is tougher; but that, too, may be baffled too long, and end by tiring of the pursuit while it is yet in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many excellent plots, admirable from the constructive point of view, have been wasted by stringing them out too far; the reader recognizes their merit, but loses his enthusiasm on account of a sort of monotony of strain; he wickedly turns to the concluding chapter, and the game is up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'The Woman in White,' by Wilkie Collins, was published about 1860, I think, in weekly installments, and certainly they were devoured with insatiable appetite by many thousands of readers. But I doubt whether a book of similar merit could command such a following to-day; and I will even confess that I have myself never read the concluding parts, and do not know to this day who the woman was or what were the wrongs from which she so poignantly suffered.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories which ought to be shorter are sometimes made into novels by long and often tedious interpolations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A Study in Scarlet,&quot; one of Conan Doyle's best stories, is unduly spun out by an interpolation which lasts from page 110 to 184. Likewise Gaboriau's &quot;The Mystery of Orcival&quot; has an interpolation from page 104 to 188. These extraneous narratives usually go back and tell of an episode that happened years before the scene of the story, and they are both uninteresting and inartistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule, an author of detective fiction writes either short- stories or novels, but rarely both. Conan Doyle's only mystery novel is &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles;&quot; while Gaboriau and Anna Katharine Green invariably write novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we conclude that length is a matter of taste, and the detective fiction writer may use his own judgment as to the length of his works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-narrator-in-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;The Narrator in the Detective Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Teller of the Detective Story is an important factor in its technique. Many a good plot is spoiled because it is narrated by the wrong person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe, with his quick sense of fitness, chose the narrator best calculated for the exploitation of his clever Dupin. This was a stroke of real genius, for the reader becomes acquainted with the principal through the subordinate. He is taught to look upon the work of a detective intelligently; taught to appreciate and understand it. He knows when it is time to applaud, because the narrator tells him. It is a pity that this narrator is nameless, for as Mrs. Harris, with even less personality, is a household word, so his name would have been. It is this narrator who rouses our interest, tantalizes our impatience, and piques our curiosity, in harmony with his own halting almost unbelieving observance of the marvels revealed to him. He teaches us to be amazed at the proper time and then at the proper time he explains what so amazed us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Watson, narrator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, is a parallel character, though in no sense an imitation or plagiarism. The conditions of the revelations to be made require just such a person to make them; and without a doubt, Sherlock Holmes would have had his Dr. Watson even if Dupin had never had his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the glory and honor cast upon the hero by this humble but adoring satellite, this means of narration has another decided advantage. Since the detective confides in his friend or not, as he chooses, the author can reveal or conceal facts as he chooses, and so mislead the reader at will. What the subordinate does not know he can not tell, and thus is the secret preserved. Again, the subordinate being but fallible, may surmise mistakenly. So then does the reader, and again the author's ends are served.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the author prefers that the tale be told in the third person, but even so, the character of &quot;Harris&quot; is still usually in evidence. Often he is a reporter, for this gives him opportunity to go uninvited, yet free from the stigma of idle curiosity into the scenes of interest. A reporter eager for a &quot;scoop&quot; for his paper, sets a fine example of alert interest and close scrutiny for the reader to profit by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the foreword to &quot;The Silent Bullet&quot; the hero detective picks out his reporter and tells him how useful he will be to him in his work. &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot; has the reporter &quot;Hutchinson Hatch,&quot; while &quot;Rouletabille&quot; has a clever reporter named &quot;Sainclair.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the story may be told directly from the mouth of the author. But the proportion of this manner of telling is not so large in Detective Story work as in other fiction; because there are secrets to be preserved. Not only the main secret of the mystery, but also the secrets of what the strange proceedings of the detective may mean. And if the author is telling the tale, it is manifestly difficult for him to preserve an ingenuous and veracious manner, though this may be done if the author maintains a certain aloofness and an arbitrary standard of what to tell and what not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaboriau's stories are all told in the third person; so are DuBoisgobey's and many of Anna Katharine Green's. Gaston Leroux uses this form and so does Mr. Webster in &quot;The Whispering Man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Moonstone&quot; is a conglomeration of forms. The narrator is changed to suit the needs of the author, and the book is made up of the stories of the diaries of several people interested; &quot;The Woman in White&quot; follows the same narrative method. &quot;The Leavenworth Case&quot; is also told by various people, and sometimes in diary form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not always effective in other fiction, the diary is a most useful form for Detective Stories. For secrets can be confided to a diary, and though thus revealed to the reader, they are not disclosed to the other characters in the book; which is frequently a necessary condition. While never used for the whole book, the diary form often appears on certain pages of the story. &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles,&quot; and many of our best authors' works show more or less of the useful and often necessary diary form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever narrator is chosen, let the choice be made after careful consideration of the conditions of the story. If there is a great surprise which must be concealed until the end, the narrator must be kept in ignorance of it until the end. If the story hinges on the marvelous brain work of a transcendent detective, give him a Dr. Watson to expatiate on it and to be awed by it. If a scientific or other straightforward recital of procedure, it may be told by the author. These points can best be learned and understood by reading the works of the best authors and noting what kind of narrator they choose and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-setting&quot;&gt;The Setting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting of the story will of course depend on the plot; but, other things being equal, do not choose too low life for your scenes. The facts of a murder are in themselves sufficiently unattractive to make it unnecessary to add to the distastefulness of the story by unpleasant surroundings. Let the people in your story be at least fairly well to do, of at least moderately good position and of a decent education. Unless absolutely necessary to have it otherwise, let the house or the scene of the crime be attractive or interesting, and let even the subordinate characters be of refined and intelligent type. For one reader who enjoys tales of slum life there are a dozen who prefer ladies and gentlemen, if not lords and ladies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be argued that murders or other crimes do not occur in high life as frequently as among the lower classes. This point may be open to discussion; but it would make no difference what the decision might be. Detective Stories are not realistic, and if the author choose to have his murder committed in a community of gentle-folk, he is entirely at liberty to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that the locality and social customs of the story must be those with which the author is familiar. A Detective Story depends so much on the logic and plausibility of its conditions, that a vague or uncertain touch on the practical or material details greatly mars the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us see to it, then, that our setting and our atmosphere are free from mistake or anachronism. Economy of attention demands that we keep the reader's mind wholly intent on the solution of the problem; and this may not be done if we allow questionable or contradictory work on the minor interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;  table-of-contents --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few requisites of a good detective story which the seasoned reader of that class of fiction demands. The following list does not cover the whole ground, but without these the writer cannot hope to interest the true lover of detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A good plot. The plot is the whole of a detective story. There may be character delineation, but it must be accidental. There may be sentiment, but it must be entirely subservient to the demands of the main plot. There may be pathos, but it must assist, not interrupt, the plot current. It—the plot—is what we are reading the story for; all else is simply thrown in for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No superfluous characters. Every man, woman, and child, dog and darning needle, must have his, her, or its place in the plot, touching the other characters, or some of them, at all points, like the hexagons in a mosaic. No superfluous persons should be introduced merely as a blind; all must have use; and after it is all over, one must be able to look back, and perceive the raison d'etre of each one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A wrong clue. The reader must be led gently and fatuously on to think that he alone, of all readers, has the true solution—has caught the author napping, and discovered that which he has done his best to conceal. He must never be directed too plainly to the criminal, or he will take fright, and avoid that person of all others. Too much art is no art. But very cautiously must he be led to believe that he is smarter than the rest of the readers, and has seen through all the author's carefully planned subterfuges. Then, when he eagerly looks to the end for corroboration—with a pardonable smirk at his own insight—in one crash must the criminal be revealed—a person wholly other than the one he suspected.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only legitimate deception. The reader is entirely at the mercy of the author, and hence he is to be deceived only in a straightforward manner. The characters may be misled, each one in a different way if you will; but the reader is never to be told authoritatively a thing which turns out to be not true. This misleading a reader, causing him to feel justified in believing a thing which is afterward denied, has spoilt many an otherwise good piece of detective writing; notably, a late story by a talented detective writer, in which the reader was told in so many words that a certain child was undoubtedly a boy, when the event proved it to be a girl. You must never make a fool of the reader—though you can fool him all you like.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tragic plot. A murder is the only really enthralling subject for a detective story. There have been good stories written on less tragic themes, but they are few; and it is hard to get up an interest over the finding of a diamond ring, or the reason why some man's wife has the blues. There must be real interests at stake before all the varied paraphernalia of detection can be made interesting. And it must not be too blood-thirsty a murder—no great interest or sorrow must be felt over the deceased. He is simply the keystone of the arch—not attractive in himself, but simply useful and indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plenty of obstacles. Don't let the work of detection be too easy, the path too smooth. Let the detective's perspicacity fail, his carefully laid plans miscarry. Let him follow a clue for pages, only to find it leads to naught. Slowly and steadily he must advance, only after many failures must his wonderful cleverness be vindicated. For, of course, he must be wonderfully clever. Hamlet without the Dane would be exciting beside a detective story without a marvelous detective.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last, let me say—stick close to your theme. After leading the reader up to a pitch of excitement over the main occurrences, do not open another chapter, or part, on a totally different scene, and slowly and deliberately bring characters and events down to the place at which you left off. Let everything move with a rush, from the finding of the body to the discovery of the criminal, each character contributing his own particular thread to the seemingly inextricable tangle of the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, however seemingly inextricable, there must always be an inkling of the solution, a promise of the finale. The reader must not give up in despair, losing interest in the apparently clueless jumble. Keep him amused with his own private guess-work and conclusions, until you throw his little imaginings aside, and tell him all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, then, with the warp threads of your plot held firmly in place, forming the same straight lines from beginning to end, so weave in the woof of characters, events, obstacles, dilemmas, all with the skillful touch of the old rug-makers, revealing only one side to the eager onlooker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, when he thinks that he has caught the Master Idea, and that you are not so subtle a weaver after all, then, I say, suddenly, with a turn of the hand, turn over the finished fabric, revealing the hitherto hidden side, which is the right one, and the one on which each thread plays its part in the perfect design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h6&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h6&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;drawer&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method of the murder is a point to be carefully chosen and this consideration of course includes the weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shooting is perhaps the means most often used, with stabbing as a close second. If a shooting, the weapon is usually a revolver, or occasionally a rifle. In this case, care must be taken that the scene is out of doors; or, if indoors, in an isolated apartment or so placed that the report shall be out of hearing of the other characters, unless immediate discovery is intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various devices are used to keep the innocent characters from hearing the shooting. In one case only a half-charge of powder was put into a gun. In another, of recent date, a silent bullet was used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong point is always made of the evidence of the weapon, if it be found. But, as we have before hinted, do not persist in having the revolver marked with the initials of a perfectly innocent person, for this has come to be looked upon as a tacit acquittal. It is hackneyed, also, to have the pistol one of a pair, and trace it by means of its duplicate still reposing in its case in the criminal's library. Learn to avoid these over-worked devices, as there are surely plenty of others. If a pistol is your chosen weapon, treat it either inconspicuously, or in some novel and original fashion that will interest the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of a stabbing is principally that the weapon may be picked up at the moment, in a sudden impulse to kill; while a pistol usually implies a premeditated murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weapon picked up on the spot has the advantage of not necessitating its concealment after use, for it incriminates no one in particular. Oftenest this weapon is a dagger used as a paper cutter, and so lying at hand on a table. Or a dagger or sword which is one of a decorative group on the wall of the room. Another weapon which has crept into use of late y ears is the hatpin. This, though popular among writers, is implausible and in many cases impossible; for the average hatpin bends but does not break. Yet one author after another kills his victim by stabbing him with a hatpin which breaks off and disappears in the wound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would-be clever author caused his victim to fall violently forward (with his mouth conveniently open), and allow a hatpin held by a near-by lady to strike through the roof of his mouth and pierce his brain. The obliging hatpin broke off at just the right place, and as the lady concealed the head end, the point end of the fatal weapon was never discovered. This related incident is practically impossible and should not have been used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Spanish story called &quot;The Nail,&quot; by Pedro de Alargon, practically reverses this method. A large nail was driven into the victim's skull and accomplished its purpose immediately. The head of the nail was concealed by the man's thick hair, and all unsuspecting of villainy, three medical experts declared the man's death due to apoplexy. Nor were they entirely to blame, as the physical effects brought about by the nail were precisely the same as the conditions of death by apoplexy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nail is a horrible suggestion, but whatever weapon brings about violent death is necessarily horrible. It is wise to dwell on the physical details as little as possible. Granted a murder, there must be a method, and if the exigencies of the story demand a horrible method, so be it; but remember Poe's injunction, and when painting the decayed cheeses make them look as little like decayed cheeses as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poison is a method giving the author a wider scope and necessitating somewhat legs gruesome conditions. It is easier to administer poison than to shoot or stab. Poison may be given in food or drink, or introduced into medicine or administered in more ingenious and original ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this method is used, the author should study up on poisons and their effects, and not run the risk of making absurd mistakes in his text. Abstruse scientific information is not necessary; enough can be learned from an encyclopaedia or a medical dictionary; but the plausibilities must be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A favorite poison with writers who know little of the subject, is &quot;a curious Indian or Persian drug, which acts instantaneously and leaves no trace.&quot; This drug, with its various and unintelligible names, has been somewhat over-worked; but it is acceptable because of its mystery and it is useful because its description is so vague as to need no real knowledge of it on the part of the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot of a poison murder implies more complexities than a death by shooting or stabbing. The poisoner is a person of more ingenuity and is more anxious to escape discovery; and it also gives scope for treachery and deceit. Then, too, it has the advantage of allowing the detail of bloodshed to be omitted, thus making the scene less ghastly to sensitive minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drowning and strangling and chloroforming eliminate also the necessity for bloodshed, and have the added advantage of requiring no especial weapon; though the presence of the weapon, or the absence of one known to have been used, is a valuable asset to the mystery writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the principal means of murder are enumerated above, the various manifestations of these means are innumerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ambitious writer often strives to find some new and original way of committing a hackneyed crime. So far has this been carried, that the latest detective stories employ the use of cultures of typhoid or diphtheria to bring about the necessary demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such means are perfectly legitimate in detective fiction, and if detailed with accurate and correct scientific knowledge are convincing, though not picturesque. Sherlock Holmes, with his fancy for the bizarre, rarely is satisfied with a plain shooting or stabbing. He uses such means as a blunt weapon, pushing into the water, a venomous snake, a harpoon, a poker, charcoal fumes, and a fall from a steep precipice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Anna Katharine Green's best stories, &quot;Hand and Ring,&quot; employs the homely weapon of a billet of fire-wood. We are told at the outset that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Half the criminals are caught because they do make tracks and then resort to such extraordinary means to cover them up. The true secret of success in this line lies in striking your blow with a weapon picked up on the spot, and in choosing for the scene of your tragedy a thoroughfare where, in the natural course of events, other men will come and go and unconsciously tread out your traces, provided you have made any. This dissipates suspicion, or starts it in so many directions that justice is at once confused, if not ultimately baffled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sound principle of construction, and is the starting point of many of the best detective stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room,&quot; the author goes back to the primitive weapon of a mutton bone, and in the skillful hands of both author and criminal this weapon is truly dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An author's first plot almost invariably centers around a shooting or a stabbing affair. It is in his later efforts that he feels moved to vary his methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding crimes other than murder, we find that more depends on the setting. A robbery, however great the booty, must be made interesting by unusual characters or conditions, and must implicate the hero or other important characters to the danger point. The discovery of the wrong-doer must mean disgrace and disaster of the strongest sort. For your detective story fancier is an extremist; and, owing to the predominance of murder stories and capital punishment, a short imprisonment for a robbery seems tame by contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Moonstone&quot; is a robbery story, but it combines all the elements that make for a dramatic setting, and though not the main motive, it includes a murder, and also a suicide, incidentally in the plot. It is one of the very few full-sized novels built upon a robbery, and it required the peculiar genius of a Wilkie Collins to hold the reader's attention through its five hundred pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other crimes than those we have considered, such as forgery, arson, blackmail, etc., are used only by authors in search of a novelty. They fancy that these crimes will interest because they are not so hackneyed as murder and robbery. But unless worked up with great care as to atmosphere and technique, stories of these crimes often prove dull reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some authors incline to such subjects as Nihilism and the workings of secret societies. These are not of such general interest as the ones we have been discussing, but they offer picturesque possibilities and scope for melodrama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;drawer&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having decided upon our characters, our crime, and our weapon, let us consider next the motive for the crime. Of course in all crimes except murder, the motive is obvious; for who would commit a robbery except to obtain the booty? Who would commit arson except with the intent of destroying property?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in a murder story the motive is one of the principal parts of the mystery. It has been said that there are only three motives for murder: money, love and revenge. While this is true in a general way, there are many other specific motives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mr. Train's book, &quot;Courts, Criminals and the Camorra,&quot; there is a most interesting chapter devoted to this question of motive. Though it is impossible to quote it all, we will refer to his published record compiled by a man who had been trying murder cases for ten years. Several pages tell the details of the record, but a concise summing up is also given. We are told, &quot;Out of the sixty-two homicides recorded, there were seventeen cold-blooded murders, with deliberation and premeditation; three homicides due to negligence; five committed while perpetrating a felony; thirty-seven manslaughters, due in sixteen cases to quarrels, thirteen to drink, four to disputes over money, three to women, one to race antagonism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further classification is given, and the whole chapter, indeed, the whole book, should be read by every writer of detective fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a small percentage, however, of recorded murders are adaptable to fiction plots. A study of the causes of real murders is useful, if one has discrimination in choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motive in fiction must be picturesque if possible, and interesting in any case. We care little what ruffian murdered another in a back alley; but we are intensely curious to know who killed Mr. Leavenworth or the Widow Lerouge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting motives are doubtless money, love and revenge; but the ramifications of these include hate, jealousy, greed, safety, ambition, inheritance and many others—in fact, the whole category of human emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally there is what might be called a freakish motive, such as the homicidal mania of The Whispering Man; or the curious motive of the criminal in the &quot;Big Bow Mystery.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these are sporadic instances. The soundest motives are the best, and in most cases the soundest are the simplest. Murder is the result of one of the most primitive impulses in man; and though the working out of the plot may be subtle, it is wise, so far as is possible, to have the motive simple, straightforward and strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If consistent with the plot, let the motive be of recent date. It is annoying to discover at the end of the book that the motive is retaliation for a wrong done thirty or forty years ago, as in &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; or &quot;Hand and Ring.&quot; These, otherwise perfect and really great detective stories, finally reveal motives which could not possibly be discovered by the reader, however much he might guess at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the motive be as carefully concealed as you like, but offer adroit hints and veiled allusions that the astute reader may catch if he can, and when at last the motive is revealed, let it be a logical and sound one, and, above all, let it be adequate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not difficult to account for the steady popularity of the detective story. The pleasure to be had from a good one is of a unique and satisfying kind. The reader is invited to take part in a mathematical demonstration, in which the symbols are men and women, with just enough of the background of life to give them reality. The problem to be solved is one of human conduct, and the solution is reached when one has found X, the unknown quantity — usually the criminal. The task which the author must accomplish is to give his readers all the data of the problem, and yet to solve it before they do. All the data, mind you, or he is not playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interest of a detective story is therefore intellectual and not emotional. There is no love interest — or, at most, a very slight one. For the problem is not to bring two loving hearts together, but to land the guilty man in jail. To attempt a love interest is to run every risk of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the detective story has always been held to be a man's story rather than a woman's. But times change; and women, certainly, are changing with them. They are still creatures of the emotions, and no doubt always will be, but they are coming to have their moments of intellectual detachment. Also, they no longer faint at the sight of blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writer has been in charge of a public library for twelve years, and one of the most interesting features of that work has been to watch the changes in the taste of the reading public. It has been full of surprises and contradictions, of almost unbelievable whims and vulgarities, but one thing can be said of it with confidence: interest in detective fiction has been steadily growing, among women even more than among men. Today, in the library, leaving adolescents out of the question, there are almost as many women as men who ask to have a detective story recommended to them. Perhaps this is a symptom of their emancipation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is that the supply no longer equals the demand. Oh, yes, there are plenty of detective stories — but how few that one can recommend as entirely satisfying. The writer has read nearly all that have appeared during the past ten years, and yet not more than six or eight have left any abiding impression. Aside from the Sherlock Holmes stories, there are only three that provoked re-reading, and on the spur of the moment it is impossible to recall the name of the detective in any of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, among all the detectives, amateur and professional, who have appeared before the public and performed their little tricks, there are only four who are classic — C. Auguste Dupin, Tabaret, M. Lecoq, and Sherlock Holmes. These abide. Beside them, the others are mere shadows. And these four are memorable not because they never bungled, not because occasionally they struck home with a cleverness and certainty which makes us forgive their mistakes. Their supreme moments are moments to be remembered with delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were their supreme moments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;supreme-moments-of-detective-fiction&quot;&gt;Supreme Moments of Detective Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Dupin, it was undoubtedly the moment when, standing before the window of the house in the Rue Morgue, he told himself that the nail which seemed to secure it could not really do so. It was a question, you will remember, of how the assassin of the two women had escaped. He could not have gone by the door, since there were some people on the stair, nor by the chimney, since it was too narrow, nor by the front windows, since there was a crowd in the street outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careful search had failed to disclose a secret exit. Therefore, Dupin reasoned, the fugitive must have passed through one of the two windows in the back room. But each of them was apparently secured on the inside by a stout nail fitted into a gimlet-hole in the sash. Let Dupin tell the rest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The murderers did escape from one of these windows. This being so, they could not have re-fastened the sashes from the Inside as they were found fastened. Yet the sashes were fastened. They must then have the power of fastening themselves. There was no escape from this conclusion. I stepped to the unobstructed casement, withdrew the nail with some difficulty, and attempted to raise the sash. It resisted all my efforts. A concealed spring must, I now knew, exist. A careful search soon brought it to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively. A person passing out through the window might have reclosed it, and the spring would have caught; but the nail could not have been replaced. The assassin must, then, have escaped through the other window. Supposing the springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there must be found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes of their fixture. Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked over the headboard minutely at the second casement. Passing my hand down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring, which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbour. I now looked at the nail. It was as stout as the other, and apparently fitted in the same manner, driven in nearly up to the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You will say that I was puzzled; but if you think so, you must have misunderstood the nature of the inductions. To use a sporting phrase, I had not once been &quot;at fault.&quot; The scent had never for an instant been lost. There was no flaw in any link of the chain. I had traced the secret to its ultimate result; and that result was the nail. It had, I say, in every respect the appearance of its fellow in the other window; but this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive as it might seem to be) when compared with the consideration that here at this point terminated the clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;There must be something wrong,&quot; I said, &quot;about the nail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I touched it, and the head, with about a quarter of an inch of the shank, came off in my fingers. The rest of the shank was in the gimlet-hole, where it had been broken off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quotation has been made at length because this bit of reasoning is as coherent and closely knit as any detective story can show. In fact, &lt;em&gt;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&lt;/em&gt; is in many ways the most satisfactory of all detective stories. The device of the newspaper advertisement to discover the identity of the criminal is one which Sherlock Holmes used many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet there are weak points even in this classic. In the first place, there are too many clues. The strange voice of the assassin and the unusual method of the murders should have been clues enough. When Dupin finds a tuft of hair between the fingers of one of the victims and afterward picks up a piece of greasy ribbon at the foot of the lightning rod by which the murderer escaped, the sense of fair play rebels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when Dupin goes on to explain that the knot tied in this ribbon is one peculiar to Maltese sailors, one becomes utterly incredulous. It is unlikely that there is a knot peculiar to Maltese sailors; and even if there were, why should Dupin happen to know it? In a word, the incident is most improbable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For, mind you, the writer of detective stories, in developing his plot, must keep within the probable — indeed, he should keep within the very probable. In life, everything is possible, no coincidence is incredible, and chance is always to be reckoned with. But in fiction, coincidence must be used most sparingly, nothing may be left to chance, and to say that, in its working out, a detective story is possible but not probable is to damn it. This does not refer to the initial situation; the more unusual that is the better, provided the explanation is adequate; but its development must impress the reader as inevitable, and the denouement must be the only one which fits all the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one other particular in which Dupin strains the reader's faith. It is not easy to believe that he could have followed the train of thought passing through his companion's mind, as Poe makes him do in the first part of the Rue Morgue story. Sherlock Holmes, probably in a spirit of rivalry, tries the same feat with Watson on two occasions; Watson is impressed, but it is doubtful if anyone else is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One point more. It must be confessed that the psychology of &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot; does not entirely convince; but admitting that it is so — admitting that, in order to conceal the letter which the police sought, the thief would resort to &quot;the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all&quot; — it is certain that he would not have proceeded as Poe makes him do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letter, it will be remembered, had been thrust into a card-rack, where it remained within full view of every one entering the thief's library. But, before being placed there, it had been put in a soiled and crumpled envelope, torn nearly in two, bearing a large black seal and addressed in a woman's hand to the thief. Surely it is evident that this soiled, crumpled and torn envelope, so out of place in a well-ordered apartment, would have attracted attention and awakened curiosity, and that a smooth, unsoiled, untorn envelope would have been far less likely to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Purloined Letter,&quot; however, gives us for the first time what has since become one of the stock situations of the detective story — that of the regular police, baffled and mystified, seeking the advice and assistance of the astute amateur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;six-words-sum-up-the-science-of-detection-it-must-be-all-or-nothing&quot;&gt;Six Words Sum Up the Science of Detection: It Must Be All or Nothing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty years after Poe's death, Émile Gaboriau began that series of detective stories which still remain, on the whole, the best of their class. There is probably no scene more satisfying than that in which Tabaret arrives at the place of the murder in &lt;em&gt;The Lerouge Case&lt;/em&gt;, and, after a short investigation, proceeds to reconstruct the crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, plainly, is the genesis of Sherlock Holmes, and yet Holmes never quite rose to this height. And it is in this story that Tabaret reaches his supreme moment — the moment when, after having bound his chain about his victim, assured that there is not a single weak link in it, he sees it shiver to pieces. The accused man has been arrested, has been taken before a magistrate, and, although stunned and incoherent, has doggedly asserted his innocence, but has as doggedly refused to say where he was on the night of the crime. Finally he is led away and Tabaret enters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I have come,&quot; he says, &quot;to know if any investigations are necessary to demolish the alibi pleaded by the prisoner.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;He pleaded no alibi,&quot; the magistrate replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What? No alibi!&quot; cries the detective. &quot;He has, of course, then, confessed everything.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No, he has confessed nothing. He acknowledges that the proofs are decisive: he cannot give an account of how he spent his time, but he protests his innocence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tabaret is thunderstruck — and reaches his supreme moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Not an alibi!&quot; he murmurs. &quot;No explanations! It is inconceivable! We must then be mistaken: he cannot be the criminal. That is certain!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magistrate laughs at him, and Tabaret explains that the man who committed this crime, so carefully planned, so cleverly carried out, so audacious and yet so prudent, would, under no circumstances, have failed to provide himself with a convincing alibi, and that a man who has no alibi cannot possibly be the criminal. Still the magistrate laughs, and Tabaret proceeds to lay down a principle which all writers of detective fiction would do well to learn by heart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Given a crime, with all the circumstances and details, I construct, bit by bit, a plan of accusation, which I do not guarantee until it is entire and perfect. If a man is found to whom this plan applies exactly in every particular, the author of the crime is found; otherwise one has laid hands upon an innocent person. It is not sufficient that such and such particulars seem to point to him; it must be all or nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those six words sum up the whole science of detection: it must be all or nothing. The writer himself dreams of someday writing a story in which the edifice of conviction is slowly and carefully built, four-square, like the frame of a sky-scraper, with every beam tested and every bolt rivetted, formidable and apparently impregnable, yet with a tiny hidden defect which, just as the last bolt is being placed, brings the whole structure smashing to the ground. That would be worth doing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;clues-subtle--convincing-clues-absurd--illogical&quot;&gt;Clues Subtle &amp;amp; Convincing; Clues Absurd &amp;amp; Illogical&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Lerouge case, Tabaret built such an edifice; but Gaboriau carries coincidence too far. It is admissible that both the real murderer and the man suspected of the crime should, on that particular evening, have been carrying an umbrella and wearing a high hat; perhaps it is admissible, since they are the same age and about the same build, that their shoes should be of the same size and shape; but when the author equips them both with lavender kid gloves he adds one coincidence too many. In his desire to strengthen the chain of evidence, he overleaps himself and loses the confidence of the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of clues is a most difficult one, for every writer of detective fiction is faced by this dilemma: The really astute, competent and thoughtful criminal should leave no clues, and yet, if none are left, it is impossible to apprehend him. A most instructive paper could be written upon this subject, for there are legitimate and illegitimate clues — clues subtle and convincing, and clues absurd and illogical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pause only to state one axiom: in fiction, at least, the name on the card found beside the murdered man is never that of the murderer, and the writer who seeks to fool the reader by any such clumsy device is many, many years behind the times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tabaret has a worthy pupil in M. Lecoq, although it should not be forgotten that he remains a pupil, with many things unlearned, to the end of the chapter. Sherlock Holmes's gibe at him seems to be the result of an unworthy envy. For Lecoq, though inferior to Tabaret, is far greater than Holmes — more picturesque, more subtle, more resourceful — and with a sense of humour. Probably his greatest moment occurs in &lt;em&gt;The Mystery of Orcival&lt;/em&gt;. A murder has been committed and a house ransacked, the furniture upset, the clock thrown from the mantel. It has stopped at twenty minutes past three, and to everyone it seems evident that it was at that hour the crime occurred. Lecoq replaces the clock on the mantel, and slowly pushes forward the minute-hand to halfpast three. The clock strikes eleven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a great idea — so great that no one will ever dare use it again without acknowledging its source. Sherlock Holmes came perilously near it, once, when he solved a mystery by re-winding a watch. But the honours belong to Gaboriau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for another thing the Frenchman deserves all praise. He recognised the fact that, to hold the interest, it is not enough that a crime should be committed and the criminal in the end discovered. There must be something more than that. There must be a war of intellect, a clash of theories. There must be confronting investigators, one seeking to establish a man's guilt, the other to establish his innocence. For the reader, the real pleasure is in following, step by step, this contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In so far as detective work goes, Gaboriau's stories are far better than Conan Doyle's; but Gaboriau tried to do too much. He sought to add a love interest, and in that respect he failed. Every one of his tales is built upon the threadbare formula, &quot;cherchez la femme&quot;; every one turns back for its motive to an illicit love affair. The writer avows that he has no patience with a plot which, for its explanation, must go back two or three generations; so these portions of Gaboriau's stories are to be skimmed rapidly, until Tabaret or Lecoq appears again upon the scene. Then not a word is to be missed. &lt;em&gt;Amat Tabaret!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;holmes-puerile-deductions--other-errors-of-conan-doyles-detective&quot;&gt;Holmes' Puerile Deductions &amp;amp; Other Errors of Conan Doyle's Detective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings one to Sherlock Holmes — whom one does not love. Indeed, it is not always easy to respect him. Wholly deplorable are those puerile &quot;deductions&quot; with which so many of the stories open. And in the whole series of his adventures, only three or four great moments can be recalled. His greatest, unquestionably, is in &quot;Silver Blaze,&quot; one of the best of the stories. Silver Blaze, the favourite for the Wessex Cup, has disappeared, having been taken from his stable at night, while the boy on guard is sleeping off the effects of a dose of opium. His trainer has been found in a depression in the moor near by with his skull smashed in and a peculiar thin-bladed knife in his hand, such a knife as is used in the very delicate operation for cataract. Here is the great moment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we stepped into the carriage, one of the stable lads held the door open for us. A sudden idea seemed to occur to Holmes, for he leaned forward and touched the lad upon the sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;You have a few sheep in the paddock,&quot; he said. &quot;Who attends to them?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I do, sir.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Have you noticed anything amiss with them of late?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, sir, not of much account; but three of them have gone lame, sir.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was, as Holmes afterward remarks, a long shot, but it hit the bull's-eye, for Silver Blaze's trainer, before trying to nick the tendon which was to lame him, had been practising on the sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writer has reread the Sherlock Holmes stories recently, but did not enjoy them as much as he anticipated. They do not wear as well as Gaboriau's, and the reason probably is because they are so very British — so stolid, so heavy, so lacking in humour. There is none of that nimbleness of phrase which so often illuminates Gaboriau's; the occasional flippant references to &quot;noble lords&quot; are a form of snobbery far more detestable than hearty admiration for the nobility as such; there is no wit — not a single chuckle in the whole series!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holmes sometimes attempts to be witty, but the attempts provoke tears rather than laughter. He says &quot;Ha!&quot; when he is surprised or excited — changed in the later stories to the still more irritating, &quot;Halloa! halloa! halloa!&quot; He affects a light touch now and then, with a result positively elephantine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Watson! The most damning indictment against Holmes, as a man of discernment and imagination, is that he was able to endure Watson! Even to enjoy his company! Of course the foil to your principal must be something of a fool; but surely it is not necessary to make him a portentous jackass! Watson's questions and exclamations set the teeth on edge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;My dear Holmes!&quot; &quot;Good God! what can it mean?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;How on earth … !&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, on second thought, it is evident that Holmes was not entirely wrong when he remarked that he had never met a man more eminently fitted to represent a British jury!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one respect, a re-reading has caused a modification of the estimate of the relative merits of these stories. The writer had always believed that the earlier ones were the best, but now it seems that the stories grouped under &lt;em&gt;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&lt;/em&gt; are as good as any, and better than most. &quot;The Norwood Builder,&quot; &quot;The Six Napoleons&quot; and &quot;The Golden Pince-Nez&quot; are all first rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in the last named, Holmes touches a height but little short of &quot;Silver Blaze.&quot; A man has been killed, and a pair of gold-framed glasses are found in his hand. They are of unusual strength, so that it is evident that their owner's eyes are very defective. In entering and in leaving the house, the assassin is supposed by the police to have walked along a narrow grass border between a path and a flower-bed in order to leave no footprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holmes, coming upon the scene, remarks that this is most extraordinary. On entering the house, he perceives that the floor of the corridor leading to the room where the crime was committed is covered with cocoanut matting. There is another corridor, of similar width, leading on into the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I understand,&quot; says Holmes, &quot;that this other passage leads only to the Professor's room. There is no exit that way?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;No, sir,&quot; replies the police officer, Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We shall go down it,&quot; Holmes proceeds, &quot;and make the acquaintance of the Professor. Holloa, Hopkins! this is very important, very important, indeed! The Professor's corridor is also lined with cocoanut matting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, sir, what of that?&quot; Hopkins asks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holmes refuses to explain at the time, but it had occurred to him at once that the assassin, fleeing from the room, half-blinded by the loss of the glasses, might very easily have taken the wrong corridor and gone on into the house, instead of escaping from it. Which, of course, proves to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the stories, the one whose start the writer likes best is &quot;The Red-Headed League,&quot; but its conclusion is utterly commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most ingenious is &quot;The Naval Treaty,&quot; with &quot;The Man with the Twisted Lip&quot; a close second. The most outré is &quot;The Speckled Band.&quot; The most obvious, from an American point of view, at least, is &quot;The Five Orange Pips.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to believe that even such a dunderhead as Watson should never have heard of Ku Klux Klan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">Among all the detectives, amateur and professional, who have appeared before the public and performed their little tricks, there are only four who are classic — C. Auguste Dupin, Tabaret, M. Lecoq, and Sherlock Holmes. These abide. Beside them, the others are mere shadows. And these four are memorable not because they never bungled, not because occasionally they struck home with a cleverness and certainty which makes us forgive their mistakes. Their supreme moments are moments to be remembered with delight.</summary>

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-artistic-merit-of-the-detective-story&quot;&gt;The Artistic Merit of the Detective Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In attempting to reach the genuine psychological reason for the popularity of detective stories, it is necessary to rid ourselves of many mere phrases. It is not true, for example, that the populace prefer bad literature to good, and accept detective stories because they are bad literature. The mere absence of artistic subtlety does not make a book popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bradshaw's Railway Guide contains few gleams of psychological comedy, yet it is not read aloud uproariously on winter evenings. If detective stories are read with more exuberance than railway guides, it is certainly because they are more artistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many good books have fortunately been popular; many bad books, still more fortunately, have been unpopular. A good detective story would probably be even more popular than a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble in this matter is that many people do not realize that there is such a thing as a good detective story; it is to them like speaking of a good devil. To write a story about a burglary is, in their eyes, a sort of spiritual manner of committing it. To persons of somewhat weak sensibility this is natural enough; it must be confessed that many detective stories are as full of sensational crime as one of Shakespeare's plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, between a good detective story and a bad detective story as much, or, rather more, difference than there is between a good epic and a bad one. Not only is a detective story a perfectly legitimate form of art, but it has certain definite and real advantages as an agent of the public weal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-essential-value-of-the-detective-story-the-poetry-of-modern-life&quot;&gt;The Essential Value of the Detective Story: The Poetry of Modern Life&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first essential value of the detective story lies in this, that it is the earliest and only form of popular literature in which is expressed some sense of the poetry of modern life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men lived among mighty mountains and eternal forests for ages before they realized that they were poetical; it may reasonably be inferred that some of our descendants may see the chimney-pots as rich a purple as the mountain-peaks, and find the lamp-posts as old and natural as the trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of this realization of a great city itself as something wild and obvious the detective story is certainly the &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt;. No one can have failed to notice that in these stories the hero or the investigator crosses London with something of the loneliness and liberty of a prince in a tale of elfland, that in the course of that incalculable journey the casual omnibus assumes the primal colours of a fairy ship. The lights of the city begin to glow like innumerable goblin eyes, since they are the guardians of some secret, however crude, which the writer knows and the reader does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every twist of the road is like a finger pointing to it; every fantastic skyline of chimney-pots seems wildly and derisively signalling the meaning of the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This realization of the poetry of London is not a small thing. A city is, properly speaking, more poetic even than a countryside, for while Nature is a chaos of unconscious forces, a city is a chaos of conscious ones. The crest of the flower or the pattern of the lichen may or may not be significant symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is no stone in the street and no brick in the wall that is not actually a deliberate symbol – a message from some man, as much as if it were a telegram or a post-card. The narrowest street possesses, in every crook and twist of its intention, the soul of the man who built it, perhaps long in his grave. Every brick has as human a hieroglyph as if it were a graven brick of Babylon; every late on the roof is as educational a document as if it were a slate covered with addition and subtraction sums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything which tends, even under the fantastic form of the minutiae of Sherlock Holmes, to assert this romance of detail in civilization, to emphasize this unfathomably human character in flints and tiles, is a good thing. It is good that the average man should fall into the habit of looking imaginatively at ten men in the street even if it is only on the chance that the eleventh might be a notorious thief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may dream, perhaps, that it might be possible to have another and higher romance of London, that men's souls have stranger adventures than their bodies, and that it would be harder and more exciting to hunt their virtues than to hunt their crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since our great authors (with the admirable exception of Stevenson) decline to write of that thrilling mood and moment when the eyes of the great city, like the eyes of a cat, begin to flame in the dark, we must give fair credit to the popular literature which, amid a babble of pedantry and preciosity, declines to regard the present as prosaic or the common as commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular art in all ages has been interested in contemporary manners and costume; it dressed the groups around the Crucifixion in the garb of Florentine gentlefolk or Flemish burghers. In the last century it was the custom for distinguished actors to present Macbeth in a powdered wig and ruffles. How far we are ourselves in this age from such conviction of the poetry of our own life and manners may easily be conceived by anyone who chooses to imagine a picture of Alfred the Great toasting the cakes dressed in tourist's knickerbockers, or a performance of &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt; in which the Prince appeared in a frock-coat, with a crepe band round his hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this instinct of the age to look back, like Lot's wife, could not go on forever. A rude, popular literature of the romantic possibilities of the modern city was bound to arise. It has arisen in the popular detective stories, as rough and refreshing as the ballads of Robin Hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, another good work that is done by detective stories. While it is the constant tendency of the Old Adam to rebel against so universal and automatic a thing as civilization, to preach departure and rebellion, the romance of police activity keeps in some sense before the mind the fact that civilization itself is the most sensational of departures and the most romantic of rebellions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;detectives-in-fiction-are-the-unsleeping-sentinels-who-guard-the-outposts-of-society&quot;&gt;Detectives in Fiction Are the Unsleeping Sentinels Who Guard the Outposts of Society&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By dealing with the unsleeping sentinels who guard the outposts of society, it tends to remind us that we live in an armed camp, making war with a chaotic world, and that the criminals, the children of chaos, are nothing but the traitors within our gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the detective in a police romance stands alone, and somewhat fatuously fearless amid the knives and fists of a thieves' kitchen, it does certainly serve to make us remember that it is the agent of social justice who is the original and poetic figure; while the burglars and footpads are merely placid old cosmic conservatives, happy in the immemorial respectability of apes and wolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The romance of the police force is thus the whole romance of man. It is based on the fact that morality is the most dark and daring of conspiracies. It reminds us that the whole noiseless and unnoticeable police management by which we are ruled and protected is only a successful knight-errantry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-hunt-for-mystery&quot;&gt;The Hunt for Mystery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original inventor of the legend of how a man sold himself to the Prince of Darkness, taking for his share of the bargain renewed youth and unbounded riches, certainly deserves to be awarded the palm for the most wondrous and mysterious plot that ever emanated from the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He must have been a deep thinker, one well versed in the philosophy of goose quill, knowing that his story would thrill the reader, and that he had achieved the great point of seizing upon that reader's imagination, and holding it, so that he would follow the mystery of the fiction to the very end. It may have been the result of some haphazard lucky thought, but still he must have been a careful student of every- day life, and must have duly noted how largely curiosity or the desire to fathom the unknown is developed in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible even to descend lower in the scale of creation and to find this quality in creatures which progress on four hands or four feet, and to note how frequently the hunter lures the unfortunate quarry to death by holding forth something novel to its gaze. But, setting aside the beast of the field, it is sufficient to recall how very soon in infant life a pair of little wondering eyes begin, in the nurse's parlance, &quot;to take notice,&quot; and how, before long, the use of the curious eyes is supplemented by a tiny, outstretched, feeling hand, trying to touch that something before it which is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The child grows, and with its growth the desire increases, and, to speak broadly, becomes an insatiable desire to know what is on the other side of the wall that he cannot climb. In his simplicity he is the Simon of nursery lore, who cut open his mother's bellows to see whence came the wind. A much-maligned youth, by the way; for his simplicity was only the natural thirst for knowledge of a mystery; and, after all, he was somewhat of a philosopher studying pneumatics, and possibly wiser than his judges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the ordinary Simon of every-day life matures and becomes versed in his many studies, we find him still seeking after the meanings of the many mysteries of life, and dabbling in science as chemist, or as astronomer, puzzling out the why and wherefore of the worlds around; perhaps even turning to occultism as an earnest student, or as a victim of the charlatan; and, above all, sooner or later, trying to dive into the mysteries of the great unknown—the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this strong passion to know the unknown that is seized upon by the writer of a certain class of fiction, who realizing the vastness of his audience, and calculating his probabilities in prizes to be won in the shape of notoriety, publisher's smiles, and their consequences, throws over his natural desires to follow out the so-called higher paths of literature with the delineation and analysis of character, and in the first pages of his work seeks to start his reader off upon the hunt after a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flaire is prepared, the scent is there, and the hunt for the elucidation begins. If cleverely arranged the hunter grows warmer and more breathless chapter by chapter, and at this rate he would soon run the mystery down; but he is carried off on false leads, disappointed, sent back to the true, and goes on with repetitions of the trick of which he is delightfully ignorant, till the last chapter is near, the quarry—the mystery—almost in sight, and finally, after a breathless chase, the aim of writer and reader is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-hidden-in-fiction-literary-devices-in-fiction&quot;&gt;The Hidden in Fiction: Literary Devices in Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without going back to the most ancient utilizers of the hidden in fiction, it is a far-enough cry from the &lt;em&gt;Mysteries of Udolpho&lt;/em&gt;, to the &lt;em&gt;Mysteries of a Hansom Cab&lt;/em&gt;; from secret passage, dark dungeon, and strange appearances, to murder most foul and unnatural. Between those two points how innumerable have been the devices adopted to catch the reader's attention!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A goodly list of literary devices might be catalogued from the thousands of stories poured forth from the press, and it is food for the student to watch the hold they take upon the ordinary—even upon the extraordinary—reader, who is easily attracted to the mystery chase if that mystery be good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be dressed with a curdling thrill like that of De Montepin, who starts his readers upon the trail of a horror in the cemetery of Père la Chaise, with the strange and gruesome idea suggestive of the natural, supernatural, and always of the ghastly—the discovery of a thin stream of blood issuing from beneath the stony door of one of the more pretentions tombs; or one of the ingenious complications full of the detective element contrived by Gaboriau or Boisgobey; or the mystery of a higher class arranged with its masterly sexual attractions, of the personage prisoned in the gloomy mansion who startled governess &lt;em&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/em&gt; with her nightly shrieks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, who amongst us was not fascinated by the fortunes of the beautiful bigamist whose first husband so mysteriously disappeared, and who did not long to penetrate &lt;em&gt;Lady Audley's Secret&lt;/em&gt;, even feeling ready to forgive its rather vapid ending for the sake of the enjoyment experienced while under the clever novelist's spell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have the well-used, never-failing mystery followed as intently in real life as in fiction, the unravelling of that poisoning case which, once begun, has a perfect magnetism for the reader, whose stimulated mind goads him or her on in the chase with piquant questions. For there is first the sufferer dying by inches from that unknown fell disease which baffles all the physicians' skill—that is, the fiction physicians—for they remain chapters long in utter ignorance of the mysterious ailment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the discovery: it is produced by poison. But what poison? The symptoms are new to science. No deadly drug in the pharmacopoeia would produce these effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could it have been administered?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By what means?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suggestions are many— so many little mysteries to make one big—and when it is settled that the victim is being slowly poisoned, comes the leading up to the questions of who could be the administrator, and for what reason is the unfortunate being gradually done to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is plenty of choice for the writer to gratify his reader: love, hatred, revenge, rivalry, hard cash, or, strongest of all—very telling this—for psychical reasons, to see a victim die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mystery is a strong card in the novelist's hand. By few has it been played with a skill like that of Wilkie Collins, who, with little characterization or sentiment, without creating individuals of fiction whom we remember, or whose sayings we quote, could hold the attention of the novel-reading world with his &lt;em&gt;Woman in White&lt;/em&gt;, or set them eagerly agog to find the whereabouts of the mysterious diamond taken from its Eastern sanctuary. For ingenuity of construction, blind leads, bafflings, and sustained interest &lt;em&gt;The Moonstone&lt;/em&gt; stands high in the catalogue of the mysteries of fiction; and the reader was penetrating to a degree who fastened upon Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite the theft, the point being most graphically and tragically revealed in the scene in the East End where he lay a corpse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not great, perhaps, this art of mystery in fiction, partaking as it does of the nature of a puzzle or conundrum; still it is ingenious though stagy, with its designing and fitting, and surely to be commended as an art worthy of a need of praise. Especially now that we have reached in reading a period when we are going through a transition stage which to the thoughtful is most marked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novels of a century or so back were manly but coarse, and many a clever work retains its place on the bookshelves on account of its being licensed in its licentiousness by the brand, or hall mark, &quot;classic.&quot; Then, as refinement obtained, we went through a phase of the morbidly sentimental, followed up by the sentimental romantic, which gave place in turn to productions of sterling worth lasting up to and continued in the present day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;mystery-novels-of-france&quot;&gt;Mystery Novels of France&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In company with all these, of course, there were the importations from across the Channel—clever, unprincipled, immoral, often filthy to a degree. In these, for the most part, the art of mystery was wanting. There was no room for it. The text was in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred sexuality. These had their readers naturally enough, but the hot-blooded exotic novel was neither popular nor plentiful. Now we have changed all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another French fashion has been imported; it has obtained its hold upon a largely increasing &lt;em&gt;clientèle&lt;/em&gt; of readers, and is dubbed the gospel of nature. By them the honest, straightforward is pooh-poohed; Scott is a bore, Dickens burlesque, Thackeray tiresome satire, George Eliot old-fashioned and dull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French novel, in short, a score or so of years ago, was read and not named; now it is read, and not only named but is answerable for a new school of novelists who base themselves upon their French masters and imitate them as nearly as they dare for there are reasons—patent reasons—not unconnected with circulation, which hinder the modern Gallicised writer from going as far as he probably would. We have held up to us as master-pieces of nature and realism, &lt;em&gt;Manon Lescaut&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Madame Bovary&lt;/em&gt;, and the sham philosophic but mighty efforts of a great brain/ the works of Zola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One casts no slur upon the ability of the writers of these romances. They are Frenchmen, of France, and their ways are not ours. But the insidious work is going on and is having its effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-mystery-in-the-hands-of-the-so-called-weaker-sex&quot;&gt;The Mystery in the Hands of the So-called Weaker Sex&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally our writers are ruled by the demand. The success of one brings forth many imitators, and the result is that many of the books now published, notably those written by the so-called weaker sex, grow broader and stronger—certainly in more senses than one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school of writers to whom we owe this advance, this imitative effort in letters, scorning the art of mystery in fiction, claim for their work that it is in its breadth and strength more masculine—they might add feminine, though the reader may wade through many a novel without finding a true woman—nothing but the animal feminine whom the Frank delights to portray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The influence is daily growing, and an example of its effects is plainly before us—an example almost ludicrous—for we find one of our principal newspapers giving its assurance (in answer to certain rumors) that the novel appearing in its columns has not been expurgated, but is exactly as it came from the novelist's pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;sensationalism-in-the-mystery&quot;&gt;Sensationalism in the Mystery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might expect that with the advance of this class of narrative with naturalism so strongly to the fore, the old school of sensationalism would be beaten out of the field, but though the new writer basing his fiction upon his French master may out-Herod Herod and cause a massacre among the innocents he contemns, the mystery-lover will never be convinced, but will seek after his favorite food with as great a zest as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing repellent here; the natural desire to penetrate the occult is evoked, and in this lies the power which has won for many a work utterly wanting in truth to nature, plausibility and literary style—a work in fact of the most crude and rugged type—a fabulous circulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be invidious to name such books, to pose as a judge, and give what at best would be only one opinion, but the question must have been asked by many a reader how it was that such farragoes of impossibilities—such tragi-burlesque played by abortive imitations of human life—could have enthralled their hundreds of thousands, and kept their attention from the beginning to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple. It is the mystery of the story and the curiosity excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These have a peculiar charm for most readers—most, for a tale of this kind with an ingenious, well-constructed plot partakes somewhat of the nature of the fabled Maelstrom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-popular-sensation-story&quot;&gt;The Popular Sensation Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the lover of the vapid style of society novel, or of those dealing with afternoon calls and tea, liberally amalgamated with upholstery and the latest fashions; the lady worshipper of the athletic giants who crush the gentle violets of society and break hearts because it is their nature to, and consequently go on macadamizing their life path with these brittle objects so liberally offered to them—in novels; the patron of the libraries who is content with nothing less than character-studies, analysis of life, struggles against temptation, sexual or religious infidelity, stories of pure-minded church dignitaries fighting against doubt, or Barham's worst devil of all—the &quot; laughing woman with two bright eyes,&quot; and who go through three volumes representing in Book I. the flitting fly, in Book II. the contact with the web and the vain struggles, and in Book III. the rescue and cleansing of the tangled wings by faith, fighting or death; all these readers fall at times to the ordinary mystery in fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their nature is too strong for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover of the popular-sensation story is lifted with possibly a smile of contempt for the people who can &quot;devour such stuff,&quot; and of course just to skim a few pages to see what it may be like. Or it may he by accident, for want of something better to hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a few lines are read, and could the ingenious writer be looking on, and always supposing that in cleverness of construction and freshness of idea the story is one of the best of its class, he too could have his smile for the great-browed deep thinker and student of the higher questions and theories of the nineteenth century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the reader has placed one foot in the literary whirlpool, the other follows, and in the vast majority of cases complete immersion ensues; he starts on his career round and round, lost to everything but the insidious curiosity-exciting plot of the book, till the brain hunger is excited, and with the desire thoroughly piqued, he reads on to the very end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the book is thrown down—possibly with a contemptuous, &quot;What trash!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One joins issue here. Is it such trash when it has been so constructed and so written that it has kept the reader's brain spellbound, held the attention not only for the time occupied in reading three ordinary library volumes, but often in a tantalized state from month to month—six, or even twelve—when the work has appeared in periodical or magazine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These effects are produced by a combination of nature and art; nature worked upon by art most artfully; but it is given to few—this power of piquing a reader's brain. Once touched, though, the novelist has a wonderful ally in his victim, who colors up the pictures, and represents them to his mind's eye to suit his own taste, and often renders that which is dull bright in the extreme—to himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-young-reader-to-the-mysterious-bones&quot;&gt;The Young Reader to the Mysterious Bones&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might exemplify how strongly this is the case in many of the stories of adventure that have been written for boys, which, so to speak, have been merely skeletons—hard, dry bones, but well set up, strong, and perfectly articulated. Every joint has been carefully placed, and the form is without a flaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then comes the young reader to the mysterious bones, eager and full of curiosity. His vivid young imagination begins to work, and in a very short time that skeleton is clothed by him—not by the author—with elastic tendon, vigorous muscle, and a color of which the writer has hardly dreamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skeleton is alive and full of action, while the scene in which it begins to move and have its being impresses itself so upon the soft wax of the youthful imagination that it lasts there unabraded by a life of toil and care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, though in a less degree, the adult reader, albeit his or her brain is a little thicker in its &lt;em&gt;pia&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;dura mater&lt;/em&gt;, and more difficult to impress, also helps the author in his work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-natural-desire-for-the-weird-and-wonderful&quot;&gt;The Natural Desire for the Weird and Wonderful&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One who has studied these questions from many points of view, and, above all, noted how a story will &quot;catch on,&quot; and almost electrically seize the imagination of the reading world, will constantly see that in the majority of cases the most popular fiction of the day is that in which mystery plays a prominent part—a mystery which is well concealed. It is no secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There as aforesaid is the natural desire for the weird and wonderful—that hunger for the knowledge of the unknown which began with the forbidden apple; and the practiser of the art in question merely grows for those who hunger a fruit that is goodly to the eye, agreeable to the taste, and one that if he—or she—be worthy of the honored name of author, should only contain in its seeds a sufficiency of hydrocyanic poison to make it piquant in its savor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no forbidden fruit that he should offer, only an apple that is hard to pick, now within the grasp, now hidden amongst the leaves of the bright garden in which the reader is lured to stray, and rest and refresh, away from life's marking care—a fruit whose first bite excites fresh desire, whose taste brings forth an intense longing for more, and of which the choicest and most enticing morsel is cleverly held back to the very end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;principles-of-writing-detective-tales&quot;&gt;Principles of Writing Detective Tales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a well-known fact that people who have never succeeded in anything end by writing books about how to succeed; and I do not see why the principle should not be applied to success in the writing of detective tales as well as in lower and less glorious walks of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before offering any criticism in the matter of mystery stories, I think it only fair to confess that I have myself written some of the worst mystery stories in the world. But, if I have achieved the lowest results, I might very well claim to have had the loftiest motive, for I acted on the divine principle of the Golden Rule. I did unto others as I would they would do unto me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I provided them with more stories about crime, in the faint hope that they in turn might provide me with more stories about crime. I cast my mystery on the waters, so to speak, hoping it might return to me after many days, with a totally different title and a much better tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the detective novel the division of labour is sharply drawn between the reader and the novelist. Perhaps it may be pointedly answered that the heavier part of the labour falls on the reader. Perhaps it is true, especially in those melancholy examples to which I have darkly referred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, anyhow, such a division does exist in the very nature of the detective story. If you write it, you cannot read it. If you want to read, it you must not be so ill-advised as to write it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that I cannot be thunderstruck at the end with a revelation which I have planned from the very beginning; nor can I be bewildered and inquisitive about the concealment of something which I am myself labouring to conceal. I cannot myself stagger with astonishment on learning that the Bishop has been a brigand, if I have myself elaborately disguised the brigand as a Bishop. The poet can sing his song, but the sensational writer cannot be shocked at his shocker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I am moved to dogmatise about detective stories, partly because I see everywhere the advertisements of the dramatic version of one of the best of detective stories, &quot;The Yellow Room,&quot; and partly because I have just read again that excellent French story in its original form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not seen the play itself, but I hear it is a great success, though it by no means follows, from the nature of the problem, that a good mystery story will make a good play. Indeed, the two things in the abstract are almost antagonistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two methods of concealment are exactly contrary, for the drama depends on what was called the Greek irony – that is, on the knowledge of the audience, and not ignorance of the audience. In the detective story it is the hero (or villain) who knows, and the outsider who is deceived. In the drama it is the outsider (or spectator) who knows, and the hero who is deceived. The one keeps a secret from the actors, and the other from the audience. Nevertheless, the thing has been done successfully in one or two cases, and very probably in this case also. But the re-reading of the story itself, as well as of any amount of inferior stories of the same kind, has moved me to throw out some general suggestions about the true principles of this popular form of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not mean to speak in any superior fashion of the inferior stories. I am very fond of trash; I have read a great deal of it – I have also written a great deal of it. But even in this department there is trash and trash; and we might be more easily amused if our idlest entertainers understood how to amuse us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;fallacies-about-the-nature-of-the-true-mystery-story&quot;&gt;Fallacies About the Nature of the True Mystery Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are certain fallacies about the nature of the true mystery story which I perceive to be common among the writers as well as the readers of it. But I should like it to be understood that it is in the comparatively proud and honourable character of a reader of such stories, and not in the lower and more servile capacity of a writer of them, that I venture to indicate such errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, there is evidently a very general idea that the object of the detective novelist is to baffle the reader. Now, nothing is easier than baffling the reader, in the sense of disappointing the reader. There are many successful and widely advertised stories of which the principle simply consists in thwarting information by means of incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bulgarian governess is just about to mention her real reason for concealing herself with a loaded rifle inside the grand piano, when a yellow Chinaman leaps through the window and cuts off her head with a yataghan; [A yataghan is a Turkish scimitar with a double curved blade.] and this trivial interruption is allowed to defer the elucidation of the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it is quite a simple matter to fill several volumes with adventures of this thrilling kind, without permitting the reader to advance a step in the direction of discovery. This is illegitimate, on the fundamental principles of this form of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not merely that it is not artistic, or that it is not logical. It is that it is not really exciting. People cannot be excited except about something; and at this stage of ignorance the reader has nothing to be excited about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are thrilled by knowing something, and on this principle they know nothing. The true object of an intelligent detective story is not to baffle the reader, but to enlighten the reader; but to enlighten him in such a manner that each successive portion of the truth comes as a surprise. In this, as in much nobler types of mystery, the object of the true mystic is not merely to mystify, but to illuminate. The object is not darkness, but light; but light in the form of lightning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-common-error-of-characters-in-detective-stories&quot;&gt;The Common Error of Characters in Detective Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the common error of making all the human characters sticks, or stock figures – not so much because the novelist is not intelligent enough to describe real characters as because he really thinks real characterization wasted on an unreal type of literature. In other words, he does the one thing which is destructive in every department of existence – he despises the work he is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the method is fatal to his mechanical object, even considered as a mechanical object. We cannot even be adequately thrilled by a whole secret society of assassins who have sworn to effect the death of a bore who is obviously better dead. And even in order that the novelist should kill people, it is first necessary that he should make them live. As a matter of fact, we may very well add the general principle that the most intense interest of a good mystery story does not consist in incident at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sherlock Holmes stories are very good working models of a workmanlike type of popular mystery. And the point of such a story is very seldom the story at all. The best part of it is the comedy of the conversations between Holmes and Watson; and that for the sound psychological reason that they are characters always, even when they are not actors at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if I venture on this rebuke to the popular novelist, I must balance it by a similar and yet more solemn rebuke to the psychological novelist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensational story-teller does indeed create uninteresting characters, and then try to make them interesting by killing them. But the intellectual novelist yet more sadly wastes his talents, for he creates interesting characters, and then does not kill them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I complain of in the advanced and analytical artist in fiction is that he describes some subtle character, full of modern moods and doubts; that he expends all his imagination on realising every fine shade of the sentiment and philosophy of the sceptic or the free lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, when the hero in question is at last alive and ready to be murdered, when he is in every detail of his character demanding and requiring, and, as it were, crying aloud to be murdered, the novelist does not murder him after all. This is a serious waste of a fine opportunity, and I hope in future to see the error rectified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I desire, this evening, to consider Fiction as one of the Fine Arts. In order to do this, and before doing it, I have first to advance certain propositions. They are not new, they are not likely to be disputed, and yet they have never been so generally received as to form part, so to speak, of the national mind. These propositions are three, though the last two directly spring from the first. They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That Fiction is an Art in every way worthy to be called the sister and the equal of the Arts of Painting, Sculpture, Music, and Poetry; that is to say, her field is as boundless, her possibilities as vast, her excellences as worthy of admiration, as may be claimed for any of her sister Arts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That it is an Art which, like them, is governed and directed by general laws; and that these laws may be laid down and taught with as much precision and exactness as the laws of harmony, perspective, and proportion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That, like the other Fine Arts, Fiction is so far removed from the mere mechanical arts, that no laws or rules whatever can teach it to those who have not already been endowed with the natural and necessary gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the three propositions which I have to discuss. It follows as a corollary and evident deduction that, these propositions once admitted, those who follow and profess the Art of Fiction must be recognized as artists, in the strictest sense of the word, just as much as those who have delighted and elevated mankind by music and painting; and that the great Masters of Fiction must be placed on the same level as the great Masters in the other Arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, I mean that where the highest point, or what seems the highest point, possible in this Art is touched, the man who has reached it is one of the world's greatest men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot suppose that there are any in this room who would refuse to admit these propositions; on the contrary, they will seem to most here self-evident; yet the application of theory to practice, of principle to persons, may be more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, so boundless is the admiration for great Masters such as Raphael or Mozart, that if one were to propose that Thackeray should be placed beside them, on the same level, and as an equal, there would ho felt by most a certain shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not suggesting that the art of Thackeray is to be compared with that of Raphael, or that there is any similarity in the work of the two men; I only say that, Fiction being one Art, and Painting another and a sister those who attain the highest possible distinction in either are equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us, however, go outside this room, among the multitudes by whom a novelist has never been considered an artist at all. To them the claim that a great novelist should be considered to occupy the same level as a great musician, a great painter, or a great poet, would appear at first a thing ludicrous and even painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider for a moment how the world at large regards the novelist. He is, in their eyes, a person who tells stories, just as they used to regard the actor as a man who tumbled on the stage to make the audience laugh, and a musician as a man who fiddled to make the people dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the old way of thinking, and most people think first as they have been taught to think; and next as they see others think. It is therefore quite easy to understand why the art of novel-writing has always been, by the general mass, undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, while the leaders in every other branch of Art, in every department of Science, and in every kind of profession, receive their share of the ordinary national distinctions, no one ever hears of honors being bestowed upon novelists. Neither Thackeray nor Dickens was ever, so far as I know, offered a Peerage; neither King, Queen, nor Prince in any country throughout the whole world takes the least notice of them. I do not say they would be any the better for this kind of recognition, but its absence clearly proves, to those who take their opinions from others, that they are not a class at all worthy of special honor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again, in the modern craze which exists for every kind of art — so that we meet everywhere, in every household, amateur actors, painters, etchers, sculptors, modellers, musicians, and singers, all of them serious and earnest in their aims — amateur novelists alone regard their Art as one which is learned by intuition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, novelists are not associated as are painters; they hold no annual exhibitions, dinners, or conversazioni; they put no letters after their name; they have no President or Academy; and they do not themselves seem desirous of being treated as folio were of a special Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not say that they are wrong, or that much would be gained for Art if all the novelists of England were invited to Court and created into a Royal Academy. But I do say that for these three reasons it is easy to understand how the world at large does not even suspect that the writing of novels is one of the Fine Arts, and why they regard the story-teller with a sort of contempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, I acknowledge, a kindly contempt — even an affectionate contempt; it is the contempt which the practical man feels for the dreamer, the strong man for the weak, the man who can do for the man who can only look on and talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general — the Philistine — view of the Profession is, first of all, that it is not one which a scholar and a man of serious views should take up: the telling of stories is inconsistent with a well-balanced mind; to be a teller of stories disqualifies one from a hearing on important subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this very day there are thousands of living people who will never understand how the author of &quot;Coningsby &quot; and &quot; Vivian Grey &quot; can possibly be regarded as a serious statesman — all the Disraeli literature, even to the comic cartoons, expresses the popular sentiment that a novelist must not presume to call himself a statesman; the intellect of a novelist, it is felt, if he have any intellect at all, which is doubtful, must be one of the most frivolous and lightest kind; how can a man whose mind is always full of the loves of Corydon and Amaryllis be trusted to form an opinion on practical matters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Thackeray ventured to contest the city of Oxford, we know what happened. He thought his failure was because the people of Oxford had never even heard of him; I think otherwise. I think it was because it was whispered from house to house and was carried from shop to shop, and was mentioned in the vestry, that this fellow from London, who asked for their votes, was nothing but a common novelist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these people must not be confounded another class, not so large, who are prepared to admit that Fiction is in some qualified sense an Art; but they do this as a concession to the vanity of its followers, and are by no means prepared to allow that it is an Art of the first rank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can that be an Art, they might ask, which has nolecturers or teachers, no school or college or Academy, no recognized rules, no text-books, and is not taught in any University? Even the German Universities, which teach everything else, do not have Professors of Fiction, and not one single novelist, so far as I know, has ever pretended to teach his mystery, or spoken of it as a thing which may be taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, therefore, they would go on to argue, such art as is required for the making and telling of a story can and must be mastered without study, because no materials exist for the student's use. It may even, perhaps, be acquired unconsciously or by imitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view, I am sorry to say, largely prevails among the majority of those who try their chance in the field of fiction. Anyone, they think, can write a novel; therefore, why not sit down and write one? I would not willingly say one word which might discourage those who are attracted to this branch of literature; on the contrary, I would encourage them in every possible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One desires, however, that they should approach their work at the outset with the same serious and earnest appreciation of its importance and its difficulties with which they undertake the study of music and painting. I would wish, in short, that from the very beginning their minds should be fully possessed with the knowledge that Fiction is an Art, and, like all other Arts, that it is governed by certain laws, methods, and rules, which it is their first business to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is then, first and before all, a real Art. It is the oldest, because it was known and practised long before Painting and her sisters were in existence or even thought of; it is older than any of the Muses from whose company she who tells stories has hitherto been excluded; it is the most widely spread, because in no race of men under the sun is it unknown, even though the stories may be always the same, and handed down from generation to generation in the same form; it is the most religious of all the Arts, because in every age until the present the lives, exploits, and sufferings of gods, goddesses, saints, and heroes have been the favorite theme; it has always been the most popular, because it requires neither culture, education, nor natural genius to understand and listen to a story; it is the most moral, because the world has always been taught whatever little morality it possesses by way of story, fable, apologue, parable, and allegory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It commands the widest influence, because it can be carried easily and everywhere, into regions where pictures are never seen and music is never heard; it is the greatest teaching power, because its lessons are most readily apprehended and understood. All this, which might have been said thousands of years ago, may be said today with even greater force and truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That world which exists not, but is an invention or an imitation— that world in which the shadows and shapes of men move about before our eyes as real as ifthey were actually living and speaking among us, is like a great theatre accessible to all of every sort, on whose stage are enacted, at our own sweet will, whenever we please to command them, the most beautiful plays; it is, as every theatre should be, the school in which manners are learned; here the majority of reading mankind learn nearly all that they know of life and manners, of philosophy and art; even of science and religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern novel converts abstract ideas into living models; it gives ideas, it strengthens faith, it preaches a higher morality than is seen in the actual world; it commands the emotions of pity, admiration, and terror; it creates and keeps alive the sense of sympathy; it is the universal teacher; it is the only book which the great mass of reading mankind ever do read; it is the only way in which people can learn what other men and women are like; it redeems their lives from dulness, puts thoughts, desires, knowledge, and even ambitions into their hearts; it teaches them to talk, and enriches their speech with epigrams, anecdotes and illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an unfailing source of delight to millions, happily not too critical. Why, out of all the books taken down from the shelves of the public libraries, four-fifths are novels, and of all those that are bought nine- tenths are novels. Compared with this tremendous engine of popular influence, what are all the other Arts put together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we not alter the old maxim, and say with truth, Let him who pleases make the laws if I may write the novels?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the field with which this Art of Fiction occupies itself, it is, if you please, nothing less than the whole of Humanity. The novelist studies men and women; he is concerned with their actions and their thoughts, their errors and their follies, their greatness and their meanness; the countless forms of beauty and constantly varying moods to be seen among them; the forces which act upon them; the passions, prejudices, hopes and fears which pull them this way and that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has to do, above all, and before all, with men and women. No one, for instance, among novelists, can be called a landscape painter, or a painter of sea-pieces, or a painter of fruit and flowers, save only in strict subordination to the group of characters with whom he is dealing. Landscape, sea, sky, and air, are merely accessories introduced in order to set off and bring into greater prominence the figures on the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first rule in Fiction is that the human interest must absolutely absorb everything else. Some writers never permit anything at all in their pages which shall divert our thoughts one moment from the actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When, for instance, Charles Reade — Alas! that we must say the late Charles Reade, for he is dead — when this great Master of Fiction, in his incomparable tale of the &quot; Cloister and the Hearth,&quot; sends Gerard and Denis the Burgundian on that journey through France, it is with the fewest possible of words that he suggests the sights and persons met with on the way ; yet, so great is thewhere lurk the routiers and the robbers, the cut-throat inn, the merchants, peasants, beggars, soldiers who go riding by; the writer does not pause in his story to tell us of all this, but yet we feel it — by the mere action of the piece and the dialogue we are compelled to see the scenery: the life of the fifteenth century passes before us, with hardly a word to picture it, because it is always kept in the background, so as not to interfere with the central figure of the young clerk journeying to Home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human interest in Fiction, then, must come before aught else. It is of this world, wholly of this world. It might seem at first as if the limitation of this Art to things human placed it on a lower level than the Arts of Painting and Music. That, however, is not so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stupendous subjects which were undertaken by the old Italian painters are, it is true, beyond the power of Fiction to attempt. It may be questioned whether they are not also, according to modern ideas, beyond the legitimate scope of painting. Certainly, just as there is nothing in the whole of creation more worthy of being studied and painted than the human face and form, so there is nothing more worthy of representation than men and women in action and in passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ancient poet placed the gods themselves upon the stage with the Furies and the Fates. Thenwe had the saints, confessors, and martyrs. We next descended to kings and great lords; in our times painter, poet, and novelist alike are contented with plain humanity, whether crowned or in rags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What picture, let us ask, what picture ever painted of angels and blessed souls, even if they are mounting the hill on which stands the Four Square City of the jasper wall, is able to command our interest and sympathy more profoundly than the simple and faithful story, truly and faithfully told, of a lover and his mistress?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, therefore, the especial characteristic of this Art, that, since it deals exclusively with men and women, it not only requires of its followers, but also creates in readers, that sentiment which is destined to be a most mighty engine in deepening and widening the civilization of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call it &lt;em&gt;Sympathy&lt;/em&gt;, but it means a great deal more than was formerly understood by the word. It means, in fact, what Professor Seeley once called the Enthusiasm of Humanity, and it first appeared, I think, about a hundred and fifty years ago, when the modern novel came into existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will find it, for instance, conspicuous for its absence in Defoe. The modern Sympathy includes not only the power to pity the sufferings of others, but also that of understanding their very souls; it is the reverence for man, the respect for his personality, the recognition of his individuality, and the enormous value of the one man, the perception of one man's relation to another, hisduties and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the strength of this newly-born faculty, and aided by the guidance of a great artist, we are enabled to discern the real indestructible man beneath the rags and filth of a common castaway, and the possibilities of the meanest gutter-child that steals in the streets for its daily bread. Surely that is a wonderful Art which endows the people — all the people — with this power of vision and of feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Painting has not done it, and could never do it; Painting has done more for nature than for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sculpture could not do it, because it deals with situation and form rather than action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music cannot do it, because Music (if I understand rightly) appeals especially to the individual concerning himself and his own aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poetry alone is the rival of Fiction, and in this respect it takes a lower place, not because Poetry fails to teach and interpret, but because Fiction is, and must always be, more popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this Art teaches, like the others, by suppression and reticence. Out of the great procession of Humanity, the &lt;em&gt;Comédie Surname&lt;/em&gt; which the novelist sees passing ever before his eyes, single figures detach themselves one after the other, to be questioned, examined, and received or rejected. This process goes on perpetually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanity is so vast a field that to one who goes about watching men and women, and does not sit at home and evolve figures out of inner consciousness, there is not, and can never be, any end or limit to the freshness and interest ofthese figures. It is the work of the artist to select the figures, to suppress, to copy, to group, and to work up the incidents which each one offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The daily life of the world is not dramatic — it is monotonous; the novelist makes it dramatic by his silences, his suppressions, and his exaggerations. No one, for example, in fiction behaves quite in the same way as in real life; as on the stage, if an actor unfolds and reads a letter, the simple action is done with an exaggeration of gesture which calls attention to the thing and to its importance; so in romance, while nothing should be allowed which does not carry on the story, so everything as it occurs must be accentuated and yet deprived of needless accessory details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gestures of the characters at an important juncture, their looks, their voices, may all be noted if they help to impress the situation. Even the weather, the wind and the rain, with some writers, have been made to emphasize a mood or a passion of a heroine. To know how to use these aids artistically is to the novelist exactly what to the actor is the right presentation of a letter, the handing of a chair, even the removal of a glove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-third-characteristic-of-fiction&quot;&gt;The Third Characteristic of Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third characteristic of Fiction, which should alone be sufficient to give it a place among the noblest forms of Art, is that, like Poetry, Painting, and Music, it becomes a vehicle, not only for the best thoughts of the writer, but also for those of the reader, so that a novelist may write truthfully and faithfully, but simply, and yet be understood in afar fuller and nobler sense than was present to his own mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This power is the very highest gift of the poet. He has a vision and sees a thing clearly, yet perhaps afar off; another who reads him is enabled to get the same vision, to see the same thing, yet closer and more distinctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a lower intellect thus to lead and instruct a higher is surely a very great gift, and granted only to the highest forms of Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this it is which Fiction of the best kind does for its readers. It is, however, only another way of saying that Truth in Fiction produces effects similar to those produced by Truth in every other Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, then, I have showed that this Art of Fiction is the most ancient of all Arts and the most popular; that its field is the whole of humanity; that it creates and develops that sympathy which is a kind of second sight; that, like all other Arts, its function is to select, to suppress, and to arrange; that it suggests as well as narrates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More might be said — a great deal more — but enough has been said to show that in these, the leading characteristics of any Art, Fiction is on exactly the same level as her sisters. Let me only add that in this Art, as in the others, there is, and will be always, whatever has been done already, something new to discover, something new to express, something new to describe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surgeons dissect the body, and account for every bone and every nerve, so that the body of one man, considered as a collection of bones and nerves,is so far exactly like the body of another man. But the mind of man cannot be so exhausted: it yields discoveries to every patient student; it is absolutely inexhaustible; it is to every one a fresh and virgin field; and the most successful investigator leaves regions and tracts for his successor as vast as those he has himself gone over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, after all, the greatest Psychologist is not the metaphysician, but the novelist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-laws-general-rules-and-principles-governing-the-art-of-fiction&quot;&gt;The Laws, General Rules, and Principles Governing the Art of Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We come next to speak of the Laws which govern this Art. I mean those general rules and principles which must necessarily be acquired by every writer of Fiction before he can even hope for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules will not make a man a novelist, any more than a knowledge of grammar makes a man know a language, or a knowledge of musical science makes a man able to play an instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the Rules must be learned. And, in speaking of them, one is compelled, so close is the connection between the sister Arts, to use not only the same terms, but also to adopt the same rules, as those laid down by painters for their students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these Laws appear self-evident, it is a proof that the general principles of the Art are well understood. Considering, however, the vast quantity of bad, inartistic work which is every week laid before the public, one is inclined to think that a statement of these principles may not be without usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, and before everything else, there is the Rule that everything in Fiction which is invented and is not the result of personal experience and observation is worthless. In some other Arts, the design may follow any lines which the designer pleases: it may be fanciful, unreal, or grotesque; but in modem Fiction, whose sole end, aim, and purpose is to portray humanity and human character, the design must be in accordance with the customs and general practice of living men and women under any proposed set of circumstances and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is to say, the characters must be real, and such as might be met with in actual life, or, at least, the natural developments of such people as any of us might meet; their actions must be natural and consistent; the conditions of place, of manners, and of thought must be drawn from personal observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take an extreme case: a young lady brought up in a quiet country village should avoid descriptions of garrison life; a writer whose friends and personal experiences belong to what we call the lower middle class should carefully avoid introducing his characters into Society; a South-countryman would hesitate before attempting to reproduce the North-country accent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very simple Rule, but one to which there should be no exception — never to go beyond your own experience. * &lt;small style=&quot;background-color:#FFFFE6;color:#242424&quot;&gt;[See NOTE]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;u&gt;NOTE:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been objected to this Rule that, if followed, it would entirely shut out the historical novel. Not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interest of the historical novel, as of any other novel, depends upon the experience and knowledge which the writer has of humanity, men and women being pretty much alike in all ages. It is not the setting that we regard, so much as thethat most of the people who read novels, and know nothing about the art of writing them, recognize before any other quality that of fidelity; the greatness of a novelist they measure chiefly by the knowledge of the world displayed in his pages; the highest praise they can bestow upon him is that he has drawn the story to the life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is exactly the same with a picture. If you go to the Academy any day, and listen to the comments of the crowd,acting of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting in an historical novel is very often absurd, incorrect, and incongruous; but the human interest, the skill and knowledge of character shown by the writer, may make us forget the errors of the setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, &amp;quot;Romola&amp;quot; is undoubtedly a great novel, not because it contains a true, and therefore valuable, reproduction of Florentine life in the time of the early Renaissance, for it does not; nor because it gives us the ideas of the age, for it does not; the characters, especially that of the heroine, being fully of nineteenth century ideas: but it is great as a study of character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in the &amp;quot;Cloister and the Hearth,&amp;quot; we do really have a description of the time and its ideas, taken bodily, sometimes almost literally, from the pages of the man who most truly represents them — Erasmus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that here is a rule for the historical novelist — when he must describe, he must borrow. If it be objected, again, that he may do the same thing with contemporary life, I reply that be may, if he please, but he will most assuredly be found out through some blunder, omission, or confusion caused by ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt the same blunders are perpetrated by the historical novelist; but these are not so readily found out except by an archaeologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, one who desires to reproduce a time gone by would not go to the poets, the divines, the historians, so much as to the familiar literature, the letters, comedies, tales, essayists, and newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- end div.sidenote --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that most of the people who read novels, and know nothing about the art of writing them, recognize before any other quality that of fidelity; the greatness of a novelist they measure chiefly by the knowledge of the world displayed in his pages; the highest praise they can bestow upon hi is that he has drawn the story to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is exactly the same with a picture. If you go to the Academy any day, and listen to the comments of the crowd, which is a very instructive thing to do, and one recommended to young novelists, you will presently become aware that the only thing they look for in a picture is the story which it tells, and therefore the fidelity with which it is presented on the canvas. Most of the other qualities of the picture, and of the novel as well, all that has to do with the technique, escape the general observer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-art-of-description&quot;&gt;The Art of Description&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This being so, the first thing which has to be acquired is the art of description. It seems easy to describe; any one, it seems, can set down what he sees. But consider. How much does he see? There is everywhere, even in a room, such a quantity of things to he seen: far, far more in field and hedge, in mountain and in forest and beside the stream, are there countless things to he seen; the unpractised eye sees nothing, or next to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a tree, here is a flower, there is sunshine lying on the hill. But to the observant and trained eye, the intelligent eye, there lies before him everywhere an inexhaustible and bewildering mass of things to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember how Mr. Jefferies sits down in a coppice with his eyes wide open to see what the rest of us never dreamed of looking for. Long before he has half-finished telling us what he has seen—behold! a volume, and one of the most delightful volumes conceivable. But, then, Mr. Jefferies is a profound naturalist. We cannot all describe after his manner; nor should we try, for the simple reason that descriptions of still life in anovel must be strictly subordinated to the human interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while Mr. Jefferies has his hedge and ditch and brook, we have our towns, our villages, and our assemblies of men and women. Among them we must not only observe, but we must select.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, then, are two distinct faculties which the intending novelist must acquire; viz., observation and selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the power of observation, it may be taught to any one by the simple method adopted by Robert Houdin, the French conjuror. This method consists of noting down continually and remembering all kinds of things remarked in the course of a journey, a walk, or the day's business. The learner must carry his note-book always with him, into the fields, to the theatre, into the streets — wherever he can watch man and his ways, or Nature and her ways. On his return home he should enter his notes in his commonplace-book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are places where the production of a notebook would be embarrassing — say, at a dinner party, or a street fight; yet the man who begins to observe will speedily be able to remember everything that he sees and hears until he can find an opportunity to note it down, so that nothing is lost. * &lt;small style=&quot;background-color:#FFFFE6;color:#242424&quot;&gt;[See NOTE]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;u&gt;NOTE:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I earnestly recommend those who desire to study this Art to begin by daily practice in the description of things, even common things, that they have observed, by reporting conversations, and by word portraits of their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will find that the practice gives them firmness of outline, quickness of observation, power of catching important details, and, as regards dialog, readiness to see what is unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preliminary practice and study of this kind will also lead to the saving of a vast quantity of valuable material, which is only wasted by being prematurely worked up into a novel written before the elements of the Art have been acquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The materials for the novelist, in short, are not in the books upon the shelves, but in the men and women he meets with everywhere; he will find them, where Dickens found them, in the crowded streets, in trains, tramcars and omnibuses, at the shop-windows, in churches and chapels; his materials are everywhere — there is nothing too low, nothing too high, nothing too base, nothing too noble, for the novelist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanity is like a kaleidoscope, which you may turn about and look into, but you will never get the same picture twice — it cannot be exhausted. But it may be objected, that the broad distinctive types have been long since all used. They have been used, but the comfort is that they can never be used up, and that they may be constantly used again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we ever be tired of them when a master hand takes one of them again and gives him new life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there to be no more hypocrites because we have already had Tartufe and Pecksniff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we suppose that the old miser, the young spendthrift, the gambler, the adventurer, the coquette, the drunkard, the soldier of fortune, are never to reappear, because they have been handled already?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long, on the contrary, as man shall continue story-telling, so long will these characters occur again and again, and look as fresh each time that they are treated by a master's hand as if they were newly discovered types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fidelity, therefore, can be only assured by acquiring the art of observation, which further assists in filling the mind with stored experience. I am quite sure that most men never see anything at all. I have known men who have even gone all round the world and seen nothing — no, nothing at all. Emerson says, very truly, that a traveller takes away nothing from a place except what he brought into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the observation of things around us is no part of the ordinary professional and commercial life; it has nothing at all to do with success and the making of money; so that we do not learn to observe. Yet it is very easy to shake people and make them open their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of us remember, for instance, the time when Kingsley astonished everybody with his descriptions of the wonders to be seen on the seashore and to be fished out of every pond in the field. Then all the world began to poke about the seaweed and to catch tritons and keep water-grubs in little tanks. It was only a fashion, and it presently died out; but it did people good, because it made them understand, perhaps for the first time, that there really is a good deal more to see than meets the casual eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present the lesson which we need is not that the world is full of the most strange and wonderful creatures, all eating each other perpetually, but that the world is full of the most wonderful men and women, not one of whom is mean orcommon, but to each his own personality is a great and awful thing, worthy of the most serious study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-power-of-selection-in-fiction&quot;&gt;The Power of Selection in Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, then, abundant materials waiting to be picked up by any who has the wit to see them lying at his feet and all around him. What is next required is the power of Selection. Can this be taught? I think not, at least I do not know how, unless it is by reading. In every Art, selection requires that kind of special fitness for the Art which is included in the much abused word Genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fiction the power of selection requires a large share of the dramatic sense. Those who already possess this faculty will not go wrong if they bear in mind the simple rule that nothing should be admitted which does not advance the story, illustrate the characters, bring into stronger relief the hidden forces which act upon them, their emotions, their passions, and their intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All descriptions which hinder instead of helping the action, all episodes of whatever kind, all conversation which does not either advance the story or illustrate the characters, ought to be rigidly suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closely connected with selection is dramatic presentation. Given a situation, it should be the first care of the writer to present it as dramatically, that is to say as forcibly, as possible. The grouping and setting of the picture, the due subordination of description to dialogue, the rapidity of the action, those things which naturally suggest themselves to the practised eye, deserve to be very carefully considered by the beginner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, a novel is like aplay: it may be divided into scenes and acts, tableaus and situations, separated by the end of the chapter instead of the drop-scene: the writer is the dramatist, stage-manager, scene-painter, actor, and carpenter, all in one; it is his single business to see that none of the scenes flag or fall flat: he must never for one moment forget to consider how the piece is looking from the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;character-in-fiction&quot;&gt;Character in Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next simple Rule is that the drawing of each figure must be clear in outline, and, even if only sketched, must be sketched without hesitation. This can only be done when the writer himself sees his figures clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters in fiction do not, it must be understood, spring Minerva-like from the brain. They grow; they grow sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly. From the first moment of conception, that is to say, from the first moment of their being seen and caught, they grow continuously and almost without mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they do not grow and become every day clearer, they had better be put aside at once, and forgotten as soon as may be, because that is a proof that the author does not understand the character he has himself endeavored to create. To have on one's hands a half-created being without the power of finishing him must be a truly dreadful thing. The only way out of it is to kill and bury him at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always thought, for instance, that the figure of Daniel Deronda, whose portrait, blurred and uncertain as it is, has been drawn with the most amazing care andwith endless touches and retouches, must have become at last to George Eliot a kind of awful veiled spectre, always in her brain, always seeming about to reveal his true features and his mind, but never doing it, so that to the end she never clearly perceived what manner of man he was, nor what was his real character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, what the author cannot set down, the reader cannot understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, how possible, how capable of development, how real becomes a true figure, truly understood by the creator, and truly depicted! Do we not know what they would say and think under all conceivable conditions? We can dress them as we will; we can place them in any circumstances of life: we can always trust them because they will never fail us, never disappoint us, never change, because we understand them so thoroughly. So well do we know them that they become our advisers, our guides, and our best friends, on whom we model ourselves, our thoughts, and our actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writer who has succeeded in drawing to the life, true, clear, distinct, so that all may understand, a single figure of a true man or woman, has added another exemplar or warning to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing, then, it must be insisted upon as of the greatest importance, should be begun in writing until the characters are so clear and distinct in the brain, so well known, that they will act their parts, bend their dialogue, and suit their action to whatever situations they may find themselves in, if only theyare becoming to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, clear outline drawing is best when it is accomplished in the fewest strokes, and the greater part of the figures in Fiction, wherein it differs from Painting, in which everything should be finished, require no more work upon them, in order to make them clear, than half- a-dozen bold, intelligible lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the methods of conveying a clear understanding of a character, they are many. The first and the easiest is to make it clear by reason of some mannerism or personal peculiarity, some trick of speech or of carriage. This is the worst, as may generally be said of the easiest way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another easy method is to describe your character at length. This also is a bad, because a tedious, method. If, however, you read a page or two of any good writer, you will discover that he first makes a character intelligible by a few words, and then allows him to reveal himself in action and dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, nothing is more inartistic than to be constantly calling attention in a dialogue to a gesture or a look, to laughter or to tears. The situation generally requires no such explanation: in some well-known scenes which I could quote, there is not a single word to emphasize or explain the attitude, manner, and look of the speakers, yet they are as intelligible as if they were written down and described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the highest art which carries the reader along and makes him see, without being told, the changing expressions, the gestures of the speakers,and hear the varying tones of their voices. It is as if one should close one's eyes at the theatre, and yet continue to see the actors on the stage as well as hear their voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only writer who can do this is he who makes his characters intelligible from the very outset, causes them first to stand before the reader in clear outline, and then with every additional line brings out the figure, fills up the face, and makes his creatures grow from the simple outline more and more to the perfect and rounded figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearness of drawing, which includes clearness of vision, also assists in producing directness of purpose. As soon as the actors in the story become real in the mind of the narrator, and not before, the story itself becomes real to him. More than this, he becomes straightway vehemently impelled to tell it, and he is moved to tell it in the best and most direct way, the most dramatic way, the most truthful way possible to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, in fact, only when the writer believes his own story, and knows it to be every word true, and feels that he has somehow learned from everyone concerned the secret history of his own part in it, that he can really begin to write it. * &lt;small style=&quot;background-color:#FFFFE6;color:#242424&quot;&gt;[See NOTE]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;u&gt;NOTE:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardly anything is more important than this — to believe in your own story. Therefore let the student remember that unless the characters exist and move about in his brain, all separate, distinct, living, and perpetually engaged in the action of the story, sometimes at one part of it, sometimes at another, and that in scenes and places which must be omitted in the writing, he has got no story to tell and had better give it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not think it is generally understood that there are thousands of scenes which belong to the story and never get outside the writer&amp;#39;s brain at all. Some of these may be very beautiful and touching; but there is not room for all, and the writer has to select.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know how sometimes, even from a practised hand, there comes a work marred with the fatal defect that the writer does not believe in his own story. When this is the case, one may generally find on investigation that one cause at least of the failure is that the characters, or some of them, are blurred and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the modern English novel, whatever form it takes, almost always starts with a conscious moral purpose. When it does not, so much are we accustomed to expect it, that one feels as if there has been a debasement of the Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, fortunately, not possible in this country for any man to defile and defame humanity and still be called an artist; the development of modern sympathy, the growing reverence for the individual, the ever-widening love of things beautiful and the appreciation of lives made beautiful by devotion and self-denial, the sense of personal responsibility among the English-speaking races, the deep-seated religion of our people, even in a time of doubt, are all forces which act strongly upon the artist as well as upon his readers, and lend to his work, whether he will or not, a moral purpose so clearly marked that it has become practically a law of English Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must acknowledge that this is a truly admirable thing,and a great cause for congratulation. At the same time, one may be permitted to think that the preaching novel is the least desirable of any, and to be unfeignedly rejoiced that the old religious novel, written in the interests of High Church or Low Church or any other Church, has gone out of fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;fidelity-truth-and-harmony-observed-in-fiction&quot;&gt;Fidelity, Truth, and Harmony Observed in Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, just as in Painting and Sculpture, not only are fidelity, truth, and harmony to be observed in Fiction, but also beauty of workmanship. It is almost impossible to estimate too highly the value of careful workmanship, that is, of style. Everyone, without exception, of the great Masters in Fiction, has recognized this truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will hardly find a single page in any of them which is not carefully and even elaborately worked up. I think there is no point on which critics of novels should place greater importance than this, because it is one which young novelists are so very liable to ignore. There ought not to be in a novel, any more than in a poem, a single sentence carelessly worded, a single phrase which has not been considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider, if you please, any one of the great scenes in Fiction — how much of the effect is due to the style, the balanced sentences, the very words used by the narrator!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, however, is only one more point of similarity between Fiction and the sister Arts. There is, I know, the danger of attaching too much attention to style at the expense of situation, and so falling a prey to priggishness, fashions, and mannerisms of the day. It is certainly a danger; at the same time, it sometimes seems, when one reads the slipshod, careless English which is often thought good enough for story-telling, that it is almost impossible to overrate the value of style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is comfort in the thought that no reputation worth having can be made without attending to style, and that there is no style, however rugged, which cannot be made beautiful by attention and pains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;How many times,&quot; a writer once asked a girl who brought him her first effort for advice and criticism; &quot;how many times have you re-written this page?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She confessed that she had written it once for all, had never read it afterwards, and had not the least idea that there was such a thing as style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it not presumptuous in the highest degree to believe that what one has produced without pains, thought, or trouble will give any pleasure to the reader?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, every scene, however unimportant, should be completely and carefully finished. There should be no unfinished places, no sign anywhere of weariness or haste — in fact, no scamping. The writer must so love his work as to dwell tenderly on every age and be literally unable to send forth a single page of it without the finishing touches. We all of us remember that kind of novel in which every scene has the appearance of being hurried and scamped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-requirements-of-the-art-of-fiction&quot;&gt;The Requirements of the Art of Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up these few preliminary and generallaws. The Art of Fiction requires first of all the power of description, truth, and fidelity, observation, selection, clearness of conception and of outline, dramatic grouping, directness of purpose, a profound belief on the part of the story-teller in the reality of his story, and beauty of workmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, moreover, an Art which requires of those who follow it seriously that they must be unceasingly occupied in studying the ways of mankind, the social laws, the religions, philosophies, tendencies, thoughts, prejudices, superstitions of men and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They must consider as many of the forces which act upon classes and upon individuals as they can discover; they should be always trying to put themselves into the place of another; they must be as inquisitive and as watchful as a detective, as suspicious as a criminal lawyer, as eager for knowledge as a physicist, and withal fully possessed of that spirit to which nothing appears mean, nothing contemptible, nothing unworthy of study, which belongs to human nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I repeat that I submit some of these laws as perhaps self-evident. If that is so, many novels which are daily submitted to the reviewer are written in wilful neglect and disobedience of them. But they are not really self-evident; those who aspire to be artists in Fiction almost invariably begin without any understanding at all of these laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence the lamentable early failures, the waste of good material, and the low level of Art with which both thenovel-writer and the novel-reader are too often contented. I am certain that if these laws were better known and more generally studied, a very large proportion of the bad works of which our critics complain would not be produced at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am in great hopes that one effect of the establishment of the newly founded Society of Authors will be to keep young writers of fiction from rushing too hastily into print, to help them to the right understanding of their Art and its principles, and to guide them into true practice of their principles while they are still young, their imaginations strong, and their personal experiences as yet not wasted in foolish failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-most-important-point-of-the-art-of-fiction--the-story&quot;&gt;The Most Important Point of the Art of Fiction – The Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all these preliminary studies there comes the most important point of all — the story. There is a school which pretends that there is no need for a story: all the stories, they say, have been told already; there is no more room for invention: nobody wants any longer to listen to a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hears this kind of talk with the same wonder which one feels when a new monstrous fashion changes the beautiful figure of woman into something grotesque and unnatural. Men say these things gravely to each other, especially men who have no story to tell: other men listen gravely; in the same way women put on the newest and most preposterous fashions gravely, and look upon each other without either laughing or hiding their faces for shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, indeed, if we think of it, a most strange and wonderful theory, that we should continue to care for Fiction and cease to care for the story. We have all along been training ourselves how to tell the story, and here is this new school which steps in, like the needy knife-grinder, to explain that there is no story left at all to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why, the story is everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot conceive of a world going on at all without stories, and those strong ones, with incident in them, and merriment and pathos, laughter and tears, and the excitement of wondering what will happen next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, these new theorists contradict themselves, because they find it impossible to write a novel which shall not contain a story, although it may be but a puny bantling. Fiction without adventure — a drama without a plot — a novel without surprises — the thing is as impossible as life without uncertainty. * &lt;small style=&quot;background-color:#FFFFE6;color:#242424&quot;&gt;[See NOTE]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;u&gt;NOTE:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A correspondent asks me if I do not like the work of Mr. Howells. Of course one cannot choose but like his writing. But one cannot also avoid comparing his work with that of his countryman, Nathaniel Hawthorne, who added to the charm of style the interest of a romantic and exciting story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the story, then. And here theory and teaching can go no farther. For every Art there is the corresponding science which may be taught. We have been speaking of the corresponding science. But the Art itself can neither be taught nor communicated. If the thing is in a man he will bring it out somehow, well or badly, quickly or slowly. If it is not, he can never learn it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here,then, let us suppose that we have to do with the mail to whom the invention of stories is part of his nature. We will also suppose that he has mastered the laws of his Art, and is now anxious to apply them. To such a man one can only recommend that he should with the greatest care and attention analyze and examine the construction of certain works, which are acknowledged to be of the first rank in fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among them, not to speak of Scott, he might pay especial attention, from the constructive point of view, to the truly admirable shorter stories of Charles Reade, to George Eliot's &quot;Silas Marner,&quot; the most perfect of English novels, Hawthorne's &quot;Scarlet Letter,&quot; Holmes's &quot;Elsie Venner,&quot; Blackmore's &quot;Lorna Doone,&quot; or Black's &quot;Daughter of Heth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He must not sit down to read them &quot;for the story,&quot; as uncritical people say; he must read them slowly and carefully, perhaps backwards, so as to discover for himself how the author built up the novel, and from what original germ or conception it sprang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me take another novel by another writer to illustrate my meaning. It is James Payn's &quot;Confidential Agent,&quot; a work showing, if I may be permitted to say so, constructive power of the very highest order. You have all, without doubt, read that story. As you know, it turns upon a diamond robbery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the unpractised hand it would seem as if stories of theft had already been told ad nauseam. The man of experience knows better: he knows that in his hands every story becomes new,because he can place it upon his stage with new incidents, new conditions, and new actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, Payn connects his diamonds with three or four quite ordinary families: he does not search for strange and eccentric characters, but uses the folk he sees around him, plain middle-class people, to whom most of us belong. He does not try to show these people cleverer, better cultured, or in any respect at all other than they really are, except that some of them talk a little better than in real life they would be likely to do. That is to say, in dialogue he exercises the art of selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presently, in this quiet household of age and youth, love and happiness, there happens a dreadful thing: the young husband vanishes amid circumstances which give rise to the most horrible suspicions. How this event acts upon the minds of the household and their friends; how the faith, sorely tried, of one breaks down, and that of another remains steadfast; how the truth is gradually disclosed, and the innocence of the suspected man is made clear — all this should be carefully examined by the student as a lesson in construction and machinery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He will not, one hopes, neglect the other lesson taught him by this novel, which is the art of telling the story, selecting the actors, and skilfully using the plain and simple materials which lie around us everywhere ready to our hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am quite sure that the chief lesson to be learned from the study of nearly all our own modern novelists is that adventure, pathos,amusement, and interest, are far better sought among lives which seem dull, and among people who seem at first beyond the reach of romance, than from eccentricity and peculiarity of manner, or from violent and extreme reverses and accidents of fortune. This is, indeed, only another aspect of the increased value which we have learned to attach to individual life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing more the Art student has to learn. Let him not only believe his own story before he begins to tell it, but let him remember that in story-telling, as in almsgiving, a cheerful countenance works wonders, and a hearty manner greatly helps the teller and pleases the listener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would not have the novelist make continual efforts at being comic; but let him not tell his story with eyes full of sadness, a face of woe and a shaking voice. His story may be tragic, but continued gloom is a mistake in Art, even for a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If his story is a comedy, all the more reason to tell it cheerfully and brightly. Lastly, let him tell it without apparent effort: without trying to show his cleverness, his wit, his powers of epigram, and his learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet let him pour without stint or measure into his work all that he knows, all that he has seen, all that he has observed, and all that he has remembered; all that there is of nobility, sympathy, and enthusiasm in himself. Let him spare nothing, but lavish all that he has, in the full confidence that the wells will not be dried up, and that the springs of fancy andimagination will flow again, even though he seem to have exhausted himself in this one effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, therefore, we may leave the student of this Art &lt;sup&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;#appendix&quot;&gt;See Appendix&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;. It remains for him to show whether he does wisely in following it farther. Of one thing for his encouragement he may rest assured; in the Art of Fiction more than in any other it is easy to gain recognition, far easier than in any of the sister Arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the English school of painting, for example, there are already so many good men in the field that it is most difficult to win an acknowledged position ; in the drama it is next to impossible to get a play produced, in spite of our thirty London theatres; in poetry it seems almost hopeless to get a hearing, even if one has reached the second rank; hut in Fiction the whole of the English-speaking race are always eager to welcome a newcomer; good work is instantly recognized, and the only danger is that the universal cry for more may lead to hasty and immature production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not mean that ready recognition will immediately bring with it a great pecuniary success. Unfortunately, there has grown up of late a bad fashion of measuring success too much by the money it seems to command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not always, remember, the voice of the people which elects the best man, and though in most cases it follows that a successful novelist commands a large sale of his works, it may happen that the Art of a great writer is of such a kind that it may never become widelypopular. There have been among us two or three such writers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One case will immediately occur to most of us here. It is that of a man whose books are filled with wisdom, experience, and epigram; whose characters are most admirably studied from the life, whose plots are ingenious, situations fresh, and dialogues extraordinarily clever. Yet he has never been widely popular, and, I am sure, never will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One may be pretty certain that this writer's money-value in the market is considerably less than that of many another whose genius is not half so great, but his popularity twice as large. So that a failure to hit the popular taste does not always imply failure in Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, then, is one to know, when people do not ask for his work, if he has really failed or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think he must know without being told if he has failed to please. If a man sings a song he can tell in a moment, even before he has finished, if he has pleased his audience. So, if a man writes a novel, he can tell by the criticisms in the journals, by reading between the lines of what his friends tell him, by the expression of their eyes, by his own inner consciousness, if he has succeeded or failed. And if the latter, let him find out as quickly as may be through what causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unlucky dramatist can complain that his piece was badly mounted and badly acted. The novelist cannot, because he is sure not to be badly read. Therefore, if a novelist fail at first, let him be well assured that it is his own fault; and if, on his second attempt, he cannot amend, let himfor the future be silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is more and more astonished at seeing the repeated efforts of writers whose friends should make them understand that they have not the least chance of success unless they unlearn all that they have learned and begin again upon entirely different methods and some knowledge of the science. It must be a cruel blow, after all the work that goes to make even a bad novel, after all the trouble of getting it published, to see it drop unnoticed, stillborn, though hardly worthy to receive words of contempt. If the disappointment leads to examination and self-amendment, it may prove the greatest blessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he who fails twice probably deserves to fail, because he has learned nothing, and is incapable of learning anything, from the lessons of his first failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-present-condition-of-the-art-of-fiction-in-england&quot;&gt;The Present Condition of the Art of Fiction in England&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me say one word upon the present condition of this most delightful Art in England. Remember that great Masters in every Art are rare. Perhaps one or two appear in a century; we ought not to expect more. It may even happen that those modern writers of our own whom we have agreed to call great Masters will have to take lower rank among posterity, who will have great Masters of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am inclined, however, to think that a few of the nineteenth-century novelists will never be suffered to die, though they may be remembered principally for one book — that Thackeray will be remembered for his &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; Dickens for &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; George Meredith for the&quot;Ordeal of Richard Feverel,&quot; George Eliot for &quot;Silas Marner,&quot; Charles Reade for the &quot;Cloister and the Hearth,&quot; and Blackmore for his &quot;Lorna Doone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, without thinking or troubling ourselves at all about the verdict of posterity, which matters nothing to us compared with the verdict of our contemporaries, let us acknowledge that it is a bad year indeed when we have not produced some good work, work of a very high kind, if not immortal work. An exhibition of the year's novels would generally show two or three, at least, of which the country may be, say, reasonably proud. Does the Royal Academy of Arts show every year more than two or three pictures — not immortal pictures, but pictures of which we may be reasonably proud?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would like, it is true, to see fewer bad novels published, as well as fewer bad pictures exhibited; the standard of the work which is on the borderland between success and failure should be higher. At the same time I am very sure and certain that there never has been a time when better works of Fiction have been produced, both by men and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Art is not declining, but is advancing, which is cultivated on true and not on false or conventional principles. Ought we not to be full of hope for the future, when such women as Mrs. Oliphant and Mrs. Thackeray Ritchie write for us — when such men as Meredith, Blackmore, Black, Payn, Wilkie Collins, and Hardy are still at their best, and such men at Louis Stevenson, Christie Murray,Clark Russell, and Herman Merivale have just begun?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the fiction, and, indeed, all the imaginary work of the future will he far fuller in human interest than in the past; the old stories — no doubt they will still be the old stories — will be fitted to actors who up till recently were only used for the purposes of contrast; the drama of life which formerly was assigned to kings and princes will be played by figures taken as much from the great struggling, unknown masses. Kings and great lords are chiefly picturesque and interesting on account of their beautiful costumes, and a traditional belief in their power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costume is certainly not a strong point in the lower ranks, but I think we shall not miss that, and wherever we go for our material, whether to the higher or the lower ranks, we may be sure of finding everywhere love, sacrifice, and devotion for virtues, with selfishness, cunning, and treachery for vices. Out of these, with their endless combinations and changes, that novelist must be poor indeed who cannot make a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I said at the outset that I would ask you to accord to novelists the recognition of their place as artists. But after what has been said, I feel that to urge this further would be only a repetition of what has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, though not all who write novels can reach the first, or even the second, rank, wherever you find good and faithful work, with truth, sympathy, and clearness of purpose, I pray you to give the author of that work thepraise as to an Artist — an Artist like the rest — the praise that you so readily accord to the earnest student of any other Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the great Masters of the Art — Fielding, Scott, Dickens, Thackeray, Victor Hugo — I, for one, feel irritated when the critics begin to appraise, compare, and to estimate them. There is nothing, I think, that we can give them but admiration that is unspeakable, and gratitude that is silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This silence proves more eloquently than any words how great, how beautiful an Art is that of Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;appendix&quot;&gt;Appendix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been asked not to leave the young novelist at this point. Let me, therefore, venture upon a few words of advice. I do this without apology, because, like most men who write, I receive, every week, letters from young beginners asking for counsel and guidance. To all these I recommend the consideration of the rules I have laid down, and, above all, attention to truth, reality, and style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was once asked to read a manuscript novel written by a young lady. The work was hurried, scamped, unreal — in fact, it had every fault. Yet there was something in it which made me think that there was hope for her. I therefore wrote to her, pointing out the faults, without sparing her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added that, if she was not discouraged, but would begin again, and would prepare carefully the scenario of a novel, fitted with characters duly thought out, I would give her such further advice as was in my power. The very next day she sent me five scenarios. I have not heard from her since, and I hope she has renounced the Art whose very elements she could not understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me suppose, then, that the writer has got his novel completed. Here begins the &quot; trouble,&quot; as the Americans say. And at this point my advicce may be of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that all publishers are eager to get good work: they are prepared to consider manuscripts carefully — most of them pay men, on whose judgment they rely, men of literary standing, to read and &quot;taste&quot; for them; therefore it is a simple and obvious piece of advice that the writer should send his work to some good publisher, and it is perfectly certain that if the work is good it will be accepted and published. There is, as I have said in the lecture, little or no risk, even with an unknown author, over a really good novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, then, the first work almost always contains immaturities and errors which prevent it from being really good. More often than not, it is on the border line, not so good as to make its publication desirable by a firm which will only issue good work, or by any means safe to pay its expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What then? I would advise the author never, from any considerations of vanity or self-confidence, to pay money to a publisher for bringing out his book. There are certain publishing houses, not the best, which bring out yearly quantities of novels, nearly every one of which is paid for by the author, because they are not good enough to pay their own expenses. Do not, I would say, swell the ranks of those who give the enemy reason to blaspheme this Art. Refuse absolutely to publish on such ignominious terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that to be asked for money to pay for the expense of publication is to be told that your work is not good enough to be published. If you have tried the half-dozen best publishers, and been refused by all, realize that the work will not do. Then, if you can, get the advice of some experienced man of letters upon it, and ponder over his judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cannot, reconsider the whole story from the beginning, with special reference to the rules which are here laid down. If necessary, rewrite the whole. Or, if necessary, put the whole into the fire, and, without being disheartened, begin again with another and a better story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not aim at producing an absolutely new plot. You cannot do it. But persevere, if you feel that the root of the matter is in you, till your work is accepted; and never, never, NEVER pay for publishing a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me end with a little piece of personal history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good many years ago, there was a young man of four or five and twenty, who ardently desired before all things to become a novelist. He spent a couple of years, giving to the work all his unemployed hours, over a novel of modern life. He took immense pains with it, rewrote some of the scenes half a dozen times, and spared neither labor nor thought to make it as good as he could make it. When he really felt that he could do nothing more with it, he rolled it up and sent it to a friend with the request that he would place it anonymously in Mr. Macmillan's hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Macmillan had it carefully read, and sent the author, still through the friend, his reader's opinion. The reader did not sign his opinion, but he was a Cambridge man, a critic of judgment, a man of taste, a kindly man, and he had once been, if he was not still, a mathematician. These things were clearly evident from his handwriting, as well as from the wording of his verdict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was to the effect that the novel should not be published, for certain reasons which he proceeded to give. But he laid down his objections with very great consideration for the writer, indicating for his encouragement what he considered points of promise, suggesting certain practical rules of construction which had been violated, and showing where ignorance of the Art and inexperience of life had caused faults such as to make it most undesirable for the author, as well as impossible for a publisher of standing, to produce the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writer, after the first pangs of disappointment, plucked up heart and began to ponder over the lessons contained in that opinion. The young man has since become a novelist, &quot;of a sort,&quot; and he takes this opportunity of returning his most sincere thanks to Mr. Macmillan for his kindness in considering and refusing to publish an immature novel, and to his anonymous critic for his invaluable letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would that all publishers' readers were like unto that reader, as conscientious and as kindly, and as anxious to save beginners from putting forth bad work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles Dickens, in a note now lying before me, alluding to an examination I once made of the mechanism of &quot;Barnaby Rudge,&quot; says — &quot;By the way, are you aware that Godwin wrote his 'Caleb Williams' backwards? He first involved his hero in a web of difficulties, forming the second volume, and then, for the first, cast about him for some mode of accounting for what had been done.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot think this the precise mode of procedure on the part of Godwin — and indeed what he himself acknowledges, is not altogether in accordance with Mr. Dickens' idea — but the author of &quot;Caleb Williams&quot; was too good an artist not to perceive the advantage derivable from at least a somewhat similar process. Nothing is more clear than that every plot, worth the name, must be elaborated to its denouement before anything be attempted with the pen. It is only with the denouement constantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of consequence, or causation, by making the incidents, and especially the tone at all points, tend to the development of the intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a radical error, I think, in the usual mode of constructing a story. Either history affords a thesis — or one is suggested by an incident of the day — or, at best, the author sets himself to work in the combination of striking events to form merely the basis of his narrative-designing, generally, to fill in with description, dialogue, or autorial comment, whatever crevices of fact, or action, may, from page to page, render themselves apparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer commencing with the consideration of an effect. Keeping originality always in view — for he is false to himself who ventures to dispense with so obvious and so easily attainable a source of interest — I say to myself, in the first place, &quot;Of the innumerable effects, or impressions, of which the heart, the intellect, or (more generally) the soul is susceptible, what one shall I, on the present occasion, select?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having chosen a novel, first, and secondly a vivid effect, I consider whether it can be best wrought by incident or tone — whether by ordinary incidents and peculiar tone, or the converse, or by peculiarity both of incident and tone — afterward looking about me (or rather within) for such combinations of event, or tone, as shall best aid me in the construction of the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be written by any author who would — that is to say, who could — detail, step by step, the processes by which any one of his compositions attained its ultimate point of completion. Why such a paper has never been given to the world, I am much at a loss to say — but, perhaps, the autorial vanity has had more to do with the omission than any one other cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most writers — poets in especial — prefer having it understood that they compose by a species of fine frenzy — an ecstatic intuition — and would positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes, at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thought — at the true purposes seized only at the last moment — at the innumerable glimpses of idea that arrived not at the maturity of full view — at the fully-matured fancies discarded in despair as unmanageable — at the cautious selections and rejections — at the painful erasures and interpolations — in a word, at the wheels and pinions — the tackle for scene-shifting — the step-ladders, and demon-traps — the cock's feathers, the red paint and the black patches, which, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, constitute the properties of the literary histrio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware, on the other hand, that the case is by no means common, in which an author is at all in condition to retrace the steps by which his conclusions have been attained. In general, suggestions, having arisen pell-mell are pursued and forgotten in a similar manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my own part, I have neither sympathy with the repugnance alluded to, nor, at any time, the least difficulty in recalling to mind the progressive steps of any of my compositions, and, since the interest of an analysis or reconstruction, such as I have considered a desideratum, is quite independent of any real or fancied interest in the thing analysed, it will not be regarded as a breach of decorum on my part to show the modus operandi by which some one of my own works was put together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I select 'The Raven' as most generally known. It is my design to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is referable either to accident or intuition — that the work proceeded step by step, to its completion, with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us dismiss, as irrelevant to the poem, per se, the circumstance — or say the necessity — which, in the first place, gave rise to the intention of composing a poem that should suit at once the popular and the critical taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-length-of-the-poem&quot;&gt;The Length of the Poem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We commence, then, with this intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial consideration was that of extent. If any literary work is too long to be read at one sitting, we must be content to dispense with the immensely important effect derivable from unity of impression — for, if two sittings be required, the affairs of the world interfere, and everything like totality is at once destroyed. But since, &lt;em&gt;ceteris paribus&lt;/em&gt;, no poet can afford to dispense with anything that may advance his design, it but remains to be seen whether there is, in extent, any advantage to counterbalance the loss of unity which attends it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I say no, at once. What we term a long poem is, in fact, merely a succession of brief ones — that is to say, of brief poetical effects. It is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such only inasmuch as it intensely excites, by elevating the soul; and all intense excitements are, through a psychal necessity, brief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, at least, one-half of the &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; is essentially prose — a succession of poetical excitements interspersed, inevitably, with corresponding depressions — the whole being deprived, through the extremeness of its length, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity of effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears evident, then, that there is a distinct limit, as regards length, to all works of literary art — the limit of a single sitting — and that, although in certain classes of prose composition, such as &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (demanding no unity), this limit may be advantageously overpassed, it can never properly be overpassed in a poem. Within this limit, the extent of a poem may be made to bear mathematical relation to its merit — in other words, to the excitement or elevation-again, in other words, to the degree of the true poetical effect which it is capable of inducing; for it is clear that the brevity must be in direct ratio of the intensity of the intended effect — this, with one proviso — that a certain degree of duration is absolutely requisite for the production of any effect at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holding in view these considerations, as well as that degree of excitement which I deemed not above the popular, while not below the critical taste, I reached at once what I conceived the proper length for my intended poem — a length of about one hundred lines. It is, in fact, a hundred and eight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-choice-of-an-impression-or-effect-to-be-conveyed&quot;&gt;The Choice of An Impression Or Effect To Be Conveyed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next thought concerned the choice of an impression, or effect, to be conveyed: and here I may as well observe that throughout the construction, I kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work universally appreciable. I should be carried too far out of my immediate topic were I to demonstrate a point upon which I have repeatedly insisted, and which, with the poetical, stands not in the slightest need of demonstration — the point, I mean, that Beauty is the sole legitimate province of the poem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few words, however, in elucidation of my real meaning, which some of my friends have evinced a disposition to misrepresent. That pleasure which is at once the most intense, the most elevating, and the most pure is, I believe, found in the contemplation of the beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When, indeed, men speak of Beauty, they mean, precisely, not a quality, as is supposed, but an effect — they refer, in short, just to that intense and pure elevation of soul — not of intellect, or of heart — upon which I have commented, and which is experienced in consequence of contemplating the &quot;beautiful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I designate Beauty as the province of the poem, merely because it is an obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring from direct causes — that objects should be attained through means best adapted for their attainment — no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation alluded to is most readily attained in the poem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the object Truth, or the satisfaction of the intellect, and the object Passion, or the excitement of the heart, are, although attainable to a certain extent in poetry, far more readily attainable in prose. Truth, in fact, demands a precision, and Passion, a homeliness (the truly passionate will comprehend me), which are absolutely antagonistic to that Beauty which, I maintain, is the excitement or pleasurable elevation of the soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It by no means follows, from anything here said, that passion, or even truth, may not be introduced, and even profitably introduced, into a poem for they may serve in elucidation, or aid the general effect, as do discords in music, by contrast — but the true artist will always contrive, first, to tone them into proper subservience to the predominant aim, and, secondly, to enveil them, as far as possible, in that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the essence of the poem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding, then, Beauty as my province, my next question referred to the tone of its highest manifestation — and all experience has shown that this tone is one of sadness. Beauty of whatever kind in its supreme development invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears. Melancholy is thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-refrain-a-sense-of-identity-in-repetition&quot;&gt;The Refrain: A Sense of Identity in Repetition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length, the province, and the tone, being thus determined, I betook myself to ordinary induction, with the view of obtaining some artistic piquancy which might serve me as a key-note in the construction of the poem — some pivot upon which the whole structure might turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In carefully thinking over all the usual artistic effects — or more properly points, in the theatrical sense — I did not fail to perceive immediately that no one had been so universally employed as that of the refrain. The universality of its employment sufficed to assure me of its intrinsic value, and spared me the necessity of submitting it to analysis. I considered it, however, with regard to its susceptibility of improvement, and soon saw it to be in a primitive condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As commonly used, the refrain, or burden, not only is limited to lyric verse, but depends for its impression upon the force of monotone — both in sound and thought. The pleasure is deduced solely from the sense of identity — of repetition. I resolved to diversify, and so heighten the effect, by adhering in general to the monotone of sound, while I continually varied that of thought: that is to say, I determined to produce continuously novel effects, by the variation of the application of the refrain — the refrain itself remaining for the most part, unvaried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These points being settled, I next bethought me of the nature of my refrain. Since its application was to be repeatedly varied it was clear that the refrain itself must be brief, for there would have been an insurmountable difficulty in frequent variations of application in any sentence of length. In proportion to the brevity of the sentence would, of course, be the facility of the variation. This led me at once to a single word as the best refrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question now arose as to the character of the word. Having made up my mind to a refrain, the division of the poem into stanzas was of course a corollary, the refrain forming the close to each stanza. That such a close, to have force, must be sonorous and susceptible of protracted emphasis, admitted no doubt, and these considerations inevitably led me to the long o as the most sonorous vowel in connection with r as the most producible consonant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sound of the refrain being thus determined, it became necessary to select a word embodying this sound, and at the same time in the fullest possible keeping with that melancholy which I had pre-determined as the tone of the poem. In such a search it would have been absolutely impossible to overlook the word &quot;Nevermore.&quot; In fact it was the very first which presented itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;a-search-for-a-reason-in-the-repetition-of-the-refrain&quot;&gt;A Search for A Reason in the Repetition of the Refrain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next desideratum was a pretext for the continuous use of the one word &quot;nevermore.&quot; In observing the difficulty which I had at once found in inventing a sufficiently plausible reason for its continuous repetition, I did not fail to perceive that this difficulty arose solely from the preassumption that the word was to be so continuously or monotonously spoken by a human being — I did not fail to perceive, in short, that the difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with the exercise of reason on the part of the creature repeating the word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, then, immediately arose the idea of a non-reasoning creature capable of speech, and very naturally, a parrot, in the first instance, suggested itself, but was superseded forthwith by a Raven as equally capable of speech, and infinitely more in keeping with the intended tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven, the bird of ill-omen, monotonously repeating the one word &quot;Nevermore&quot; at the conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length about one hundred lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, never losing sight of the object — supremeness or perfection at all points, I asked myself — &quot;Of all melancholy topics what, according to the universal understanding of mankind, is the most melancholy?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Death, was the obvious reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;And when,&quot; I said, &quot;is this most melancholy of topics most poetical?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I have already explained at some length the answer here also is obvious — &quot;When it most closely allies itself to Beauty: the death then of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had now to combine the two ideas of a lover lamenting his deceased mistress and a Raven continuously repeating the word &quot;Nevermore.&quot; I had to combine these, bearing in mind my design of varying at every turn the application of the word repeated, but the only intelligible mode of such combination is that of imagining the Raven employing the word in answer to the queries of the lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here it was that I saw at once the opportunity afforded for the effect on which I had been depending, that is to say, the effect of the variation of application. I saw that I could make the first query propounded by the lover — the first query to which the Raven should reply &quot;Nevermore&quot; — that I could make this first query a commonplace one, the second less so, the third still less, and so on, until at length the lover, startled from his original nonchalance by the melancholy character of the word itself, by its frequent repetition, and by a consideration of the ominous reputation of the fowl that uttered it, is at length excited to superstition, and wildly propounds queries of a far different character — queries whose solution he has passionately at heart — propounds them half in superstition and half in that species of despair which delights in self-torture — propounds them not altogether because he believes in the prophetic or demoniac character of the bird (which reason assures him is merely repeating a lesson learned by rote), but because he experiences a frenzied pleasure in so modelling his questions as to receive from the expected &quot;Nevermore&quot; the most delicious because the most intolerable of sorrows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perceiving the opportunity thus afforded me, or, more strictly, thus forced upon me in the progress of the construction, I first established in my mind the climax or concluding query — that query to which &quot;Nevermore&quot; should be in the last place an answer — that query in reply to which this word &quot;Nevermore&quot; should involve the utmost conceivable amount of sorrow and despair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;beginning-at-the-end&quot;&gt;Beginning At the End&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here then the poem may be said to have had its beginning — at the end where all works of art should begin — for it was here at this point of my preconsiderations that I first put pen to paper in the composition of the stanza:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Prophet!&quot; said I, &quot;thing of evil! prophet still if bird or devil!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By that Heaven that bends above us — by that God we both adore,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if, within the distant Aidenn,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quoth the Raven — &quot;Nevermore.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I composed this stanza, at this point, first that, by establishing the climax, I might the better vary and graduate, as regards seriousness and importance, the preceding queries of the lover, and secondly, that I might definitely settle the rhythm, the metre, and the length and general arrangement of the stanza, as well as graduate the stanzas which were to precede, so that none of them might surpass this in rhythmical effect. Had I been able in the subsequent composition to construct more vigorous stanzas I should without scruple have purposely enfeebled them so as not to interfere with the climacteric effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-first-objective---originality&quot;&gt;The First Objective - Originality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here I may as well say a few words of the versification. My first object (as usual) was originality. The extent to which this has been neglected in versification is one of the most unaccountable things in the world. Admitting that there is little possibility of variety in mere rhythm, it is still clear that the possible varieties of metre and stanza are absolutely infinite, and yet, for centuries, no man, in verse, has ever done, or ever seemed to think of doing, an original thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that originality (unless in minds of very unusual force) is by no means a matter, as some suppose, of impulse or intuition. In general, to be found, it must be elaborately sought, and although a positive merit of the highest class, demands in its attainment less of invention than negation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I pretend to no originality in either the rhythm or metre of the &quot;Raven.&quot; The former is trochaic — the latter is &lt;em&gt;octametre acatalectic&lt;/em&gt;, alternating with &lt;em&gt;heptametre catalectic&lt;/em&gt; repeated in the refrain of the fifth verse, and terminating with &lt;em&gt;tetrametre catalectic&lt;/em&gt;. Less pedantically the feet employed throughout (&lt;em&gt;trochees&lt;/em&gt;) consist of a long syllable followed by a short, the first line of the stanza consists of eight of these feet, the second of seven and a half (in effect two-thirds), the third of eight, the fourth of seven and a half, the fifth the same, the sixth three and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, each of these lines taken individually has been employed before, and what originality the &quot;Raven&quot; has, is in their combination into stanza; nothing even remotely approaching this has ever been attempted. The effect of this originality of combination is aided by other unusual and some altogether novel effects, arising from an extension of the application of the principles of rhyme and alliteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;locale-and-its-effect-upon-the-poetical-thesis&quot;&gt;Locale and its Effect Upon the Poetical Thesis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next point to be considered was the mode of bringing together the lover and the Raven — and the first branch of this consideration was the locale. For this the most natural suggestion might seem to be a forest, or the fields — but it has always appeared to me that a close circumscription of space is absolutely necessary to the effect of insulated incident — it has the force of a frame to a picture. It has an indisputable moral power in keeping concentrated the attention, and, of course, must not be confounded with mere unity of place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I determined, then, to place the lover in his chamber — in a chamber rendered sacred to him by memories of her who had frequented it. The room is represented as richly furnished — this in mere pursuance of the ideas I have already explained on the subject of Beauty, as the sole true poetical thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locale being thus determined, I had now to introduce the bird — and the thought of introducing him through the window was inevitable. The idea of making the lover suppose, in the first instance, that the flapping of the wings of the bird against the shutter, is a &quot;tapping&quot; at the door, originated in a wish to increase, by prolonging, the reader's curiosity, and in a desire to admit the incidental effect arising from the lover's throwing open the door, finding all dark, and thence adopting the half-fancy that it was the spirit of his mistress that knocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the night tempestuous, first to account for the Raven's seeking admission, and secondly, for the effect of contrast with the (physical) serenity within the chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the bird alight on the bust of Pallas, also for the effect of contrast between the marble and the plumage — it being understood that the bust was absolutely suggested by the bird — the bust of Pallas being chosen, first, as most in keeping with the scholarship of the lover, and secondly, for the sonorousness of the word, Pallas, itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-force-of-contrast&quot;&gt;The Force of Contrast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the middle of the poem, also, I have availed myself of the force of contrast, with a view of deepening the ultimate impression. For example, an air of the fantastic — approaching as nearly to the ludicrous as was admissible — is given to the Raven's entrance. He comes in &quot;with many a flirt and flutter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not the least obeisance made he — not a moment stopped or stayed he,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the two stanzas which follow, the design is more obviously carried out:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then this ebony bird, beguiling my sad fancy into smiling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,&quot; I said, &quot;art sure no craven,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Quoth the Raven — &quot;Nevermore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Though its answer little meaning — little relevancy bore;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With such name as &quot;Nevermore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect of the denouement being thus provided for, I immediately drop the fantastic for a tone of the most profound seriousness — this tone commencing in the stanza directly following the one last quoted, with the line,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this epoch the lover no longer jests — no longer sees anything even of the fantastic in the Raven's demeanour. He speaks of him as a &quot;grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore,&quot; and feels the &quot;fiery eyes&quot; burning into his &quot;bosom's core.&quot; This revolution of thought, or fancy, on the lover's part, is intended to induce a similar one on the part of the reader — to bring the mind into a proper frame for the denouement — which is now brought about as rapidly and as directly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the denouement proper — with the Raven's reply, &quot;Nevermore,&quot; to the lover's final demand if he shall meet his mistress in another world — the poem, in its obvious phase, that of a simple narrative, may be said to have its completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-limits-of-the-accountable&quot;&gt;The Limits of the Accountable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, everything is within the limits of the accountable — of the real. A raven, having learned by rote the single word &quot;Nevermore,&quot; and having escaped from the custody of its owner, is driven at midnight, through the violence of a storm, to seek admission at a window from which a light still gleams — the chamber-window of a student, occupied half in poring over a volume, half in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The casement being thrown open at the fluttering of the bird's wings, the bird itself perches on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the student, who amused by the incident and the oddity of the visitor's demeanour, demands of it, in jest and without looking for a reply, its name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The raven addressed, answers with its customary word, &quot;Nevermore&quot; — a word which finds immediate echo in the melancholy heart of the student, who, giving utterance aloud to certain thoughts suggested by the occasion, is again startled by the fowl's repetition of &quot;Nevermore.&quot; The student now guesses the state of the case, but is impelled, as I have before explained, by the human thirst for self-torture, and in part by superstition, to propound such queries to the bird as will bring him, the lover, the most of the luxury of sorrow, through the anticipated answer, &quot;Nevermore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the indulgence, to the extreme, of this self-torture, the narration, in what I have termed its first or obvious phase, has a natural termination, and so far there has been no overstepping of the limits of the real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in subjects so handled, however skillfully, or with however vivid an array of incident, there is always a certain hardness or nakedness which repels the artistical eye. Two things are invariably required — first, some amount of complexity, or more properly, adaptation; and, secondly, some amount of suggestiveness — some under-current, however indefinite, of meaning. It is this latter, in especial, which imparts to a work of art so much of that richness (to borrow from colloquy a forcible term), which we are too fond of confounding with the ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-excess-of-the-suggested-meaning&quot;&gt;The Excess of the Suggested Meaning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the excess of the suggested meaning — it is the rendering this the upper instead of the under-current of the theme — which turns into prose (and that of the very flattest kind), the so-called poetry of the so-called transcendentalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holding these opinions, I added the two concluding stanzas of the poem — their suggestiveness being thus made to pervade all the narrative which has preceded them. The under-current of meaning is rendered first apparent in the line-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Quoth the Raven &quot;Nevermore!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be observed that the words, &quot;from out my heart,&quot; involve the first metaphorical expression in the poem. They, with the answer, &quot;Nevermore,&quot; dispose the mind to seek a moral in all that has been previously narrated. The reader begins now to regard the Raven as emblematical — but it is not until the very last line of the very last stanza that the intention of making him emblematical of Mournful and never ending Remembrance is permitted distinctly to be seen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon that is dreaming,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shall be lifted — nevermore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-raven&quot;&gt;The Raven&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'Tis some visitor,&quot; I muttered, &quot;tapping at my chamber door—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Only this and nothing more.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nameless here for evermore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This it is and nothing more.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Sir,&quot; said I, &quot;or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That I scarce was sure I heard you&quot;—here I opened wide the door;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Darkness there and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, &quot;Lenore?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, &quot;Lenore!&quot;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Merely this and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Surely,&quot; said I, &quot;surely that is something at my window lattice;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;'Tis the wind and nothing more!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Perched, and sat, and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,&quot; I said, &quot;art sure no craven,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Quoth the Raven &quot;Nevermore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With such name as &quot;Nevermore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Till I scarcely more than muttered &quot;Other friends have flown before—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then the bird said &quot;Nevermore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Doubtless,&quot; said I, &quot;what it utters is its only stock and store&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of 'Never—nevermore'.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Meant in croaking &quot;Nevermore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;She shall press, ah, nevermore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Wretch,&quot; I cried, &quot;thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Quoth the Raven &quot;Nevermore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Prophet!&quot; said I, &quot;thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Quoth the Raven &quot;Nevermore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Prophet!&quot; said I, &quot;thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Quoth the Raven &quot;Nevermore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!&quot; I shrieked, upstarting—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Quoth the Raven &quot;Nevermore.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shall be lifted—nevermore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">There is a radical error, I think, in the usual mode of constructing a story. Either history affords a thesis or, at best, the author sets himself to work in the combination of striking events to form merely the basis of his narrative-designing, generally, to fill in with description, dialogue, or autorial comment, whatever crevices of fact, or action, may, from page to page, render themselves apparent.</summary>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt; table-of-contents --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is perhaps no superstition which has bad so mischievous an effect upon criticism as the modern habit of dismissing whole departments of art as intrinsically bad and unworthy. We constantly bear people stigmatize a play as &quot;a mere melodrama&quot; or &quot;a mere farce.&quot; They might as well call a poem &quot;a mere epic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our individual taste may lead us to prefer comedy to farce or melodrama, just as it may lead us to prefer ballades and rondeaux to epics. That Is a matter of private preference with which criticism Is not concerned. The function of criticism is to distinguish good from bad in any art, and to deny the possibility of a good melodrama is to destroy all criticism, including the right to condemn a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No form of artistic effort has suffered more from this indiscriminate condemnation than the type of narrative which we commonly call the Detective Story. That a very large number of people write bad detective stories is true; perhaps an even larger number write bad sonnets. But that does not prove that &quot;Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered Saints&quot; is not a great poem, neither does it prove that &quot;Le Crime d'Orcival&quot; Is not a great novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the average level of detective-story writing is peculiarly low, may not this fact itself be attributed to the refusal of literary criticism to take its artistic qualities seriously? Where there is no recognition of merit there can be no standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the workmanship of many even of the best contemporary writers of this class is often careless and hasty to an extent which would have shocked Poe and Gaboriau, who put into their tales of mystery as much care and artistic conscience as a modern writer would put into a &quot;problem&quot; novel, dealing with the delicate psychology of a man who thought he was made of glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detective or mystery story need not, of course, be primarily concerned with detectives. Some of the best stories of this type, like &lt;em&gt;The Woman in White&lt;/em&gt;, have not the shadow of a detective from cover to cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real distinguishing feature is that the reader should be confronted with a number of mysterious facts of which the explanation is reserved till the end. Now this reservation of the final solution, in order to pique the reader's curiosity, excite his Ingenuity, and lead him on to an unexpected climax is a quite legitimate artistic effect. The only question to be asked about it in any particular instance Is whether it succeeds, whether the effect is really accomplished?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for Its success two primary qualifications are necessary — firstly, that the mystery should really be mysterious; secondly, that the explanation should really explain. These conditions may appear at first sight somewhat elementary. Yet I know few modern detective stories that do not violate one or other of them, while a great many persistently violate both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regard to the first condition, English writers who aspire to popularity are severely handicapped by the characteristic sentimentalism of their countrymen. The British public likes to have its vice and virtue clear-cut and unmistakable. It likes the hero to be consistently heroic, the villain to be well marked by his black moustache, his cigarette and his easy laugh. Now this Is all very well in melodrama, but it is fatal to the mystery story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There it is essential that the hero should look as much like a villain and the villain as much like a hero as is possible. They must be ready to change characters at any moment. But English readers do not like to have their sympathies switched on and off in this manner. And English writers have to stultify their art in order to please them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When, in one of the Sherlock Holmes tales, a beautiful and appealing girl begs Holmes, whatever the evidence may be, not to believe in her lover's guilt, we know with absolute certainty that her lover is innocent. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would not dare to make him guilty after that appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Gaboriau would have dared. He would have made the beautiful and appealing girl guilty too, if it had suited his purpose. The French public is, I suppose, much less sentimental and much more discriminatingly critical than the British. The great French masters of the police novel never hesitate to make the noble and generous young man a murderer, or the heroic and long-suffering wife an adulteress and accomplice of assassins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second condition is even more constantly violated. I have read hundreds of such tales which made excellent reading so long as the mystery subsisted, but of which the conclusion was unspeakably weak and farfetched and in some cases absolutely unintelligible. Nothing is more irritant in a detective story than that even one mysterious circumstance should remain at the end unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the writers appear to imagine that it is quite sufficient if they have thought of some sort of explanation of the central mystery, while a hundred attendant facts, introduced solely to puzzle or mislead the reader, are left without even a suggestion to illumine them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the conclusion ought to be not merely plausible, but in a sense inevitable. The reader ought not indeed to expect It, but he ought to feel afterwards that he ought to have expected it. To explain the problem at the last moment, as is often done, by introducing new circumstances at which he could not possibly have guessed, is merely to leave him laboring under a half-conscious sense of injury and resentment, and rightly so, for he has been cheated into attempting to solve a puzzle which, as it turns out, was for him quite insoluble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal detective story all the clues to the true solution ought to be there from the first, but so overlaid as to pass unnoticed. If any one wishes to see how this can be done, let him read attentively the first two or three chapters of &lt;em&gt;The Moonstone&lt;/em&gt;, wherein, for example, the all-important conversation between Franklyn Blake and the doctor is given at length, but in such a context as to appear a mere incident designed to throw light on a phase of Franklyn's temperament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the worst and commonest temptation of the writer of detective stories is to the spendthrift use of coincidence. Let me take a very bad example from one of Mr. Arthur Morrison's stories. It is the story of a negro who throws a tortoise at a French servant and kills it. The Frenchman, who is much devoted to the tortoise, is bitterly angry and vows vengeance. The next day the negro is found murdered with an inscription pinned on him, &quot;&lt;em&gt;Revanche pour la Tortue&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It eventually turns out that the reference is not to the slaughtered tortoise, but to the massacre of La Tortue, an island off Haiti in which the negro had borne a part. Now this is quite intolerable. If it were a dog or a cat we might just pass it, but a tortoise! It is not common for men to be devoted to tortoises, and the coincidence of a man being so devoted to a tortoise as to swear vengeance for its death, and of the man who killed it being a man who had incurred the anger of people in an obscure island called the Tortoise is too much for any reader to swallow with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that it is sometimes urged in extenuation of such fictions that very remarkable coincidences do occur from time to time in real life. This is true enough, but it is nothing to the purpose. The old proverb that truth is stranger than fiction may be put more soundly in the form that fiction must not be so strange as truth. And this is obviously so, since fiction has to create an illusion of reality, while truth, being true, can be as improbable as it chooses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all the technical craft of mystery making Gaboriau stands first and almost without rival. He excels especially in avoiding all the errors of which I have spoken. His mysteries are really mysteries; his solutions are really solutions. He is baffling, but he is never unnatural. He leaves nothing unexplained. He never stretches the long arm of coincidence. Suspicion shifts naturally from culprit to culprit as it would in real life. Sometimes, as in &quot;La Veuve Lerouge,&quot; a single unnoticed circumstance will turn the whole story upside down. But the circumstance is not in itself unnatural or even startling. We feel rather foolish not to have thought of it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilkie Collins was inferior to Gaboriau in the special technique of the detective story. But he had immense compensation in his superiority in the larger art of creation. The characterization of Gaboriau, though by no means as wooden as some of his English imitators, is comparatively faint and pallid. Collins, on the other hand, could, when he chose, create great comedic figures worthy to rank with those of Dickens. There is no Count Fosco, no Captain Wragge, no Miss Clack in Gaboriau. Nor is Lecoq so picturesque a figure as Sergeant Cuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that this kind of interest is generally thought to be unnecessary, if not absolutely out of place in a detective story. No mistake could be more disastrous; it is responsible for more than half of the appalling dullness of modern mystery novels. Unless you are interested in the characters in a story you cannot be interested in what happens to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fosco is arresting before he has done or suffered anything, and therefore any mystery in which Fosco is involved makes one hold one's breath. But the ordinary hero of sensational fiction is so signally uninteresting in himself that one really cannot pretend to be excited as to whether he is or is not guilty of the death of his equally uninteresting uncle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe had perhaps less ingenuity than Gaboriau, and certainly less power of creative characterization than Collins. Moreover, his output was small and his fiction like his poetry is all splendid fragments — reminders of what he might have done but for the curse of Reuben that lay always upon him. But he was what neither Gaboriau nor Collins could claim to be, a poet and a man of abstract thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a conception as that of &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot; is imaginatively beyond the reach of any other writer of the kind. And Dupln is more than a great detective, he is a great rationalistic philosopher, the incarnation of the logical and scientific conception of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A criticism of modern detective fiction would obviously be inadequate without some appreciation of the great Sherlock Holmes cycle. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is at least entitled to claim the honor of being the only novelist since Dickens, one of whose creations has become a popular proverb. It is easy to test this. Mr. Rudyard Kipling is generally considered a popular writer. Mulvaney is probably Mr. Kipling's most popular creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let anyone say in an assembly of twenty average men chosen at random from the street — &quot;That man Is quite a Mulvaney.&quot; Perhaps two men will understand the reference; perhaps one; quite possibly none. But let him say &quot;That man is quite a Sherlock Holmes.&quot; The recognition will be instantaneous and unanimous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man who had not heard of Holmes would be more singular than a man who could not sign his own name. Sir Arthur is the only writer of our time who has done this, and he has never done it twice. He has done more ambitious work than the Sherlock Holmes tales, but none of it has passed into the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they fully deserved their popularity. They were excellent stories, admirably conceived, and in the great majority of cases admirably executed. But their charm was not wholly or even mainly the charm of the pure detective story. One or two, like &quot;Silver Blaize,&quot; for instance, were admirable even from the technical point of view, but for the most part — well, you have only to compare them with Gaboriau to feel the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that Sherlock Holmes was too perfect a detective for the stories of which he is the hero to be perfect detective stories. The conception of the ideal reasoner, the man in whom the powers of observation and deduction had become so acute that he saw instantly the remote causes and the remote consequences of every fact, was a fine one. Poe had conceived it before, but Sir Arthur amplified and popularized it, making the drawing and coloring broader and leaving out the philosophy. The whole figure of Holmes is intensely picturesque, his violin, his cockaigne, his fits of lethargy and energy, his egotism, his contempt for passion. And through it all ran a subcurrent of irony mirrored in the admirable fatuity of Watson, which made the flavor more delicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this idealization of the detective is in a way fatal to the art of the detective story. That the true solution may be absolutely hidden from the reader it is necessary that it should be only slowly and partially revealed to the detective. Holmes sees everything in a moment, and so leads us to see too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is where Gaboriau's hero has the advantage of him. In one of his conversations with Watson, Holmes is, I remember, very severe on Lecoq, whom he pronounces &quot;a bungler.&quot; Certainly Lecoq had no pretence to the faultless insight of his critic. He was a clever and energetic detective, but no miracle worker. He made mistakes, he followed false scents, he led the reader astray. And so he made the story. In a word Lecoq was a bungler because Gaboriau was an expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to find the best contemporary mystery stories — the best I mean, considered simply as mystery stories — we shall not go to the famous cycle of Sherlock Holmes. Still less shall we go to Mr. Arthur Morrison, whose experiments in this direction, with the one exception of &quot;The Dorrington Deed Box,&quot; are of little value, and whose real and quite unquestionable talents lie in a different direction, or to Mr. Fergus Hume, who wrote one good detective story, followed by a number of negligible ones. We shall, I think, turn to the work of two women, Mrs. A. K. Green and Miss Florence Warden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem curious that women should be successful in a branch of fiction which many would be disposed to pronounce a masculine specialty. Perhaps Mrs. Green has herself supplied the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of her best stories, &lt;em&gt;That Affair Next Door&lt;/em&gt; she introduces us to a very commonplace old maid, like most old maids curious, secretive, keenly observant of her neighbors' affairs, and fond of speculating about other people's business. Circumstances throw her into the very centre of a mysterious crime, and suddenly reveal in her all the qualities of a great detective. All the characteristics which made her a nuisance to her neighbors make her an invaluable ally to the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conception is a daring, and, I think, a true one. I fancy that the two faculties which the great Sherlock declared to be the prime necessities of a detective, observation and deduction, are feminine rather than masculine faculties. It will hardly be disputed that it is so in regard to the former; while, as to the latter, what man ever discovered as much about the inhabitants of the house opposite as any woman will deduce from the shape of their window blinds? Most women quite habitually indulge in the sort of ratiocination that Holmes practised over the old hat. Be that as it may, Mrs. A. K. Green herself has certainly as much right as any contemporary writer to claim the mantle of Gaboriau for stories the excellent technique of which should put some popular writers on this side of the Atlantic to shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miss Florence Warden is in many ways even more worthy of note, and would, I fancy, have her merits more generally acknowledged, if criticism did justice to the mystery story. Also, I think, she would do better work. Almost all her defects arise from a lack of artistic seriousness, due, it may be, to the knowledge that the sort of story she is writing will never have either its merits properly acknowledged or its faults properly criticized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She writes, I should say, too much. But, when all has been said, it remains true that her work has qualities strikingly absent from that of her rivals. For one thing she has grasped the fact to which I referred in speaking of Wilkie Collins, the fact that good character draughtsmanship is a necessary element in good sensationalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She interests you in her creations before she attempts to interest you in their adventures and perplexities. There are in her stories several figures that one remembers when the plot is forgotten. Moreover, she has a real sense of romance, a rare and a most essential gift. For romance is no easy thing to achieve, and has nothing whatever to do with sensational incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have a romance without any incident at all as in E. Nesbit's novel, &lt;em&gt;The Red House&lt;/em&gt;. Or you may have battle, murder and sudden death every ten lines without a spark of romance, as in the novels of Mr. Stanley Weyman. Miss Warden has got the real thing. The first chapter of &lt;em&gt;The Mystery of Dudley Horne&lt;/em&gt;, the first two or three chapters of &lt;em&gt;No. 3 The Square&lt;/em&gt; strike the note that gives the thrill. They are genuinely romantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a pity that Stevenson's &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; has been spoilt as a mystery story by passing into a proverb. I, like most persons, I suppose, of my generation, knew the explanation before I read the story. To those who have had the good fortune not to know it, it must be, I should imagine, an extraordinarily exciting mystery, as well as an admirable parable and a quite unrivalled piece of writing. That Stevenson could have written a very fine detective story, if he had chosen, no one who has read the tense and fascinating chapter in &lt;em&gt;The Wrecker&lt;/em&gt;, where Wares and the hero overhaul the derelict wreck, will be disposed to doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mention of &quot;Dr. Jekyll&quot; recalls the possibility of the philosophic detective story. The idea that you cannot put good philosophy into certain art-forms is as absurd and mischievous as the idea that you cannot put good workmanship into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Shaw, for example, has put his philosophy into the form of ordinary melodrama in &quot;The Devil's Disciple.&quot; Ibsen has put his into the form of pantomimic extravaganza in &quot;Peer Gynt.&quot; There Is no earthly reason why a man with a specific talent for the work should not put ideas as profound into the form of the detective story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For after all the essence of the detective story is the presence of visible phenomena with a hidden explanation. And that, when one comes to think of it, is the essence of all the philosophies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">The old proverb that truth is stranger than fiction may be put more soundly in the form that fiction must not be so strange as truth. And this is obviously so, since fiction has to create an illusion of reality, while truth, being true, can be as improbable as it chooses.</summary>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt; table-of-contents --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first written story, probably scratched on a tablet of smoothed bark or slate, must have been a record of an actual occurrence. Even if it merely reproduced in rough, almost illegible characters, the legend of past battles or of heroes hitherto commemorated only in ballad or in song, it was no less the fixing of a fact; and we can amuse ourselves by picturing the student with his tools, the centre of an admiring crowd, successful and happy in having constructed a visible, tangible memory — something that could be handled and carried about, circulated, scanned again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many centuries after this great event, this first meeting of the author in the pride of composition with the public eager to read his work, the &quot;book,&quot; if we may so term it, was concerned with the setting down of facts — hard, irrefutable, unimaginative facts. It told, for the benefit of others who were not present, what somebody did, and later on, doubtless, what somebody said. Not until other centuries had rolled round, we may suppose, did that lightning-flash of inspiration illumine some especially receptive mind whose owner suddenly, in a fine frenzy of invention, bethought himself of putting on record what somebody might, have done, or might have said. As yet, every book was a work of reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment which marked the possibility of describing things that could happen, or that might have happened, buried as it is now is in the irrecoverable deeps of time, marked also the onset of a wonder-working change that stretched down the ages, until, by a thousand tentacles, it entangles the life of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It implied the dawn of imagination, the beginning of the creative mystery by which a myriad differing visions are clothed with flesh and blood and given to the vital breath. The teller of stories began to perceive — very slowly, indeed, that within his own limited being lay a strange, unsuspected, unlimited power: that he possessed a magic crucible by which all things he observed, all things he heard, might not only be stored as memories, but might be transmuted, re-cast, projected and given forth in a marvellous semblance of life. Astonishing vistas were henceforward opened to his fascinated gaze, though stumbling indeed must have been his first bewildered steps in the effort to explore their endless, lonely labyrinths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, as from the crude, imitative daubs of the troglodytes rose the glorious realm of pictorial art, and as from the ancient poets and trouvères grew the stately palaces of literature, so, from these hesitating attempts to ensnare the bright gleams of imagination, the vast enterprises of the fiction of modern times may trace their lineal descent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is of permanent interest to endeavor to follow, even for a brief period, the results of this enormous development of human appreciations, to consider what is meant, and to glance at certain difficulties immediately evolved by its progress. And first, a pretty problem in psychology confronts the student, a problem as full of latent argument as the recurring assertions that the actor should, or should not, feel the emotions he portrays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is indeed rather of a kin with this favorite puzzle of debate, though, by leave of the dictators of the stage, we may set it upon a higher plane. If, for convenience of treatment, we momentarily narrow it down for illustration to a familiar example — that of Charlotte Brontë — it will not mean the revival of any unprofitable discussions or dissensions as to claims of authorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bare statement is this: a young woman, living quietly in a country parsonage, conveys into her novels far more than she has ever seen or heard or experienced, and conveys it so convincingly, so strongly, that few flaws can be found with the presentment and arrangement of her material Her one-sided correspondence with her Professor will not suffice to explain the mystery; how then shall we approach it, how comprehend it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Charlotte Brontë lived and wrote, the course of prose fiction is strewn with illustrations, not, perhaps, as striking, but certainly quite as curious. Characters in fiction may be roughly divided into two broad classes; those based on observation of a particular person, sometimes to such an extent that we can recognize them; and those based on general observation — imagined, yet bearing authentic attributes of human nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the former class belong Vernon Whitford in &lt;em&gt;The Egotist&lt;/em&gt;; Mr. Micawber; certain personages in recent novels of Mr. H. G. Wells; and, we believe, sweet Milly Theale in &lt;em&gt;The Wings of the Dove&lt;/em&gt;. To the latter class belong an immense number of characters, ranging from Sir Willoughby Patteme and Mr. Rochester to the Prince in &lt;em&gt;The Prisoner of Zenda&lt;/em&gt; and the heroes or heroines of innumerable unimportant stories of amorous or political intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is odd to recall the blunders some writers have made when attacking this problem. Trollope, rarely a sound critic (he was much too plodding and levelheaded to be that, for all critics should have reckless and splendid enthusiasms) when he was analysing Blanche Amory in &lt;em&gt;Pendennis&lt;/em&gt; came across this passage: &quot;For this young lady was not able to carry out any emotion to the full, but had a sham enthusiasm, a sham hatred, a sham love, a sham taste, a sham grief; each of which flared and shone very vehemently for an instant, but subsided, and gave place to the next sham emotion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was moved thereupon to write: &quot;Thackeray, when he drew this portrait, must certainly have had some special young lady in his view.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may or may not have been so; but nothing is less likely if we are to suppose this a rule. Thackeray was one of the creators; in the general flow of his mind he, in common with others, was able to imagine and to &quot;describe&quot; almost at will those who should best carry on his scheme. Incidentally, a few pages earlier in the book Trollope unconsciously assumes his proper aspect by stating didactically: &quot;The object of a novel should be to instruct in morals while it amuses.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would seem that in many cases the strenuous efforts made by certain modern writers to obtain &quot;local color&quot; are unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The description of the characters is well done,&quot; says the routine reviewer — as though he referred to a joint of beef; and perhaps the characters, speaking strictly, were not &quot;described &quot; at all, but were subjective, called into being by that ready inward vision, to be scrutinized and noted as fit themes by the brain, half producer, half critic. Introspection, at its most subtle stage of refinement, is here in full employment; but it is not precisely the faculty or process depicted by those whose business it is to study the intricacies of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Introspection,&quot; wrote a noted psychologist, &quot;is very often the direct inspection and perception of experience, whereby its different elements and their aspects are classified, tabulated and compared. When we have to deal with complex experiences or trains of experiences, we must often reconstruct them gradually in repeated trials by memory, and if we fancy our memories may deceive us, try to register their simplest or most distinct effects, and by the study of these ensure a better and fuller remembrance and description of them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, however, will not help us at all to comprehend the inward vision of the creative artist; so far from finding that elements of his experience &quot;classified, tabulated and compared,&quot; he has often to make his experiences for himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is perfectly true, of course, that we cannot imagine anything of which we have previously had no knowledge. We can picture a flying cow, but we are familiar with cows and with wings; we can see with the mind's eye distant rivers and mountains and icy wastes as described by explorers, but we are familiar with their component parts; We cannot conceive, try how we will, an animal lacking head and body and tail; nothing so extraordinary has ever come within our range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the strenuous ingenuity of Swift could merely exaggerate humanity in the Brobdingnagians, diminish it in the Lilliputians, and distort it in the Houyhnhnms. From the persons and places and objects which we have seen and read of, from the conversations we have heard, it is possible, however, to construct any number of combinations and elaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a basis of fact, the imaginative artist builds a structure so firm and shapely and imposing and sometimes so beautiful that he wins from the world the final, incontrovertible title of creator, even though we know quite well that what we behold is but his dreaming made manifest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mediocre novelist, entertaining though he may be, and skilful at his task by using the impalpable, diffused &quot;material&quot; accumulated by his busy brain, never reaches this stage. His characters may have individuality, may be recognizable and well differentiated, but they fail to move us. Individuality and personality are two very different attributes: the one is the mechanical working model, the other the living, breathing man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustrations may easily be drawn from the books of acknowledged masters, Trollope, for instance, was a master of the art of mere storytelling, but his people are organisms of a low degree of vitality. Their movements interest us exceedingly, but they never become as intimate friends or arouse a definite enmity; we meet them with pleasure, we leave them without a sigh. Even Mary Thorne, perhaps the most attractive woman he has given us, losses her value the moment the tale closes with her marriage to Frank Gresham — we feel that she has accomplished her life's work, has held out bravely until the last knot of a clever tangle has been unravelled, but that the impact of her personality has been very trifling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To examine, by way of contrast, the work of a master such as George Meredith is to realize a difference that is startling. Despite the almost metallic brilliance of the conversation in such a book as &lt;em&gt;One of Our Conquerors&lt;/em&gt; — a brilliance which has at times even a disruptive tendency — we are forced to feel the problem of Victor and Nataly; we are smirched with the lost honor; the crash of the terrible final collapse rings in our ears; and, though we prefer to regard Meredith as artist rather than moralist, the message thunders at us from the ruins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a triumph of personality in fiction. The creative mystery is no less vivid in the work of Mr. Thomas Hardy. Who can fail to visualise Tess as a suffering human being? We set the story aside to think of her and her troubles; the grim pursuit of fate reacts upon the reader; the creation of the novelist's brain has achieved the garb of flesh, has walked and talked with us. And in one respect Mr. Hardy has the advantage of Meredith: his minor characters, almost without exception, are as convincing as his heroes and his heroines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we take another example, from the work of Mr. Henry James, we are on more delicate ground; he has his select circle, and it increases but slowly. Few would venture to deny his paramount creative power, his projection of a score of living fictional personalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning back to Charles Dickens, we find the line of demarcation between individuality and personality difficult to draw; in so many cases Dickens invented some easy, exaggerated peculiarity for his characters and let it stand as a label of sure identification — a mean way of shuffling out of the true creative task. Certain of his chief characters — Uriah Heep, for example — simply &quot;give away&quot; the trick — albeit the trick of a superb craftsman. Yet we are bound to concede that creation went hand in hand with observation in so amusing a couple as the Wellers, and that in some instances, such as the Cheeryble brothers, Captain Cuttle, Mr. Pecksniff, Mary Tapley, and others that will be brought to mind by a moment's reflection, Dickens succeeded in reaching a more purely creative plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is, then, the creative mystery exhibited so freely by so many exponents, explicable as a matter of practice or perseverance? The men whom we have considered were men of the active world, competent and shrewd; Charlotte Bronte, compared with them, was a secluded flower in a country garden. Wherein lies the secret?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a satisfactory reply to this question we should clear from our minds the notion that travel and wide experience of the world are necessary elements in the composition of the creative force; we must contemplate the point briefly in the light of pure psychology. Tremendous adventures of the soul may take place in an armchair by the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The man's true life,&quot; said Robert Louis Stevenson in an inspired passage, &quot;for which he consents to live, may lie altogether in the fields of fancy. The clergyman in his spare hours may be winning battles, the fanner sailing ships, the banker reaping triumphs in the arts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if, as a modern poet-philosopher has put it, &quot;all that happens to us is divinely great, and we are always in the centre of a great world,&quot; we may be certain that the creative impulse has abundance of material to labor upon when its subtle urgings begin, scanty though its field may seem to the superficial observer. Scorning the limitations of the body, the mind sets forth, exploring, hovering, selecting and rejecting, exulting in the perpetual variety of its vision and the perfection of its freedom. Placing its own conceptions within other imagined minds, it watches them develop and move independently, and thrills to find them suddenly endowed with separate life, working out their unearthly destinies, equipped with volition and a sphere of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can it, then, capture this wonder, snare it confidently in the net of words? — for without this entirely distinct and final process all far flights of creative fancy must be in vain. The artist, controlling, patient, persistent, compels himself to answer this question, which is ever before him. The sculptor, seeing the statue in the block of shapeless marble, may know inspiration and despair; but with quick, careful hand he chisels away the rough surface until the desired outline appears. So is it with the creative literary artist: sometimes eager, sometimes downcast, he strives to finish that last necessary labor by which alone his dream may be sent abroad to enchant his fellows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, just as miracles might be termed the language of heaven, whose transcendent alphabet we mortals are able to scan and puzzle out letter by letter, so the human creator feels that he is but piecing together faithfully the smallest sentences in a majestic language which as yet is not clearly apprehended. One who has spent a long life in the exposition of complex relationships and interactions assures us that he is compelled to realise that so far he has touched the merest outer fringe of his chosen subject; yet he has penetrated farther than most men into this mysterious region of wraiths, fantasies, echoes and undertones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is humbled, as we all are when a glimpse of the truth takes us by surprise, at the splendor of the vision and the incompetence of the interpreter; he feels that the greatest of us suffers a sense of artistic destitution — he sits, poised, hesitant and abashed, with pen in unready hand, before the presence of beauty that makes him ache to record its lightest reflections — to create, in an earthly medium, the fashion of spiritual things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astonishingly, indeed, have we travelled in our quest: We have seen that the creative artist may be the silent central point of a brilliant universe; that his experiences may be love-laden without love; convivial without companions; spacious and assured without wanderings in strange lands; agitated and impetuous without discordant voices; furious and wounded without the shock of battle; and that the secret thoughts of a man, his memories and fancies, incommunicable unless he pleases, compose, in the most profound and significant sense, his life itself, wherein as to friendly shelter he may withdraw, secure, unapproachable, supremely content, to give forth in due time the adventures of his soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt; table-of-contents --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as the world endures people will itch to hear a story; so there is but small fear the maker of tales will awake one morning to find that no one cares any longer to listen to him. But, unhappily, there is today a growing tendency to divorce literature from fiction, and there was more than a measure of truth in the rebuke I heard administered at a library by a stately and picturesque old lady to a greatly astonished assistant — &quot;I want something to read, and you have nothing here but novels.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old lady did not mean to imply that there is necessarily nothing to read in a novel; she is a sensible woman and knows her Balzac far too well to make any such mistake. But what she did mean was that among the crowds of new books in gaily colored bindings pushing and jostling each other on the library shelves, there was probably not one she herself would care to read and, after turning over the leaves of some twenty or more, I was fain to agree with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the fall of the leaf — and even as I write, autumn is upon us — comes what used to be known in good old-fashioned days, as the Book Season. Today, the term seems somewhat inadequate, for the Book Season has spread itself out until it practically covers the length of the year, stretching from January to December through the advertisement columns of the newspapers and adding greatly to the sorrows and labors of conscientious reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the great bulk of this enormous output is fiction — sad tales, merry tales, tales with a moral, tales without a moral, tales we have heard before and can hear again, tales that are worth telling and tales that are not. Of late the attention of many serious-minded people has been turned to this question of novel writing and novel reading. Sermons have been preached about certain novels (with the immediate result of greatly increasing the publishers' sales and the authors' reputations), while the custodians of Free Libraries are loudly deploring that the books most largely borrowed are works of contemporary fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am quite prepared to be told that a good deal of talent goes to the making of some of these novels, for every week critics are kindly patting authors on the back and scattering compliments with generous hands — &quot;a work of decided promise,&quot; &quot;exceptional talent,&quot; &quot;a touch of genius,&quot; etc. — indeed genius is a term so commonly used that it is only charitable to suppose it has taken unto itself a new meaning and is not the same word we have hitherto consecrated to the giants of the golden age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a certain sense, however, the critics are well within their rights, for today we judge literature by the standards of commerce. If a book can fetch a long price we argue (no doubt very sensibly) that it must possess some solid merit. It was in this spirit that a lady audaciously dedicated her novel &quot;To the General Public, the only critic whose opinion is finally worth having,&quot; and the audacity was, in this instance, fully justified by success. What an author earns is seemingly of more interest to the greater number of his readers than what he writes — the man who can make money is, they are convinced, possessed of genius as distinct from talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern novelist is essentially a man of affairs. With admirable discretion he determines to study the public taste rather than observe the higher canons of art, and the public are not as a rule, ungrateful. Anyone could easily give more than a dozen names of writers of popular fiction whose yearly incomes must surely be sources of absorbing interest to the keen-eyed vultures of Somerset House, and whose prosperity has been largely responsible for the birth of that new and lucrative profession, the literary agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books are written today with the avowed object of making money, and, say the authors, it is only the voice of envy that can possibly find fault with their well-deserved success. People will not read a novel merely for its style or literary excellence; they wish to be amused and not instructed; they do not want the author's view of life, but their own commonplace ideas cleverly presented to them as in a mirror, and the older writers with their keen insight into the heart of things, their long kindly moralizings between the acts, their slow-moving pageant to the music of laughter and tears, can hardly hope to hold their own against the latest popular success: as a well-known author once said to me with an engaging air of candor &quot;after all, you know, it is not the best books that sell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has sometimes been a matter of curiosity to me what becomes of all these greatly praised novels that are now flooding the market. Do they bring in handsome but unsuspected profits to their creators, or do they only &quot;fret their brief hour upon the stage&quot; to find their way at last to that Gehenna of writers, the shop of the remainder-man?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have often wondered that some author, panting after realism, has not made a better use of the remainder-man, for he would serve as a handy villain, cheapening books (as is his habit) until he finally brings them down to the lowest depth of degradation and they are sold, by weight as waste paper. But he has not, I believe, as yet found a place in the fiction gallery of well-known characters where a new dress for an old friend would often prove very attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I myself &quot;read&quot; for a publishing firm of high repute, and I was then more often struck with the imitative faculty of the writers than with their originality. So many books bore a more than strong resemblance to each other, while how many plots have I not found to be boldly taken (without acknowledgment) from the French!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I especially remember one clever scene that held me by its force and power, and yet was hauntingly reminiscent of something I had read before, like some old tune to which I could not, for the moment, give a name. Re-reading my favorite Balzac that night as a mental rest-cure after the labors of the day, I came across the scene, to my relief as well as my disgust, word for word and character for character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This I admit was an exceptionally bad case, but similar instances are to be found, and even reviewers have been sometimes caught napping. Some of the books that passed through my hands were of a wholly different character. Well written and replete with pretty fancies they only needed a known name to help them to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the fiction-loving public has but little fancy for such delicate miniature painting. It greatly prefers the bold outlines of the scene painter or the garish colors of the poster, so it was clearly impossible to risk failure by offering goods for sale for which there would be but little or no demand: I could only be grateful to the authors for the loan of their manuscripts. Sometimes one of these same books eventually found a publisher, and I would watch its fate with almost paternal interest, but I cannot recall a single instance where one of them was fortunate enough to find a public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had occasion a few months ago to ask for a novel at a well-managed lending library. The author is a man of some distinction, who (though he is not one of those successful writers who sell their books by the quarter-million) can claim readers to the extent of some odd thousands. The novel I wanted is one of bis best, and I was a little surprised when the manager told me he would try to get it for me, but as it was an old book I might have to wait a little time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;An old book!&quot; I said, &quot;why it only came out the other day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manager corrected me; the book must have been out at least a twelve-month, and then in answer to my indignant &quot;Well, what of that?&quot; leaned over the counter in friendly fashion to give me a true history of the life of a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was growing dusk, the shop for a wonder was empty, and the gaslight shone on the backs of some thousand or more brightly-bound volumes that crowded the shelves and were plied high upon the counter — some with the name of a customer written on a narrow strip of paper that hung from between their leaves like the tongue from a thirsty dog's mouth, others as yet unclaimed. A sense of depression came over me as he poured out the wisdom of his past and vast experience for my future guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A year,&quot; he said, &quot;is the length of a book's life — of a novel, I mean. If it sells at all, it sells at once, for people will not read old books however good the books may be. They only care for the new ones, and it does not seem to matter what they are, if only they are new. For my own part I would far rather read some of the old ones — a dozen years ago or more, better books were brought out. But you cannot get people so much as to look at them, for they judge all books by the dates on the title-page, and so. as I said before, by the end of a twelvemonth the average book is practically dead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked round at the bookshelves, filled (if this intelligent young man is to be believed) with the Doomed, and behind each volume I seemed to see the pale anxious face of the author listening dejectedly to the discouraging story. I named two literary artists — &quot;Their books still sell, though they are at least a dozen years old, and yet they can hardly be described as popular authors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He admitted that their books still sold, but explained that these writers are now classics. &quot;They have never had what you may call a big sale, but they always go on selling. And there is nothing today between a classic and a popular success. A book has simply no chance at all unless it is well pushed by the publisher and the newspapers, and even then it may not go. The truth is there are far too many of them, and if there should happen to be a good one among them by a new writer, as often as not it gets swamped among the rubbish, and some one or other helps himself to the best of it for his own book. The publishers are partly to blame — they flood the market with indifferent stuff, and then are surprised they cannot get rid of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He spoke with authority and with the air of one who politely declines further argument on a subject of which he is a past master; so I left the shop and went out into the mild darkness of a late February afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was he right, this intelligent young man who so ably represented the purely commercial side of literature, and beside whose experience my own was but as of a dilettante amateur? I could at least conscientiously say that the publishing house with which I had once been connected had never &quot;flooded the market with indifferent stuff,&quot; but remembering those over-crowded bookshelves, I was not wholly prepared to give the statement the lie direct. In the old times (to which some of us look back with regret) a publisher's motto was &quot;Few but fit,&quot; a motto then easy enough to follow. For there were giants in those days-long books that came to stay; and to these we now turn as the standard of comparison by which we judge our writers of modern action. Possibly, in so doing we make a very great mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that faraway past, novels were mostly read by cultured persons with a taste for letters, and they were fortunate in finding writers who could give them what is perhaps best described as literary fiction. But even in matters of art, demand will create supply, and the times have changed. Today every one reads, and so, almost unconsciously, popular writers have learned to be content to measure their wit, not by the monuments of classic eloquence but by the intellect of their readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A noted novelist is said to have stated that his only ambition was to &quot;reach the great heart of the people.&quot; Now to reach the great heart of the people it is before all things necessary to learn the language of the people, and in England the speech of our mixed population is neither picturesque nor poetical. If any one feels inclined to dispute the truth of this statement, let him mingle for an hour or so with a middle-class holiday crowd, or study the romances that find the greatest favor in the workroom or the kitchen, for this is the public that has to be considered — and seriously considered too — by the writer who proposes to make his fortune out of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once asked a country traveller to tell me who were the largest buyers of certain popular novels, and the surprising answer came: &quot;Well, publicans buy them for their wives.&quot; Nor do I believe the statement to be incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This curious half-educated public has its own prejudices, its own opinions, its own code of morals, and is as widely divorced in sympathy from the intelligent workman who reads for self-improvement, as it is from the scholarly man of letters who frankly deplores the present condition of things. It is oddly sensitive on many points, has a fixed conviction that the author is poking fun at it if it does not understand all that he is saying, and hotly resents any quotation in a foreign language as possibly concealing some evil thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sentiment and plenty of it, above all religious sentimentality, never fails to make its appeal to the great heart of the people, and to lash the vices of the rich with a nine-thonged whip while glibly praising the virtues of the poor is an almost sure road to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an enormous mass of class prejudice among the people that takes the place of an elemental critical faculty, and all writers of fiction would do well to bear this in mind. For this strange, semi-merged, all-powerful and ever-increasing public, is, in the matter of books, wonderfully conservative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let an author once get firm hold of their affections and he is safe. The cold wind of neglect will never blow upon him, nor is there any fear of his audience melting away to join the crowds that may gather around a newer showman with more gaily painted puppets. If only their old favorite will still speak to them in the style that years ago made him their hero, so long will his faithful public give him their ears. They want no new thing, but are content with the same lovers, the same villains, the same adventures, and the same sentiments they have already known and approved, and new-comers, wandering by chance on to the old pitch, often find it very hard to get an honest hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the books to which my friend the librarian had referred as the popular successes, and popular successes they undoubtedly are, but to old-fashioned people nourished on old-fashioned literary prejudices they are apt to prove a trifle disconcerting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were the old standards wrong, or has fiction (as we knew it) become a dead art? Is the length of a book's life to be strictly limited to twelve short months, or is there still more reasonable hope left that it may live on to charm successions of readers in the years to come, instead of being flung on one side like an old glove as soon as the date on the title-page shows that it can be no longer described as a new novel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the librarian's tale be true, then who is to blame — the authors, the publishers, or the public? A writer in a weekly paper has boldly laid the whole of the burden upon the shoulders of the authors. They begin, he tells us, by doing their best, and a vast proportion of &quot;first books'' now published show some promise. Then the authors get into harness, adjust their collars, and write for bread and butter, throwing aside their early ideals as useless, unmarketable lumber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is never wise to argue with an expert; but though this may be true we cannot think it sufficiently accounts for the dearth of purely literary work put forward in the guise of fiction. The public (as the lady novelist boldly said) is the ultimate court of appeal, on the time-honored principle that the man who pays the fiddler calls the tune, and today the English public are calling for commonplace tunes. In the island of Saints better counsels prevail, and we have there welcomed the birth of a new school of literature, producing delicate work that has in it (or so we believe) the strength to live. But so far it has not sought expression in a novel. Still, there is every reason to hope that from Ireland may yet arise a mighty maker of tales who will give us a Gaelic Comédie Humaine and so revive, in all its copious leisurely splendor, the art of fiction. When at last this giant shall come in all the fulness of his strength he will surely not lack a multitude of hearers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been speaking lately on this very subject of modern fiction to a ripe critic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some of it is clever&quot; I suggested tentatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, far too clever&quot; was his answer. &quot;You want something more than mere cleverness if a book is to live.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that he was right. The art concealing the art is lost to us today, and talent is all too often blatantly self-assertive, and over-anxious to lead off the applause: the mere pretence of modesty is, for the moment, hopelessly out of fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;But after all, what does it matter to you,&quot; my critic went on after a brief pause, &quot;whether a novel lives one year or twenty? You do not propose to write a book, and all these authors, I do not doubt, can take very good care of themselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought of the rows of doomed volumes — consumptives awaiting the doctor's verdict — and this time I was: not so sure that he was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on one point he was most certainly wrong; for I have a very strong personal interest in this matter. Everyone before they die, says a wise old saw, should plant a tree, have a child, and write a book. I must plead guilty to having neglected the first and second of these old-fashioned duties, but I have accomplished the third and last — I have written a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the wearisome and manifold labors of the day I have found time — slowly and with infinite pains — to write a romance, but not even my best and closest friend has ever suspected me of such an indiscretion. Line by line, and page by page the book has grown, until it has become as a very part of myself; its making has been the loving work of years, and on the very day I paid that discouraging visit to the lending library I had written the last words of the last chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long ago I gave it a name — &quot;The Silent Feet of Mary&quot; — and when a recent novel bearing the title &quot;The Brown Eyes of Mary&quot; was published, I actually felt resentful, as though the author had wantonly infringed my private law of copyright. That I should change the title of my book was clearly impossible. Mary had lived so long with me, I had grown so well accustomed to her presence and &quot;the beat of her unseen feet,&quot; that to have christened her afresh would have seemed nothing short of sacrilege. Her silent feet had followed me so faithfully down busy streets and along lonely ways; had paused when I paused, hurried when I hurried, had been in truth as the noiseless echo of my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That the fiction-reading public would ever appreciate Mary I could have no reasonable hope. She had none of the qualities that make for success, for judged by the standard of contemporary criticism she was neither witty, amusing, nor audacious; her life had been passed among quiet ways and pleasant places, and she was not the heroine of any notorious adventures — who would care to follow the tread of her silent feet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A memory of the books I had urged the great publishing house to accept came back to me, and I knew only too well that they were none of them of kin to Mary. A dozen or more years ago she might have hoped to claim a few readers, but today she could look for nothing better than one short year of neglect on library shelves before she was finally sold as waste paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To such shame she should never come; so, after a long spell of indecision, on a dull sultry summer afternoon I slowly burned the manuscript page by page in an empty grate, until a smouldering heap of charred paper was all that was left to me of a most dear and constant companion. As the smoke filled the room half blinding and choking me in the hot heavy air, my old friend the critic walked in and asked me what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have been burning a book — a novel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is not a man of many words, but he took his pipe out of his mouth and spoke. All that he said, it might not be seemly to repeat, but the gist of the whole matter was that I had done a very wise thing — that it was a pity other writers did not offer up their first-born in a voluntary sacrifice — that fiction was in a parlous state, and it was highly improbable that I could have done anything to improve It.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;After all, the public are the real offenders.&quot; he ended, &quot;for it is they who are mainly responsible for the flood of fiction,&quot; and I think, Mr. Urban. that he spoke the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt; table-of-contents --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new terror has been added to the ways of crime, since every burglar carries a potential conviction at his finger-ends. At the Clerkenwell Sessions last week a man was convicted of housebreaking on no other evidence than that of the fingerprints which he had inadvertently left upon a pane of glass in the window through which he had made his forcible entry. Another of the fraternity who was captured about the same time was wearing a pair of thin kid-gloves by way of precaution against leaving such damnatory marks behind him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an eloquent testimony to the wholesome effect which the work of Dr. Francis Galton has had upon the work of criminal investigation. It may seem at first sight that the mere impression of a man's finger-tips affords but a slender basis on which to condemn him to hard labor. But as a matter of fact there can hardly be any more convincing evidence of his guilt or identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the physical characteristics by which we are guided in distinguishing between human individuals there are none more certain or more invariable than the tiny ridges and furrows which cover the skin of the hands, and which are most conspicuous, because least liable to flexion, on the tips of the fingers and thumbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notorious Beck case recently showed us how uncertain and misleading the ordinary methods of Identification may be. Detective-Inspector Collins mentioned at the trial last week that they have photographs at Scotland Yard of two men who are so much alike that the police can only tell the difference between them by their fingerprints. Yet these tiny and almost unnoticeable marks afford an unmistakable method of differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthropologists now universally agree with Dr. Galton. who first drew attention to the subject in this country some fifteen years ago, that the shapes of these tiny ridges and furrows are the best of all data by which a man or woman can be identified. Their great merit consists in the fundamental facts that they are never the same in two individuals, that they remain practically constant in the same person from the cradle to the grave, that they cannot be artificially modified, and that they can easily be classified for handy reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;They form patterns, considerable in size and of a curious variety of shape, whose boundaries can be firmly outlined, which are little worlds in themselves. They have the unique merit of retaining all their peculiarities unchanged through life, and afford in consequence an incomparably surer criterion of identity than any other bodily feature.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent though the Bertillon system of body-measurements is, it yields in certainty and simplicity to the fingerprint system, which is now used to supplement or supplant it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man may change in height and breadth, in complexion and the color of his hair. He may be an adept in facial disguise, like the late Charles Peace. He may even succeed in modifying or obliterating his skin-marks. But he can never alter the tell-tale writing on his finger-tips, which appears again practically unchanged even after the skin has been destroyed by fire or acids. A dead body beaten out of shape by the waves can be identified by the fingerprints; forgery and personation can be detected; even Jezebel, when the dogs had devoured all but the palms of her hands, could have been recognized by them if this system had been known to her people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peculiar usefulness of the fingerprint method of identification to the police is two-fold. In the first place it affords an unquestioned means of identifying the habitual criminal whose fingerprints have once been impressed on a piece of paper and tiled in the archives of a detective office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Scotland Yard there is now a well-organized fingerprint department, which already possesses the record of the finger-tips of a hundred thousand persons who have come under the notice of the police. An ingenious but simple method of classification, depending on the establishment of certain fundamental types under which all fingerprints may be placed, makes it possible to consult this great &quot;dictionary of the criminal classes&quot; with ease and rapidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus an arrested person can speedily be traced, if he is an old offender, and fingerprints left by a burglar or other criminal at once enable the police to identify him, if he has already come through their hands. Secondly, there can be no question of mistaken identity where the fingerprint is available for evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-drawn weariness of the Tichborne trial would have been dispelled in a single day If the real Tichborne had only left an impression of his fingerprints at home, and Mr. Beck's sufferings would have been impossible if the Fingerprint Department at Scotland Yard had existed when his double was first convicted. It is hardly possible to overrate the Importance of such a system to a civilized society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of fingerprints as identification marks, though it has only lately been introduced to our criminal jurisprudence by Dr. Galton's labors, seems to have been known to mankind from very early times. The British Museum contains an Assyrian brick on which the seller of a field impressed one of his fingers as a witness to his signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students of survivals in culture have suggested that one of our apparently meaningless legal formalities is a vague memory of some forgotten lore of this kind. In signing an important deed, the parties to it still place their fingers on a wafer and remark that they deliver it as their act and deed—like Mr. Witherden in the &lt;em&gt;Old Curiosity Shop&lt;/em&gt;. The original meaning of this ceremony has never been clearly explained. Probably it is merely a relic of the ancient belief that personal contact of some kind was necessary to make a deed valid: but it is also possible that it dates from the older practice of not merely touching the deed but leaving a fingerprint on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Such hand-prints,&quot; Dr. Galton tells us, &quot;have been made and repeated in many semi-civilized nations, and have even been impressed in vermilion on their state documents, as formerly by the sovereign of Japan.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meadows Taylor, in a paper on land tenure in China, gives a facsimile of a deed which Is authenticated by the fingerprint of the vendor, according to a common practice in that mysterious country. The engraver Bewick verified one of his books by the impression of his inky thumb, and an American geological surveyor, much plagued by Mexican forgers, hit upon the same method of signing the cheques which he had to pay out on behalf of the Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the first definite and regular use of the fingerprint as a preventive of forgery is due to Sir William Herschel. one of a distinguished scientific family, during his service in Bengal. About 1858 he was so much bothered by the wily Hindu that he began to use the signature of the inked finger, chiefly with the idea of frightening the man who made it from afterwards repudiating his formal act. He found that his adoption of the Indian tipsahi had far-reaching consequences. The fingerprint not only acted as a moral deterrent to the forger, it also afforded an unmistakable means of identifying signatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural idea of the Bengali is, as Mr. Kipling shows in &lt;em&gt;The Gate of a Hundred Sorrows&lt;/em&gt;, that a pension should be paid as long as there is any one to pass a forged receipt on the authorities, and it is almost impossible for a European to detect a forgery in the characterless native scripts. But when Sir William Herschel adopted the fingerprint as a sign-manual and forced all pensioners to authenticate their receipts in this way, he put a speedy end to the forgeries which had been a source of considerable loss to the Government of Bengal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His work lasted over a quarter of a century, in which time he fully satisfied himself that fingerprints could not be counterfeited and did not change perceptibly with the advancing years of their owner. Yet it required nearly half a century for this excellent and simple plan to commend itself to the Indian Government. In 1896, the postmaster of Bengal at last adopted this safeguard against the fraud so rife in his districts by compelling all who received payment of a post-office order to furnish an impression of their thumb, which effectually prevented the common trick of asserting that the wrong man had been paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last decade, the fingerprint has been generally recognized as the most perfect method of identification. But by no means all its possible usefulness has yet been exploited. The forgery of wills and other documents would be rendered almost hopeless if every citizen were compelled by law to supply a set of his fingerprints to be filed at Somerset House with the certificate of his birth, and if it were further enacted that all documents must be authenticated by fingerprints as well as signatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comparison of any disputed document with the official fingerprint would afford an immediate and satisfactory test of its genuineness since it seems to be impossible to forge a fingerprint satisfactorily, and it is as certain as anything can be that no two men resemble each other in the marks on all their fingers. Society's perpetual war against crime would surely be facilitated by the adoption of this reasonable and not impossibly cumbrous precaution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe is a more glorious, Hawthorne a more sympathetic study for the American critic. The former, at his best, is always cosmopolitan; the latter betrays on every page a perplexing, but certainly a thoroughly American personality. The genius of Poe wrought upon the current narrative of his time with the results recorded in the last chapter; this personality of Hawthorne exercised itself as powerfully upon the same material, the product belonging to that still scanty literature of which an American may say, &quot;Here is how some of us have felt and thought according to our own race and our own history.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short story familiar to the young Hawthorne was romantic narrative of the kind practised in the annuals, and it was in the school of the annuals that he began to write. Grimness, for example, appealed to him as to the rest of his generation. In one of his earliest stories, &lt;em&gt;Alice Doane's Appeal&lt;/em&gt;, the narrator professes to be pleased when the terror of the incidents sets the nerves of his audience trembling, nor does this fashion fail to be reflected in many later narratives. The mysterious, again, was his favorite province, albeit he trod there for his own purposes. The sentimental — here his somber spirit was too austere for the Zeitgeist, as Poe's was too intense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many a tale of Hawthorne's might have been as sentimental as the most sickly of &lt;em&gt;The Token or The Forget-me-not&lt;/em&gt;, if its author had not worked below the levels from which sentimentality bubbles. He began, in truth, as a worker in the hot-house gardens cultivated by Mrs. Shelley and Emma Roberts; but he soon transcended such narrow limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if we are seeking the spiritual kinsmen of Hawthorne, we must leave this English group of writers and look to the German romanticists. Tieck's mystic stories, &lt;em&gt;The Fair Haired Eckbert&lt;/em&gt; (1796), and &lt;em&gt;The__Runenberg&lt;/em&gt; (1802), are romances with a moral analysis behind them, and so, at least in this particular, resemble the later American stories. There is also a resemblance to Hawthorne in Hoffmann's &lt;em&gt;Sandmann&lt;/em&gt;, which depicts an unpleasant personality whose influence upon the weak hero symbolizes the feebleness of the latter's will; indeed, the idea of this story is paralleled in Hawthorne's early tale, &lt;em&gt;The Prophetic Pictures&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Der Sandmann&lt;/em&gt; was pubished in 1817, before Hawthorne's career had begun. Yet neither here, nor elsewhere, is there reason to suppose even so much dependence upon Germany as in the case of Poe. It is true that a rather typical selection of translations into English from the German romanticists was scattered in periodicals and in book form before 1830. It is true that Hawthorne might have been influenced by some of these narratives, or by the other literature which flowed from German romanticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But scholars who found possible sources for his tales in German, have been referred to undoubted sources in &lt;em&gt;The American Note-Books&lt;/em&gt;. This circumstance, and the thoroughly un-German form of &lt;em&gt;The Twice-Told Tales&lt;/em&gt;, make it tolerably certain that the foreign influence was of the kind which is said to be &quot;in the air.&quot; One remembers that Edward Caryl, hero of Hawthorne's early story, &lt;em&gt;The Antique Ring&lt;/em&gt;, had been writing &quot;tales imbued with German mysticism.&quot; Just so with Hawthorne, whom this character thinly disguises. The evidence suffices merely to prove that he was &quot;imbued&quot; with the German phase of romanticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kinship with the Germans I have called spiritual. The like might be said of Hawthorne's relations to John Sterling, an English writer, but not of the annualist breed, who survives by virtue of Carlyle's biography of him, and Mrs. Carlyle's letters, rather than in the graceful sketches which, from 1828 to 1840, he contributed to &lt;em&gt;The Athenaum&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Blackwood's&lt;/em&gt;. Sterling infused these fanciful stories with an ethical or transcendental significance which, nowadays, we should call Hawthornesque. &lt;em&gt;The Palace of Morgiana&lt;/em&gt; (1837), &lt;em&gt;A Chronicle of England&lt;/em&gt; (1840) are instances in point. &quot;Wisdom's Pearl doth often dwell Closed in Fancy's rainbow shell,&quot; says the posy at the head of the latter story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawthorne, in his search for wisdom's pearl by means of fancy, resembles this contemporary Englishman. He is related to the German romanticists in his fondness for the weird, the mystical, and the supernormal manifestations of the spirit. It is unnecessary to establish more definitely his connection with the romantic movement, and we may, therefore, pass on to more important matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no desire to maintain that the prepotent personality of Hawthorne, a personality powerful enough to restamp into new coin both the gold and the alloy of the &quot; current story,&quot; was that of the typical American. Probably, as yet, there is no such type. But an American personality through and through, bred from home traditions, fostered upon home culture, and as independent of foreign influences as a cultured mind well could be, it is safe to maintain his to have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was American, for example, in combining the two traits which have been so often ascribed to us; on the one hand, a high idealism amounting to mysticism, on the other, an extreme desire for reality. Indeed, the conjunction of these two qualities in his character is the best point at which to enter upon the study of Hawthorne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;life-behind-the-veil&quot;&gt;Life Behind the Veil&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, for the secret of the idealism. &quot;His soul was like a star and dwelt apart.&quot; Hawthorne's solitary way of life, his fondness for the word &quot;recluse,&quot; the testimony of friends, make one sure that he would have been gratified had this line been applied to him. It is perfectly clear that his inmost thoughts seldom appear in the diaries which have been published as his notebooks. He scorns the Quaker who professed to know him through his works, and professes to despise the seemingly personal thoughts of the Mosses from an Old Manse. &quot;A cloudy veil stretches over the abyss of my nature.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he wrote in his notebook in 1843, &quot;I am glad to think that God sees through my heart, and, if any angel has power to penetrate into it, he is welcome to know anything that is there. Yes, and so may any mortal who is capable of full sympathy, and therefore worthy to come into my depths. But he must find his own way there. I can neither guide nor enlighten him. It is this involuntary reserve, I suppose, that has given the objectivity to my writings; and when people think that I am pouring myself out in a tale or essay, I am merely telling what is common to human nature, not what is peculiar to myself. I sympathize with them, not they with me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did the veil cover? It is easy to be scornful, and answer that it hid nothing more considerable than the moonings of a provincial thinker, who was at work upon old, old thoughts long since common property, although he supposed them to be mystical and his own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawthorne belonged to a group who did the thinking for their community, and that community was small. Although Emerson was one of the thinkers, and was assuredly busied with no stale thoughts, this is no proof that Hawthorne was original. However, such an uncomplimentary explanation is superficial. It does not explain the tremendous force of what did rise from out the abyss, and get itself expressed in Hawthorne's published works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we wish to know the truth, we must search these works. Had any startling novelty in clear thought lain behind the veil (and Hawthorne loved no thought that was not clear), would not some manifestation have irradiated his books?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would the hours of meditation have been thrown aside, and a new and shallower inspiration drawn upon for work the world was to see?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of his seeming denial, and no matter how imperfectly, these stories must retain some image of his mental life. If a man is busy with original thinking, original thought must come forth when he writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in Hawthorne's books no distinctly new ideas, no thoughts derived from novel methods of thinking appear, few conceptions excellent chiefly because they are fresh. &lt;em&gt;The Birthmark&lt;/em&gt; does not owe its force to novelty. There is nothing new in that representative story except details of plot and setting; its idea may be traced through languages and centuries. What we do find there is intensity. And it is not depth, but intensity of thinking which appears, to a varying degree, in all of Hawthorne's narratives. Though sometimes childlike in simplicity, cold and allegorical in expression, they have been conceived at white heat. Not originality, but force, is their prime characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the mind of this recluse seems to have been endowed with a certain attentiveness, like Poe's, but this time fastened upon the ethical manifestations of human nature, character, and the soul. It is this intense deliberation upon life which cast its shadow upon his diary, and was transmitted, with what seemed to the unhappy author a tremendous loss of intensity, to his stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This attentiveness, I believe, filled his hours of meditation, and deeply affected his outer life. It was a mania like Ethan Brand's, less serious, but sometimes, to judge from his diaries, scarcely less compelling. Indeed, Ethan's terrible obsession by the sin against the Holy Ghost is only a perverted image of Hawthorne's own mental peculiarities. An obsession by questions of ethics or character, this, to judge from what found its way into the outer world, was the governing principle of Hawthorne's inner life, the life behind the veil. It led to idealism, and, as we shall see, to idealism of a very exacting nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;hawthornes-puritanism&quot;&gt;Hawthorne's Puritanism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First a word, however, upon the unavoidable subject of Hawthorne's Puritanism. Those who have called him a Puritan seem to have recognized his preoccupation with moral problems, and sought to give it a name. A liberal-minded Unitarian, for whom dogma and the difficulty of salvation had only a nineteenth century interest, Hawthorne was, in no sense, a spiritual brother of such as Cotton Mather. But there is a mental resemblance. It may be that the peculiar intensity of thought, just commented upon, was an atavistic return to the witch-judges and religious fanatics among Hawthorne's forefathers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare his tales with the &lt;em&gt;Grace Abounding&lt;/em&gt; of one of his favorite authors, John Bunyan. Note, in the seventeenth century writer, the circuits of the mind round and round the problems of sin, of grace, of his soul's state, and the possibility of salvation, and then observe Hawthorne's attentiveness to the voices of his inner life. The subject-matter of the &lt;em&gt;Twice-Told Tales&lt;/em&gt; is character, ethics, and the nature of the soul, instead of sin, grace, and its chances of salvation, but the habit of mind, the conscientious introspectiveness, is identical. Thus far, Hawthorne is a Puritan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The lyf so short, the craft so longe to lerne.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawthorne never mastered his art, never, except in a few best instances, really controlled it. And this was not due to his provincial environment nor to a lack of persistence, but came about through his idealism, through the very ambition of an attempt to make his stories the ripe product of that secret inner life whose nature we have just been discussing. An extreme attentiveness to the nature of humanity must result in abstract thinking, no matter how intense the thoughts may be. Good narrative is concrete, and highly concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fully half of &lt;em&gt;The American Note-Books&lt;/em&gt; is made up of Hawthorne's struggles to turn one into another; of experiments in crystallizing the abstract into the concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A woman to sympathize with all emotions, but to have none of her own &quot;(1837).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A person to catch fire-flies, and try to kindle his household fire with them. It would be symbolical of something.&quot; (1838).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is one suggestive, and one apparently trivial example. In the first, an idea is caught and becomes graspable, but is not yet made so real that a story could grow from it. In the second, a symbol is recorded in the hope, it seems, that it may serve to make tellable some of the speculations which filled his brain. Both throw light on Hawthorne's artistic difficulties. The naked thought had to be clothed in the appearance of life before it could leave the abstract and become fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless given the most exact semblance to the affairs of this world, the moral would remain a moral, the axiom an axiom, the sermon a sermon, and no one would read the story; indeed, the story, regarded as a narrative of the actions of flesh and blood, would never come to life at all. And so, through all the notebooks, and in the completed stories, a discerning reader will see Hawthorne experimenting, practising with externals, which, fitted into words, could be used to cover or embody abstract ideas. In this, he exhibits that other phase of the typical American temperament, the desire for reality, the wish to &quot;get it down in black and white.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, we see the value of the innumerable &quot;strange characters,&quot; laboriously depicted in the notebooks. They were preliminary studies for the transformation of an abstract idea into a real Rappaccini's daughter or an Ethan Brand. With this in mind, we view sympathetically the scenes minutely described, particularly the little sensations of the day: &quot;a gush of violets along a wood path,&quot; or that observation which so annoyed one critic, &quot; the smell of peat-smoke in the autumnal air is very pleasant;&quot; and we understand his eagerness for measuring coal, earning his salary, all that the world called work, an eagerness which appears again and again in his letters. One biographer has been so misled by these externals as to make his narrative mainly an account of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But consider Hawthorne's artistic difficulties, and all of this yearning after the real and tangible falls into its proper place. Hawthorne knew that his early life had been mainly dreams. We do not need his confessions to tell us that he realized how difficult was the passage from those dreams to a presentation of them which his fellowmen could know to be real and true. It is written in every story, and echoes from his disappointment when he had done his best and knew that most of his fine rapture had escaped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For, though dedicated to meditation upon the philosophy of character, the desire came upon him to put souls into his ideas, to let them be characters and act as in life. He strove hard to make them real characters, as art demanded. But life, which has no formula, cannot be truly seen by one who views it only to clothe his formulas with reality. In art, no more than in the affairs of the world, can a man serve two masters and be sure of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of all efforts, in spite of a faithful, sometimes a tedious realism of detail, and an unusual truth of portrayal, the thought would not altogether fuse with the narrative, the abstract did not entirely dissolve, and sermon or philosophy still choked the flow of the story. Hawthorne was true not first, but last, to the realities of the concrete world which lay without his mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-desire-to-make-a-narrative&quot;&gt;The Desire to Make A Narrative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect of this divided allegiance upon the stories themselves is almost pathetically easy to trace. No man was ever more clearly possessed of the itch of story-telling than Hawthorne. Busied with some problem of character, his mind would often be seized with the desire to make a narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first result was a plot-nugget recorded in one of the notebooks. Then, but sometimes years later, came the story. If no strong thought was striving to express itself, if it was to be a tale like &lt;em&gt;The Seven Vagabonds&lt;/em&gt;, where careful external descriptions, thrown into striking contrasts, were enough for success, see how easily his pen runs along the path of almost uninterrupted narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the tale means much to the author, if there is a strong thought to be packed into it, observe his struggles. Follow through, for instance, the career of &lt;em&gt;The Birthmark&lt;/em&gt;. Its embryo is in &lt;em&gt;The American Note-Books&lt;/em&gt; for 1840.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A person to be the death of his beloved in trying to raise her to more than mortal perfection; yet this should be a comfort to him for having aimed so highly and holily.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such a crystallization of thought, the first reaction has taken place between the speculation of the recluse and the desire to give it to other men in a tangible fashion. It lacks, of course, both characters and a practicable plot; these, when added, should complete a transformation from abstract to concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Aylmer, the hero, is scarcely flesh and blood. He is a formula, conceived with the idea written down in the 1840 notebook. A clothing of life-likeness has been painstakingly given to him that he may seem a real chemist, at real work, and with a most worldly ambition. It fits, as well as clothing, but not so well as the skin he should have been born with. In spite of honest trying, Hawthorne could not make this formula live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, nevertheless, are materials for a good short story: a powerful idea, reasonably effective characters, to which is added the splendid plot of the crimson hand. For a realization of the potentiality of these materials, sermon should now be dropped, narrative should move unhampered. It does move, and with an intensity which makes you never forget it, but the movement is not all on a right line. When Aylmer fails and Georgiana's birthmark fades away in death, &quot;a hoarse, chuckling laugh was heard again! Thus ever does the gross fatality of earth exult in its invariable triumph over the immortal essence which, in this dim sphere of half-development, demands the completeness of the higher state.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawthorne could not leave it alone! He felt the intense truth of his original idea so strongly that he must needs thus emphasize it and at the very climax. Indeed, he has enlarged, and varied the sermon at other places in the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a speaker who spoils an argument by oscillating between its two main points, he swings from the more or less concrete Aylmer and the crimson hand upon the cheek of Georgiana, to abstract humanity and its failure to achieve the highest, then back again, with disastrous effect upon artistic unity and narrative vividness. &lt;em&gt;The Birthmark&lt;/em&gt; strikes deep, it has durable stuff in it, but o' that Hawthorne conceiving, it had been constructed and written by Poe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-peculiarly-ethical-nature-of-hawthornes-short-stories&quot;&gt;The Peculiarly Ethical Nature of Hawthorne's Short Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis, and the theory which preceded it, explains, I believe, the peculiarly ethical nature of all of Hawthorne's short stories. They are the fruit of an intense and abstract speculation upon character, in which has been placed the fructifying graft of expression for the benefit of other men. This, too, explains their failure in the eyes of their author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Owen Warland's mechanical butterfly in &lt;em&gt;The Artist of the Beautiful&lt;/em&gt;, which droops and fades upon the practical finger of Peter Hovenden, the materialist, so Hawthorne's imaginings lost some of their color and beauty when they were translated into the terms of human experience. He fought against this partial failure, and exulted when, after vainly thinking that he could &quot;imagine all passions, all feelings, and states of heart and mind,&quot; there came the touch upon the heart which made it possible to conceive &quot;beings of reality,&quot; to &quot;send thoughts and feelings any distance — and transfuse them warm and fresh into the consciousness of those whom we love&quot; (1840).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he never ceased being philosopher long enough to be all artist, and of his failure to put the final and perfect stamp upon his refined gold he seems, in spite of these words, to have been well aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, Hawthorne made progress. He had too much genius not to understand that mere allegories would not do, nor disquisitions on familiar problems mingled with narrative examples. If many of &lt;em&gt;The Twice-Told Tales&lt;/em&gt; are called, as Poe suggested, essays outright, others are far better narrative, and the best of his later stories testify, by the effect they have made upon some three or four generations of readers, to the success of their art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, by a strange circumstance, but, in view of what has just been said, a natural one, his most artistic stories are not his best. Imagination is to the fore in the &lt;em&gt;Legends of the Province House&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The White Old__Maid&lt;/em&gt;, and that &lt;em&gt;Hollow of the Three Hills&lt;/em&gt; which Poe admired, and structure, color, and unity of effect all respond. Nevertheless, his best stories are those in which the native mood of the man expresses itself most powerfully, and as this mood was ethically philosophical, so these stories are no mere tales of imaginative effect, but convey, every one of them, a weighty and philosophical moral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Stone Face&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Birthmark&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Ambitious Guest&lt;/em&gt;, with a few others like them, are the great tales. They have artistic defects in abundance, but also an intensity and a power of narrative which gives preeminence over the more perfect stories of less specific gravity. If the narrative had only dissolved the moral we should have had Poe exceeded. But can the snake swallow himself? The more strongly this modern Puritan thought and felt, the more difficult it was to sink the idea in the figure. And in a recluse, and an independent, it is not surprising that his art never grew fast enough to master a personality which grew faster still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;hawthornes-inner-life-and-need-of-expression&quot;&gt;Hawthorne's Inner Life and Need of Expression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, it has seemed to be most important to study the nature of that reaction between Hawthorne's inner life and his need of expression which explains so much that is characteristic in his stories. So doing, I have neglected all excellencies except those of moral and spiritual force, and perhaps overemphasized the artistic defects of his narrative. For, when all is said, it is impossible to assign to Hawthorne any rank but a high one as a story-teller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We grumble at his moralizing, but we read his tales, and it is probable that the next generation will read them with as much interest. The reasons for this enduring interest are complex, but not obscure. He was blessed with far more humor than Poe possessed, and, in situations where character is involved, quite enough of it to account for much of the flavor of the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Hawthorne's mind was prevailingly somber; he had not the elasticity of view-point which belongs to the great humorist. As for style, in his own vein, when romance is to the fore, and exposition left behind, the movement of his prose is unequaled in American literature for mellow richness or for dignity. It is an early Victorian, or a pre-Victorian, style, like Lamb's, De Quincey's, and Thackeray's, a style charged with poetical feeling, and pleasantly savoring of archaism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it never reaches the rhythmic ecstasy of Poe, it never sins by excess of rhetorical music. Bad taste of one kind is to be found in Hawthorne, but it is a false taste in minor matters which misled him in artistic judgment, and never followed, as with Poe, into the higher regions of imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, with rare exceptions, he is a high artist in words, a great stylist even when he most fails in the attempt to weld structure, idea, character, and diction into one artistic unity. Again, he is a good, if not a great romanticist. But his stories owe their longevity most of all to the power of their author as an analyst of character and as a sane thinker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this respect, Hawthorne is infinitely more successful than Poe. Measure him by the standards of moral inspiration, of ethical influence, by any standards save those of high art, and he deserves the nobler rating. The flighty mind of Poe, morbid, fertile of poses, full of egotisms, proficient in short cuts to the profundities, is almost pitiful when one compares it with this New England brain, independent, steady, ready for little tasks, hiding its power, yet glowing white hot with its own intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe, the greater artist indubitably, was the lesser man. Hawthorne said more, if he said it less well. He is worthy of his high place among American writers. And his stories are great stories, even in their imperfection, even though they are made up of,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Thoughts hardly to be packed Into a narrow act,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fancies that broke through language and escaped.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawthorne's position in the development of the short story may now be reckoned with some justice. First, it is clear that he belongs, with Irving and Poe, to the trinity of Americans who, by structure, or by substance, or by both, gave specific gravity to the short story when, through the romantic movement, it was cut free from eighteenth century didacticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in substance that he rendered his greatest service. Under his pen, the story was supercharged with literary quality, so that the shortness of &lt;em&gt;Ethan Brand&lt;/em&gt; is as far from intimating that it lacks excellence as the brevity of a lyric from implying triviality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In structure his services are less notable, not so much because he could not construct, as that, for reasons already explained, his best story material was at war with a purely narrative development. It is interesting to compare &lt;em&gt;The__Ambitious Guest&lt;/em&gt; of 1835 with Poe's &lt;em&gt;Berenice&lt;/em&gt;, published in the same year. In the former, a tragedy of an avalanche, it is important that the reader should know that the climax is not the death of all in the great slide, but the sudden end of that ambition which has been spreading infectiously from the guest to the simple household of his hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a master of story-telling to realize this, as Hawthorne did, and the mere attempt to accomplish such a purpose by means of a simple situation is enough to make a good short story. But whereas &lt;em&gt;Berenice&lt;/em&gt; moves uninterruptedly to its horrid conclusion, this far nobler story is halted, like &lt;em&gt;The Birthmark&lt;/em&gt;, while ambition in the abstract is lugged in to be talked about and moralized upon until there should be no doubt as to the significance of the tale. The substance, unified purpose, harmonious tone of the story, measure its value; the structure does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one feature, however, Hawthorne's method of storytelling led the way towards the full development of the modern type. Why (to come at it Socratically), with an inherent proneness to construct a story badly, did this American write tales which, after all, are better made than those of any contemporary writer exclusive of Irving, Poe, Balzac, Merimee, Gautier, and possibly Poushkin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For, say your worst against the architectonics of &lt;em&gt;The Twice-Told Tales&lt;/em&gt;, and then try to match them in England or in Germany of this period! The answer, again-, is to be worked out through &lt;em&gt;The American Note-Books&lt;/em&gt;. Scattered through them are those aforesaid notes for future stories, nearly all, and all of the best, not so much plots as situations, that is, not successions of incidents, but relationships of character to character, or of character to circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;To have ice in one's blood.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A phantom of the old royal governors, — on the night of the evacuation of Boston by the British.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The print in blood of a naked foot to be traced through the streets of a town.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, Hawthorne, in these instances, had conceived a striking relationship in which some character was to be placed, a relationship, single and unified, which was to be the upshot of the story. Howe's &lt;em&gt;Masquerade&lt;/em&gt; was made from the second of these items; there, Lord Howe's interesting situation is certainly the gist of the tale. Make a story of a situation, as Hawthorne did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the majority of cases, it must be a short story to be effective; it must have unity of impression, and the final impression will be of the situation with which the writer began his thinking, for otherwise the tale will have missed its point. Furthermore, it must have harmony of tone, that requisite of the modern short story, for otherwise no subtle situation can be expressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus, to answer the introductory question, certainly, in some degree, it was because Hawthorne chose situations to work up into stories that the completed narratives, in spite of all handicaps, attained a moderately good short-story form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of such material as Hawthorne's situations, nearly all modern short stories are made! To express the myriads of situations in which we subjective moderns find ourselves, and in which we are interested, the technique of the modern short story has its raison d'etre! Thus, it is in his emphasis of a situation as a subject for a short narrative that Hawthorne's importance in the development of the modern short story chiefly lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Poe, one reached the technique able to convey an intense impression, sometimes of simple terror, or horror, sometimes of a terrible or horrible situation. With Hawthorne, the introspective, the analytical, comes a greater interest in the situation than in the impression to be made by means of it. Sometimes he fails to turn his situation into a plot-story, as, for example, in &lt;em&gt;The Gray Champion&lt;/em&gt;; sometimes he half tells, half expounds it, as in &lt;em&gt;Rappaccini's Daughter&lt;/em&gt;. But, nevertheless, it was his kind of work which widened the scope of the short story, which gave it play elsewhere than in tales of ratiocination and impressionistic terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Hawthorne, far more truly than Poe, who first bent it toward a great usefulness, the uncovering of those brief, yet poignant, situations which interest us in modern life. The machine for turning his profound situations into story was a little crude, a little stiff in its workings, and sometimes refused to work at all, but he put in sound grain at the hopper, and he got good grist, even though only moderately well ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably no one ever learned how best to tell a short story from his method, but many must have been taught that it was a situation, and not a chain of incidents, which the short story was best fitted to express.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One must understand Hawthorne's introspective nature, and his attentiveness to the problems of humanity, in order to comprehend his short stories. Then, with an added knowledge of how hard it was to make intense thoughts real and communicable, and how much he desired to do so, it is easy to recognize both the defects and the excellencies of these twice-told tales. Such a sympathetic knowledge will take us further; the very nature of his meditations led him to seize upon striking situations, situations which his attentive mind must have dwelt upon in solitude until the story shaped itself, dwelt upon, sometimes, until too much of the reflection hardened into moralizing and remained to clog the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, indeed, in a Hawthornesque fashion, is a formula for Hawthorne, a formula which connects him with the historical development of our short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">Hawthorne, in his search for wisdom’s pearl by means of fancy, resembles this contemporary Englishman. He is related to the German romanticists in his fondness for the weird, the mystical, and the supernormal manifestations of the spirit. It is unnecessary to establish more definitely his connection with the romantic movement, and we may, therefore, pass on to more important matters.</summary>

&lt;/section&gt; table-of-contents --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last third of the century saw the new short story thoroughly established in America, its scope marvelously broadened, its popularity steadily increasing, and the general level of technical excellence rising almost as fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a previous chapter I have discussed midcentury short narrative in England, and endeavored to do justice to the excellent novelettes of Dickens, the exquisite brief tales of Mrs. Gaskell and Dr. Brown, the almost impressionistic stories of Henry Kingsley. These writers added their pound or their mite to English literature. But not until 1877, and Robert Louis Stevenson's first published narrative, does any Englishman of real caliber show both desire and ability to do something new with the short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This narrative was &lt;em&gt;A Lodging for the Night&lt;/em&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Temple Bar&lt;/em&gt; for October, and followed by &lt;em&gt;Will o' the Mill&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Cornhill Magazine&lt;/em&gt; for January, 1878, and &lt;em&gt;The Sire de Maletroit's Door&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Temple Bar&lt;/em&gt; for the same month. &lt;em&gt;A Lodging for the Night&lt;/em&gt; is as clearly and consciously an impressionistic short story as George Meredith's contemporary novelettes are not of that category; the two stories which followed would assure the most timid critic of our generation that here was a master in this department of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is strange that the English discovery of the impressionistic short story should have come so late. Perhaps there is something antipathetic to the British temperament in so restrained and so graceful an art. The American masters, even Poe, have been very American, the French excessively French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the chief tellers of the short story in England all betray a foreign tincture. Kipling is a colonial, Conrad a Slav, Maurice Hewlett Italianate. And Stevenson was a Francophile from his youth up. The French affiliations of Stevenson it is unnecessary, at this late date, to prove. It is not so easy, however, to determine the effect of his interest in things French, for the results are blended with the Scotch and the English in the man, and with that which was neither Scotch nor English, but just himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarded as an artist in narrative, he is probably indebted to France, and his admirations there, for the influence which made him cope, and cope successfully, with the artistic problems presented by the short story. This influence is not so gross as to be reckoned in terms of a specific source. It is to be traced through his artistic conscience and still more through his conception of what should be done in the telling of a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the best French literature leaves a sense of perfect finish, and a complete satisfaction with the way the thing has been done, irrespective of what that thing may be. Call it a result of the Latin sense of form, call it French grace, call it what you will, at least it is easily recognizable. Something of this perfection of expression, and as much of this French grace, appears in every story, long and short, of Stevenson's. Indeed, in the short stories it even determines the mode of the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French counsel of perfection demanded the perfect form, and this, for the short narratives of his contemporaries in France, was the impressionistic short story, in which the French for some decades had been successful, though, hitherto, without marked influence upon English work. Naturally it became the perfect form for Stevenson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these circumstances in mind, read, for an example, that bijou, &lt;em&gt;The Sire de Malétroits Door&lt;/em&gt; — &quot;a true novel, in the old sense; all unities preserved moreover, if that's anything,&quot; so Stevenson wrote of it in a letter to Sidney Colvin, August, 1877.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting is good medieval French; that, however, is not to the point. The plot is romance of the English rather than the French brand. But the exquisite nicety of incident, moving step by step, from the swing of the door which traps the hero, to the cruel uncle who condemns, the maiden who scorns, who weeps, who melts just as the night turns into dawn—this quality of perfect balance is French. It is hard to describe otherwise in words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, if in his taste and in his counsels of perfection Stevenson is French, in the subject-matter of his short stories he is Anglo-Saxon. His thoughts on life are not French thoughts. His themes remind one of Hawthorne, not of Maupassant. There is &lt;em&gt;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&lt;/em&gt;, that short story thrown over into the form of a detective romance. What Frenchman would have concluded the narrative, not with the throes of a final transformation, but with the last moralizing of Jekyll upon Hyde! I do not say that Stevenson's climax is inferior; merely that it is, typically, an English one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or there is &lt;em&gt;Markheim&lt;/em&gt;, a story less powerful in execution, but more excellent in workmanship, and an almost ideal example of the impressionistic short story. Flaubert might have written the description of the curiosity shop as the murderer saw it, with its accusing clock-voices, its wavering shadows, from the inner door &quot;a long slit of daylight like a pointing finger.&quot; And Flaubert would have praised the skilful gradation of incident and description, whereby conscience gains and gains in the struggle for Markheim's mind. But Hawthorne would have been prouder still of the plot—a weak man with a remnant of high ideals suddenly realizing that his curve is plotted and can lead him only downwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how un-French is the entrance of that mysterious visitor who comes in as the devil and retires revealed as a kind of Puritan Almighty, tempting in order that the soul may be tried and repent! How like to Hawthorne's usual way is Stevenson's determination to make, at all costs, a moral issue the outcome of his story! Indeed, this lover of the French touch is thoroughly Anglo-Saxon in his choice of situations for his stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor is this conclusion restricted to Stevenson's experiments in man's moral nature. &lt;em&gt;Will o' the Mill&lt;/em&gt; is like a twice-told tale not only in theme; its whole effect is Hawthornesque. &lt;em&gt;A Lodging for the Night&lt;/em&gt; has for its kernel a question of ethics. Even &lt;em&gt;The Sire de Malétroits Door&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Merry Men&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Providence and a Guitar&lt;/em&gt;, are concerned with honor, with unselfishness, or with the result of crime!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have compared Hawthorne with Stevenson as the writer in English most readily typifying the racial tendency towards moral analysis in narrative. Of the two, Stevenson is the better craftsman. He makes his setting real; he makes his characters act, and be influenced, and change, with greater verisimilitude, beauty, and ease. His pen was more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French authors had taught him to be more tireless in the search for perfect expression. But his superior craftsmanship is, perhaps, due quite as much to a lack of intensity as to a keener pursuit of art. His ideas are more novel, less fundamental than Hawthorne's. It must have been easier to put them into concrete form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is possibly a deficiency, certainly not a fault. But Stevenson's counsel of perfect expression did lead him astray. He did not overpolish. That is impossible. But he made his polishing too evident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &quot;brutal and licentious public, snouting in Mudie's wash-trough,&quot; persisted in thinking, so he said, &quot;that striking situations, or good dialogue, are got by studying life; they will not rise to understand that they are prepared by deliberate artifice and set off by painful suppressions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, it was unnecessary to inform even the snouters that deliberate artifice was being practised in his own works. The thing is palpable in every phrase where the words are the &lt;em&gt;dernier cri&lt;/em&gt; in specificness, and in each rhythm tuned to a superperfect harmony. Yet, though palpable, this artifice is not unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, at his best, the exquisite Euphuism which this supreme polisher could produce is sheer delight. No story in the world reads better aloud than &lt;em&gt;The Sire de Malétroits Door&lt;/em&gt;, no phrasing in contemporary prose thrills the ear more entrancingly than certain passages in &lt;em&gt;Will o' the Mill&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Prince Otto&lt;/em&gt;. But is it not—Euphuism? And, if it is Euphuism, will it not suffer with a change of taste?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose this to be true. Suppose these flowered sentences, graceful rhythms, vivid words, should eventually mar the excellency of the stories which they adorn. Something will remain. Stevenson's keen studies of our moral nature, the essential Englishness of which we have just been discussing, must possess an enduring value; the grace and beauty of his story's form will continue worthy, even if his style should lose its charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last of all comes his place in the development of the short story, and here what has just been reckoned a fault must be counted again, and as a virtue. Stevenson is the great polisher of the short story. He finally elevates modern short narrative above the suspicion of triviality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawthorne had given it dignity without flexibility, Poe beauty without a solid basis, and a generation replete with hasty writers had followed. The services of a stylist were needed, and, in Stevenson, secured. Furthermore, he set the impressionistic story upon its feet in England, and upon a firmer base in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are, so far as I know, three ways, and three ways only, of writing a story,&quot; so he said to Graham Balfour, as reported in the latter's &lt;em&gt;Life of Robert Louis Stevenson, ii. 169.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;'You may take a plot and fit characters to it, or you may take a character and choose incidents and situations to develop it, or lastly—you must bear with me while I try to make this clear '—(here he made a gesture with his hand as if he were trying to shape something and give it outline and form)—'you may take a certain atmosphere, and get action and persons to express and realize it. I'll give you an example—&lt;em&gt;The Merry Men&lt;/em&gt;. There I began with the feeling of one of those islands on the west coast of Scotland, and I gradually developed the story to express the sentiment with which that coast affected me.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third item in this description, when interpreted freely, defines Stevenson's purpose in the short story. He shoots straight at a mark, the single effect, and employs every word in the aiming. As well aware of just what he wished to accomplish as Poe or Henry James, he influenced his own contemporaries more than the former, and was read far more widely than the latter. He became an authoritative sponsor for the new short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can hardly be said that Stevenson conquered new fields for this short story. But he did make it beautiful. Sometimes his artistry in words obscures the movement of the life those words should reveal. The clothes which adorn the figure may hamper its free and natural movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the vividness of his moral stories, the grace of his lighter tales, and the beauty of all, will enable his admirers to endure with some equanimity the detractions which lurk for the reputation of the polisher and perfecter of style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chronicler of the rise of the short story must enter upon the last two decades of progress with prayer and fasting. The short story has become multitudinous. Every seed has yielded forty-fold. At first glance, it may seem that this chapter should be either a book, or a list like the list of the Homeric ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book must be written, but we are too near the stories to do it now. The list has already been attempted in part by various bibliographical workers. Fortunately, the plan of this critical study requires neither alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, an account of the progress of any mode of literary expression must be like a history of art. The historian deals chiefly with two classes, the small beginnings of great developments, and the masterpieces which represent the height of attainment. Of these two, the small beginnings are usually of infinitely less value artistically than the masterpieces. Their historical value, however, is as great, and this makes them far more significant than works, superior in technique, which possess neither virtue of originality, nor distinction of supreme excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disadvantages of this historical method are evident; too evident in these concluding chapters. Upon earlier stories of small literary worth space has often been expended which cannot now be allowed to contemporary narratives with an intrinsic value as much greater as their historical importance is less. It is unfortunate that Miss Wilkins or Mr. Hewlett should be dismissed with sentences, when the unspeakable story of the annuals was given paragraphs. But this is a necessary evil of the chronicle of fashions in literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like nature, the historian must care most for the type, and assume that humble beginnings throw light on all that follows, while master-works contain in microcosm the characteristics of the less important efforts of the age. The development of our short story has been, in some measure, cumulative. Much of the criticism already applied to earlier periods, if just, will remain to eke out an enforced brevity in this discussion of the turn of the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;rudyard-kipling--the-vigorous-versatile--consummate-master-of-the-short-story&quot;&gt;Rudyard Kipling – The Vigorous, Versatile &amp;amp; Consummate Master of the Short Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the earlier chapters have dealt with beginnings. From the enormous short-story literature of the past twenty years, I shall select the work of one commanding figure, Rudyard Kipling, as the best means of illustrating what we have finally done with the short story. This choice is possible because Kipling is, on the whole, the most vigorous, versatile, and highly endowed among contemporary writers of fiction. Next, because his colonial life, and his transatlantic connections make him more Anglo-Saxon than British. And, finally, for the reason that, in his time, no English-writing author has shown such consummate mastery of the short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is as difficult to review Kipling's short stories as to characterize East Side New York. They are quite as multifarious. But in all their kaleidoscopic variety, in bad and in good, there is one distinctive quality. It is not merely style; nor is it any one of the many technical perfections with which these stories abound. It is neither romanticism nor realism. This quality I shall endeavor to define, for I believe it to be the essence of what Kipling has done that is new and personal in the short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us strike into the trail at the beginning when, in 1890, the sudden popularity in London of &lt;em&gt;Plain Tales from the Hills&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Soldiers Three&lt;/em&gt; and other early volumes began Kipling's international reputation. These narratives were &quot;heady&quot; stories, like Peacock's, which Beetle of &lt;em&gt;Stalky &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/em&gt; used to read. They are chiefly intrigues, or military escapades, with mysterious India for a background. Many of them seem thin enough now. Nearly all are too flippant; their author too often is provokingly sure of the motives which rule all actions, or absurdly interested in the social idiosyncrasies of Simla. The short story with a twist at the end of it, the short story that surprises, is operated unmercifully until its artificiality is painfully apparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, with the cheap sensationalism of some of these stories came the glamor of them all, the glamor of a racial contrast more vivid than any hitherto depicted. India, with its innumerable facets, for the first time was made real to the layman. The ten times mysterious East dazzled him with its Babus, saises. Sahibs, Sikhs, and the inexorable Indian service. The romance of the inscrutable differences between races and peoples inflamed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quote from the beginning of the first story in Plain Tales, because it happens to be first: &quot;She was the daughter of Soonoo, a Hill-man of the Himalayas, and Jadeh, his wife. One year their maize failed, and two bears spent the night in their only opium poppy-field just above the Sutlej Valley on the Kotgarh side; so, next season, they turned Christian, and brought their baby to the Mission to be baptized.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Anglo-Saxons, already enthusiastic over strange corners of the world, there was fascination in &quot;Hill-man,&quot; in &quot;the Sutlej Valley on the Kotgarh side,&quot; in the idea of turning Christian because a bear eats up one's poppy-field! Yet this was only child's magic as compared with what was to follow. As a sheer story-teller, Kipling had not reached a tithe of the powers of Bret Harte, who was, possibly, his model. But his racial color and his racial contrasts, even in these early stories, were more intense than Harte's or any man's. &lt;em&gt;Plain Tales&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Soldiers Three&lt;/em&gt; gave him the reputation of an adept in local color, and every succeeding volume was to increase it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But local color is not a condition; it is a capability dependent upon a power over words. &quot;Over our heads burned the wonderful Indian stars;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quote from &lt;em&gt;The Courting of Dina Shadd&lt;/em&gt;, &quot;which are not all pricked in on one plane; but, preserving an orderly perspective, draw the eye through the velvet darkness of the void up to the barred doors of heaven itself. The earth was a gray shadow more unreal than the sky. We could hear her breathing lightly in the pauses between the howling of the jackals, the movement of the wind in the tamarisks, and the fitful mutter of musketry-fire leagues away to the left. A native woman from some unseen hut began to sing, the mail-train thundered past on its way to Delhi, and a roosting crow cawed drowsily.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such description the words make one feel the very essence of the novelty, the full force of the contrast which is contained in the new environment. In such work, Kipling becomes, sometimes, a prose Keats. The comparison should not be repellent, for it regards words and power over sensation merely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the drug-clerk in &lt;em&gt;Wireless&lt;/em&gt; became &quot;temporarily an induced Keats,&quot; and groped painfully for the &quot;five little lines — of which one can say: 'These are the pure Magic. These are the clear Vision. The rest is only poetry,'&quot; so Kipling, in his earliest stories, felt painfully, often inaccurately, for the specific word which would photograph the contrasts of India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often he was successful. Sometimes he was merely sensational, which means only that he was vivid beyond the restraint of art. But the groping ceased when he gave life to the jungle, and put into words the might of steam and England's ancient peace. All this is one cause for his success in the field of local color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kipling won praise for his technique as speedily as for his local color. Technique with him means focus. That famous story of Mulvaney, his &quot;the-ourisin Lift'nint,&quot; and the company of &quot;raw bhoys&quot; who were hurled naked from the Irriwaddy into the midst of Lungtungpen to triumph and a blushing victory — this story, for example, is focused like an astronomer's stellar field. Masses of Burmah scenery, a plot-idea, and the wonderful personality of Mulvaney, these are the elements. The personality slips into place as the teller of the story; and that is one turn of the screw for adjusting the lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, Burmah becomes a real background. Jingles, bamboo huts, elephants, the black river full of logs, provide local color for the tale. This is the second turn of the screw. Then the whole is unified by the plot-idea that raw troops can take a town, even when they are naked. Here is yet another turn, and the toning up of the whole is the final adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In perfection, the technique which results from the process I have somewhat fancifully described is so excellent that all structure, all effort is concealed. The narrative in &lt;em&gt;On Greenhow Hill&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, is leisurely, like the big man who takes you with him to the bare Yorkshire moors and black mine- pits as he tells it on a Himalaya pine slope. &lt;em&gt;.007&lt;/em&gt; is all hurry and bustle, with rhythmic outbursts and a vibrant motion like the sway of a locomotive. Yet each is focused upon its climax, and the focus is its technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in this extraordinary power of focusing the story that the distinctive quality, which orients all the elements of Kipling's work, comes near the surface and may be grasped. As Poe worked over his technique in order to get substantial effects from insubstantial romanticism, so Kipling took pains with his because he passionately desired to be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning as an ordinary journalist, he learned, as anyone who reads &lt;em&gt;From Sea to Sea&lt;/em&gt; will observe, the first journalistic lesson — you must write of what is interesting. Whatever else he learned or forgot in later years, he has never forsaken that law. Even when he discourses upon the faults of the English army, he is reasonably interesting, and to an American! In his flippant and most uproarious stories he interests, even those whom he shocks. To be interesting, indeed, is the motto, the principle of modern journalism; and no one has more warmly adopted it than Rudyard Kipling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is our best example of this modern institution when raised to its highest power. He is the great journalist, and journalism is the pervading quality which we have been seeking in his works. Focus, and so a good technique, is actually the result of this same principle. The &quot;points&quot; of Lungtungpen, for instance, are those which would headline themselves; furthermore, they are arranged so as to secure the most effective outlay of the material. The story is written as a skilful correspondent would write up a battle or a football game — if he could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And is not this journalistic principle also responsible for some part of Kipling's devotion to the specific word, the word which is bound to stir the interest of the reader? Is it not to be found again in his searching observation of the racial contrasts which interest a generation preoccupied with Darwinism and the differentiation of species? Is it not the moving spirit in his local color as well as his technique?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fu-Lee keeps upon his children's counter some wooden eggs, gaudily striped, and cloven in the middle. Open one, and you find a smaller egg. Open that, and you see another, and so on, until in the midst is a mandarin, cross-legged, egg-shaped, and tucked away there in the middle as an excuse for the whole operation. The foregoing analysis of Kipling's powers of local color and technique has been a like unshelling. The process revealed the figure of the journalist. Let the eggs, from which have been extracted all useful reflections upon Kipling's art as a short-story teller, be put aside, and see what further conjury may be wrought with the mandarin of journalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kipling's humor is the most British thing about him. It is solid, deep-reaching, unmistakable, and at the furthest remove from wit or the American joke. In it are some of the faults of the early nineteenth century, the roughness and horse-play of Thomas Hood and his magazine imitators. Yet Kipling is infinitely their superior. The early nineteenth century humorists of his kind were often tedious; Kipling seldom is, and then only through over-strenuosity. Far too skilful for such crudity, he modulates with pathos and pure narrative. He selects the most humorous humor, as when the rear-end of Mulvaney's elephant blocks the British army in the Tangi pass. He makes use of the brevity of the short story. It is the pursuit of mirth by journalistic methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kipling did not attain to pathos as quickly as to humor. In his early stories, the pathetic is most successful when used as a foil to the comic. Mulvaney's power upon the reader in such a tale as &lt;em&gt;The Courting of Dinah Shadd&lt;/em&gt; comes from the depths of sorrow behind his humor. It was not until &lt;em&gt;Without Benefit of Clergy&lt;/em&gt; (1892) that he came to his full strength in pathetic prose. The history of Ameera is one of the triumphs of the short story. Its characterization is vivid; its progress direct and poignant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not wish even for an instant to seem to cheapen one of the most touching and beautiful stories in the world when I call it journalism. But the voice of the desolate mother breaking into the nursery rhyme of the wicked crow,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;And the wild plums grow in the jungle, only a penny a pound, Only a penny a pound, baba — only –,&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and every pathetic moment, is chosen by an inspired sense for what would most feelingly grasp the interest of the reader. This is high art, with intense feeling behind it — otherwise it would not be so excellent. But it is also good journalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much the same, when we view Mr. Kipling from the angle of the short story, is to be said of his work with character. He has already presented the world with one individual quite universally familiar to readers of English, the wonderful Mulvaney. But is Mulvaney like Pickwick or Colonel Newcome? Is not even this wonderful Irishman as much a means as an end, a means for the interesting transfer to the reader of impressions of British India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly this stricture, if it is a stricture, would apply to many, if not most, of Kipling's characters. They ring true, usually; they are always individual; but one feels that, excellent as they may be as personalities, their chief use is to discharge what interests Mr. Kipling and ourselves. For pure character work one must come, indeed, to individuals so elemental in their nature that they are not to be reckoned as &quot;characters&quot; at all, to those dear friends of &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Books&lt;/em&gt;, Baloo, Bagheera, and Kaa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, no particular reason why Mr. Kipling should not handle character as he pleases. As it happens, he has chosen the journalistic method. He gets all he can from his actors for the interest of his story. He fairly squeezes them. And this view is borne out by the frequency with which he depicts figures that are distinctly &quot;interest-getters.&quot; He prefers to deal with men who have killed dacoits, handled districts, seen forbidden things, put down border wars, talked to elephants, or been bewitched. The fascination exerted by his mystics is almost without parallel in contemporary literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not say that this is bad art. On the contrary, with so much current that is dull, it is admirable, except when overdone. But it shows the influence of the little mandarin of high journalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word journalism has such prosaic connotations that half the wonder in Kipling's stories escapes when you apply that name to them. The effect, however, will not be so appalling if one considers well what journalism is. The journalist is one of the agents, perhaps one of the most important agents, for the expression of our Zeitgeist. He is born of the desire to seek out news of the human creature, news of his habits, of his environment, of his mind and soul. Thus, as a journalist, Kipling is about the business of the Zeitgeist. As a great journalist, he has raised journalism to the heights of literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Zeitgeist has also inspired our short story. Like journalism, the latter is a manifestation of a nervous, curious, introspective age; it is as often superficial and sensational; as often vivid and interesting. Without our Zeitgeist, we should have known neither the one nor the other. Journalism, therefore, is not out of place; it is most proper in the practice of the short story. Kipling, in his own way, emphasized its right there. He does not cheapen his art by doing so; he enriches it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This journalistic quality, then, is the secret of Kipling's touch, the touch which gives his stories the distinction one feels and seeks from &lt;em&gt;Plain Tales&lt;/em&gt; to the end. Upon his early narratives the effect was bad as often as it was good. Sometimes they are made sensational, sometimes vivid. But after the first fumbling is passed, one begins to understand the value of a genius for the striking and the interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This it is that fires those tales of the northern border: &lt;em&gt;The Man Who Would Be King&lt;/em&gt;, a story as brilliant and barbaric as the crown of gold and tourquoise which Peachey brings back from his awful kingdom; &lt;em&gt;The Man Who Was&lt;/em&gt;, which, in one tense evening, displays all the horror of death-in-life and exile in contrast with patriotism and infinite pity; &lt;em&gt;The Drums of the Fore and Aft&lt;/em&gt;, with its two drunken, hysterical drummer-boys, playing a regiment into victory. This creates &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Books&lt;/em&gt;, those stories so vivid, as well as so true to romance, that, for once, our modern interest in beast- ways becomes literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;.007&lt;/em&gt;, this endows a locomotive with a human heart. And only such a genius could inspire the daring speculation of &lt;em&gt;Wireless&lt;/em&gt;. Here is the romance of &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Books&lt;/em&gt;, the vivid adventure of the tales of the border, the subtle mysticism of &lt;em&gt;Wireless&lt;/em&gt;, to which might be added as many instances more, every one given its distinctive touch by vividness and an utter novelty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation elaborated in each is not only significant, as with Hawthorne, it is interesting to the highest degree. The working out is not only skilful, as with Henry James, it is vivid and interesting to the highest degree. In brief, the skill of a trained journalist has lent freshness and power to good narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-power-in-the-narrative-to-express-the-emotion-of-the-story&quot;&gt;The Power in the Narrative To Express the Emotion of the Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am quite aware that, in this criticism, I do not carry all readers with me. Even those who are hurried away by the enthusiasm of &lt;em&gt;.007&lt;/em&gt;, who thrill with Dravot on the terrible bridge, or would become a wolf-man to have such a friend as Bagheera of the Broken Lock, might hesitate before admitting the force of the argument. For the desire to be interesting is a dangerous ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May it not be responsible for the transitory, not the permanent values of Kipling's stories? Will not this very effort to search out what interests our generation defeat its own object with the next? May not our journalism, like our fine clothing, be all the more notoriously bad in the next century, because of this very timeliness for the nineteenth and twentieth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The danger is to be admitted, but, with some reservation, Kipling might answer as did Hermione, &quot;That's true enough; Though 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is certain that the inspiration of the Zeitgeist has sometimes led him astray. His accurate use of technical names ad nauseam appeals to the scientific, no doubt, but is already a little boresome. His rage for the specific leaves some gaudiness, and a touch of smartness even in noble stories, and this is a blot that will not fade with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain tales, &lt;em&gt;Mrs. Bathurst&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Captive&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Comprehension of Private Copper&lt;/em&gt;, to choose three from a late volume, betray a journalistic pursuit of news, or the new, quite gone to seed, and sure to lose flavor with the passing of the interest that gave the stories birth. But these are failures. To get at the best results we must choose more remarkable narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brushwood Boy&lt;/em&gt; (1895) and &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; (1904) are the noblest examples of the modern short story. They are also the most instructive. &lt;em&gt;The Brushwood Boy&lt;/em&gt; is forged out of dreams, good stuff for poetry, but trying metal for narrative. Its idea is so exquisite, so simple, and so nearly absurd that, while a child often thinks of it, nothing but genius could put it into a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A boy wanders through his dreams with someone he calls Annieanlouise, the two finest names he knows. Later he plunges into the cold prose of public-school life, still later enters the army, and goes in for the scientific end. He becomes a healthy young soldier, intensely real, intensely practical, and yet never ceases to meet his Annieanlouise in the dream-country they alone know. When he meets her in the flesh, and finds that she does not recognize the boy who has ridden the Thirty-Mile Ride with her and fled time and again from &quot;Them&quot; to the friendly brushwood-pile, the plot is ready for its climax, and the overtones, which are everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medieval tales of dream-maidens afford no real parallel to this story; they are pure romance, this is psychologic romance. This never would have been written before the nineteenth century. It never could have been so well written without the journalistic instinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For it is not the idea, already used, in a less subtle form, by Du Maurier in &lt;em&gt;Peter Ibbetson&lt;/em&gt;, which is the principal factor of success. It is the vivid realization of this idea by means of striking contrasts, and such aids to belief as an ordnance map of the dreamland, or the many circumstances of contemporary life. Only thus an emotion not otherwise to be caught except by the most elusive poetry, is brought down to earth and comprehended in a story. As narrative, &lt;em&gt;The Brushwood Boy&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most engrossing of stories. As an achievement, it is no less engrossing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One should be ready to rest the whole case for the short story with &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt;. It is the most exquisite and the most touching narrative written in English so far in the twentieth century. If you understand it, and the tale goes too deep into pathos and the mysteries of human nature to be easily comprehended, you understand the most that our short story has accomplished. If you can analyze the means which lead to this perfect result, you have surprised Mr. Kipling at his best, and mastered the secret of an immensely difficult art of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A glad motor-run across the downs, and then a drop through an old forest, brings the motorist unexpectedly to the edge of a lawn adorned with clipped yew. Beyond is a manor-house, raised by the sweetness and dignity of Elizabethan England. A child waves from an upper window, another laughs behind a fountain, and then she appears whom never at any time he calls by name. She is blind. And she asks first if he has seen the children. &quot;Children! Oh, children! &quot; — her yearning call is the motif of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One learns by implication, as one follows the narrative, that the children who have left their toys in the timbered room, with the latch made low for them, who whisk and flutter away, always just seen, just heard, never caught, have come to her only because she loved children so. They are children of the mind then? Not altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is the wonderful part of this story, which is no Hawthornesque allegory, but so true and so real, for all its mysticism, that the tears start again and again in the reading of it. Their reality is that of the fairy people for the middle age, of the music of the written note for the musician. They come, to be seen or heard, only by one whose ears or eyes are opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the opening of the senses through love or through grief which is the idea of the story. The lady of this ancient house loved children, although she had neither borne nor lost. She knew that &quot;they were all that I should ever have,&quot; and she had left the garden gate open, the fire always burning on the hearth, for children would have wished it so. Then dead children had come in answer to her yearning love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;So through the Void the Children ran homeward merrily hand in hand, looking neither to left nor right where the breathless Heavens stood still.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet she had neither borne nor lost. The children, whose voices she hears, though she cannot see their faces, were not hers. He had lost. It was his dead child behind the screen, in the twilight of the great hall, who turned his hand softly in her soft hand and gave the old signal, the kiss in the center of the palm — &quot;as a gift upon which the fingers were, once, expected to close.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he understood. &quot;O, you must bear or lose,&quot; she had said piteously, &quot;There is no other way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he feared that her love would pale beside his memory of the dead. Or that his presence might be as impassible iron to the dead children, who came back because she needed them. Certainly she would be jealous for the one which was his, as for that other who had come for the butler's wife — &quot;Hers! Not for me,&quot; she had said. It was not right that he should possess his dear memory and yet share her experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Neither the harps nor the crowns amused, nor the cherubs' dove-winged races —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Holding hands forlornly the Children wandered beneath the Dome;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Plucking the radiant robes of the passers by, and with pitiful faces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Begging what Princes and Powers refused: — 'Ah, please will you let us go home? '&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lest they should not come home, and home to her, he goes, never to return again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the story; but to tell it so is to miss the beauty of a setting all of one tone, to touch, and no more than touch, upon a pathos so interpenetrative as to seem an effect of the whole, and to blur a meaning too exquisite to be utterly explained. This is enough, however, to show how far the narrative has been carried into emotions none the less intense because they are subtle. The conception is valuable in measure with the love of children. It is inconceivable that it could have been expressed in narrative except by an impressionistic short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, to come down to the technical, it was eminent artistic powers, plus journalism, which made Kipling's success possible. The Zeitgeist pushed him on to that unattempted yet in narrative prose. His strong sense for the value of the real, and his perception of those concrete manifestations which, in so subtle a matter, could be grasped by the reader, these made him able to put the love of children, in its most intimate, most poignant form, into a story. Such achievements are not transitory. They have too much worth and too much beauty to die with the generation for which they have a particular appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;kipling--the-literary-standard-bearer-for-his-generation&quot;&gt;Kipling – The Literary Standard-Bearer for His Generation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kipling sums up the last twenty years in the short story about as adequately as Shakespeare sums up the Elizabethan drama. He best represents the best achievements of his age in this literary form. The swarm of contemporary story-tellers, big and little, are not always, or even usually, influenced directly by his practice. The most excellent among them are only less strongly original in their way than he in his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To appreciate them properly each should have an essay of his own. But their efforts are all comprehensible in the light of Kipling and his predecessors. Each works with his or her own formula but, so far, no one of them has made a further advance in the writing of the short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Hewlett, for instance, constructs a Venetian mosaic, each block of which is compressed from the riches of history or of literature, and colored with a foreign life. He is never coarse or inelegant, as Kipling is so often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He seldom forsakes the charm of literary romance in order to secure an appearance of reality. He seems to be a highly-cultured, highly-imaginative writer, who, except in the use of specific words, is not a very good journalist. &lt;em&gt;The Madonna of the Peach Tree&lt;/em&gt; is a symphony of word-music. It is an example of perfect tone as a means to the end of the impressionistic short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miss Wilkins deals in a local life which is far quieter and more commonplace than India's. Her New England sketches are never sensational, and would fail to be striking were it not for the strength of her situations and the force of her contrasts. Her means are always legitimate; sometimes they are also inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph Conrad is most like Kipling. His &lt;em&gt;Youth&lt;/em&gt; is a splendid example of glorified journalism. So interesting a subject as the eternal fascination of the West by the East is wrought out in a fashion characteristically novel. Plot there is none, but all the apparatus of changing scenes, illuminated by specific description and increasing vividness, is aimed at a single effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, to consider very different work, the narratives of our O. Henry crack like a whip, and are as French in effect as they are American in substance. Here is plenty of journalism and very little Kipling, yet there is nothing to be said in general of his short stories which the critical reader will not discern for himself. His curve has already been plotted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exigencies of a historical treatment strictly limit our appreciations. Contemporary short-story writers are so numerous and so skilful that one feels of a given example as King Harry felt of Percy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;'I haue a hondrith captayns in Ynglonde,' he sayd,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;'As good as euer was he.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their purposes, their general methods, have been approximately defined. This criticism can in no way be supposed to comprehend all that is needful of praise and discrimination, yet, with these contemporaries, one key unlocks the type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Kipling is that key, it is not that he represents the most of his fellow-writers, but the best. In its intensest mood, his short story is an impressionistic rendering of a novel and intricate situation. Towards this goal the best writers in their degree have all been struggling. Henry James, as well as Kipling, and before him, saw the vision, and these two have advanced the art to conquests before unthought of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Henry James is the philosopher who traffics in &quot;the high that proved too high, the heroic for earth too hard.&quot; He is not always interesting, because he is not always easily intelligible. He neglects the imagination sometimes; he often neglects the heart. He is not a good journalist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kipling, on the other hand, is quite as vital, and more interesting. He sees into human nature almost as skilfully as the modern &lt;em&gt;maestro di color che sanno&lt;/em&gt;, and he tells what he sees there with more effectiveness. To the insight of an analyst, and the skill of a storyteller, he adds the perceptions of a poet and the quickening power which, in lesser manifestations, is called the journalistic. In the short story he is the standard-bearer for his generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting experiment of one of our great publishing houses in putting out serially several volumes of short stories &lt;em&gt;(Harper's Portrait Collection of Short Stories. Harper &amp;amp; Brothers: New York.)&lt;/em&gt;, with the hope that a courageous persistence may overcome the popular indifference to such collections when severally administered, suggests some questions as to this eldest form of fiction which I should like to ask the reader's patience with. I do not know that I shall be able to answer them, or that I shall try to do so; the vitality of a question that is answered seems to exhale in the event; it palpitates no longer; curiosity flutters away from the faded flower, which is fit then only to be folded away in the &lt;em&gt;hortus siccus&lt;/em&gt; of accomplished facts. In view of this I may wish merely to state the problems and leave them for the reader's solution, or more amusingly, for his mystification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-i&quot;&gt;Chapter I&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-short-story--alone--in-collections&quot;&gt;The Short Story — Alone &amp;amp; In Collections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most amusing questions concerning the short story is why a form which is singly so attractive that everyone likes to read a short story when he finds it alone is collectively so repellant as it is said to be. Before now I have imagined the case to be somewhat the same as that of a number of pleasant people who are most acceptable as separate householders, but who lose caste and cease to be desirable acquaintances when gathered into a boarding-house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the case is not the same quite, for we see that the short story where it is ranged with others of its species within the covers of a magazine is so welcome that the editor thinks his number the more brilliant the more short story writers he can call about his board, or under the roof of his pension. Here the boarding-house analogy breaks, breaks so signally that I was lately moved to ask a distinguished editor why a book of short stories usually failed and a magazine usually succeeded because of them. He answered gaily that the short stories in most books of them were bad; that where they were good, they went; and he alleged several well-known instances in which books of prime short stories had a great vogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was so handsomely interested in my inquiry that I could not well say I thought some of the short stories which he had boasted in his last number were indifferent good, and yet, as he allowed, had mainly helped sell it. I had in mind many books of short stories of the first excellence which had failed as decidedly as those others had succeeded, for no reason that I could see; possibly there is really no reason in any literary success or failure that can be predicated, or applied in another case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could name these books, if it would serve any purpose, but, in my doubt, I will leave the reader to think of them, for I believe that his indolence or intellectual reluctance is largely to blame for the failure of good books of short stories. He is commonly so averse to any imaginative exertion that he finds it a hardship to respond to that peculiar demand which a book of good short stories makes upon him. He can read one good short story in a magazine with refreshment, and a pleasant sense of excitement, in the sort of spur it gives to his own constructive faculty. But if this is repeated in ten or twenty stories, he becomes fluttered and exhausted by the draft upon his energies; whereas a continuous fiction of the same quantity acts as an agreeable sedative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A condition that the short story tacitly makes with the reader, through its limitations, is that he shall subjectively fill in the details and carry out the scheme which in its small dimensions the story can only suggest; and the greater number of readers find this too much for their feeble powers, while they cannot resist the incitement to attempt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My theory does not wholly account for the fact (no theory wholly accounts for any fact), and I own that the same objections would lie from the reader against a number of short stories in a magazine. But it may be that the effect is not the same in the magazine because of the variety in the authorship, and because it would be impossibly jolting to read all the short stories in a magazine seriatim. On the other hand, the identity of authorship gives a continuity of attraction to the short stories in a book which forms that exhausting strain upon the imagination of the involuntary co-partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-development-of-the-novella&quot;&gt;The Development of the Novella&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, what is the solution as to the form of publication for short stories, since people do not object to them singly but collectively, and not in variety, but in identity of authorship? Are they to be printed only in the magazines, or are they to be collected in volumes combining a variety of authorship?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, I could wish, it might be found feasible to purvey them in some pretty shape where each would appeal singly to the reader and would not exhaust him in the subjective after-work required of him. In this event many short stories now cramped into undue limits by the editorial exigencies of the magazines might expand to greater length and breadth, and without ceasing to be each a short story might not make so heavy a demand upon the subliminal forces of the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any one were to say that all this was a little fantastic, I should not contradict him; but I hope there is some reason in it, if reason can help the short story to greater favor, for it is a form which I have great pleasure in as a reader, and pride in as an American. If we have not excelled all other moderns in it, we have certainly excelled in it; possibly because we are in the period of our literary development which corresponds to that of other peoples when the short story pre-eminently flourished among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when one has said a thing like this it immediately accuses one of loose and inaccurate statement, and requires one to refine upon it, either for one's own peace of conscience or for one's safety from the thoughtful reader. I am not much afraid of that sort of reader, for he is very rare, but I do like to know myself what I mean, if I mean anything in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this instance I am obliged to ask myself whether our literary development can be recognized separately from that of the whole English speaking world. I think it can, though, as I am always saying, American literature is merely a condition of English literature. In some sense every European literature is a condition of some other European literature, yet the impulse in each eventuates, if it does not originate (if I may be permitted the apparent tautology) indigenously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A younger literature will choose, by a sort of natural selection, some things for assimilation from an elder literature, for no more apparent reason than it will reject other things, and it will transform them in the process so that it will give them the effect of indigeneity. The story among the Italians, who called it the novella, and supplied us with the name devoted solely among us to fiction of epical magnitude, refined indefinitely upon the Greek romance, if it derived from that; it retrenched itself in scope, and enlarged itself in the variety of its types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But still these remained types, and they remained types with the French imitators of the Italian novella. It was not till the Spaniards borrowed the form of the novella and transplanted it to their racier soil that it began to bear character, and to fruit in the richness of their picaresque fiction. When the English borrowed it they adapted it, in the metrical tales of Chaucer, to the genius of their nation, which was then both poetical and humorous. Here it was full of character, too, and more and more personality began to enlarge the bounds of the conventional types and to imbue fresh ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in so far as the novella was studied in the Italian sources, the French, Spanish and English literatures were conditions of Italian literature as distinctly, though, of course, not so thoroughly, as American literature is a condition of English literature. Each borrower gave a national cast to the thing borrowed, and that is what has happened with us, in the full measure that our nationality has differenced itself from the English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever truth there is in all this, and I will confess that a good deal of it seems to me hardy conjecture, rather favors my position that we are in some such period of our literary development as those other peoples when the short story flourished among them. Or, if I restrict our claim I may safely claim that they abundantly had the novella when they had not the novel at all, and we now abundantly have the novella, while we have the novel only subordinate and of at least no such quantitative importance as the English, French, Spanish, Norwegians, Russians, and some others of our esteemed contemporaries, not to name the Italians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We surpass the Germans, who, like ourselves, have as distinctly excelled in the modern novella as they have fallen short in the novel. Or, if I may not quite say this, I will make bold to say that I can think of many German novelle that I should like to read again, but scarcely one German novel; and I could honestly say the same of American novelle, though not of American novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-iii&quot;&gt;Chapter III&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-disuse-of-the-novella-as-a-favored-form-of-the-short-story&quot;&gt;The Disuse of the Novella as a Favored Form of the Short Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abeyance, not to say the desuetude, that the novella fell into for several centuries is very curious, and fully as remarkable as the modem rise of the short story. It began to prevail in the dramatic form, for a play is a short story put on the stage; it may have satisfied in that form the early love of it, and it has continued to please in that form; but in its original shape it quite vanished, unless we consider the little studies and sketches and allegories of the &lt;em&gt;Spectator&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tatler&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Idler&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Rambler&lt;/em&gt;, and their imitations on the continent, as guises of the novella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The germ of the modern short story may have survived in these, or in the metrical form of the novella which appeared in Chaucer and never wholly disappeared. With Crabbe the novella became as distinctly the short story as it has become in the hands of Miss Wilkins. But it was not till our time that its great merit as a form was felt, for until our time so great work was never done with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remind myself of Boccaccio, and of the &lt;em&gt;Arabian Nights&lt;/em&gt;, without the wish to hedge from my bold stand. They are all elemental; compared with some finer modern work which deepens inward immeasurably, they are all of their superficial limits. They amuse, but they do not hold the mind, and stamp it with large and profound impressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Occidental cannot judge the literary quality of the Eastern tales; but I will own my suspicion that the perfection of the Italian work is philological rather than artistic, while the web woven by Mr. James or Miss Jewett, by Kielland or Bjornson, by Maupassant, by Palacio Valdes, by Giovanni Verga, by Tourguenief, in one of those little frames seems to me of an exquisite color and texture and of an entire literary preciousness, not only as regards the diction, but as regards those more intangible graces of form, those virtues of truth and reality and those lasting significances which distinguish the masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novella has in fact been carried so far in the short story that it might be asked whether it had not left the novel behind, as to perfection of form; though one might not like to affirm this. Yet there have been but few modern fictions of the novel's dimensions which have the beauty of form many a novella embodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this because it is easier to give form in the small than in the large, or only because it is easier to hide formlessness? It is easier to give form in the novella than in the novel, because the design of less scope can be more definite, and because the persons and facts are fewer, and each can be more carefully treated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand the slightest error in execution shows more in the small than in the large, and a fault of conception is more evident. The novella must be clearly imagined, above all things, for there is no room in it for those felicities of characterization or comment by which the artist of faltering design saves himself in the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-iv&quot;&gt;Chapter IV&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-short-story-as-distinquished-from-the-anecdote&quot;&gt;The Short Story as Distinquished from the Anecdote&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question as to where the short story distinguishes itself from the anecdote is of the same nature as that which concerns the bound set between it and the novel. In both eases the difference of the novella is in the motive, or the origination. The anecdote is too palpably simple and single to be regarded as a novella, though there is now and then a novella like &lt;em&gt;The Father&lt;/em&gt; by Bjornson, which is of the actual brevity of the anecdote, but which, when released in the reader's consciousness, expands to dramatic dimensions impossible to the anecdote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many anecdotes have come down from antiquity, but not, I believe, one short story, at least in prose; and the Italians, if they did not invent the story, gave us something most sensibly distinguishable from the classic anecdote in the novella. The anecdote offers an illustration of character, or records a moment of action; the novella embodies a drama and develops a type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not quite so clear as to when and where a piece of fiction ceases to be a novella and becomes a novel. The frontiers are so vague that one is obliged to recognize a middle species, or rather a middle magnitude, which paradoxically, but necessarily enough, we call the novelette. First we have the short story or novella, then we have the long story or novel, and between these we have the novelette, which is in name a little short story longer than a short story. We may realize them physically if we will adopt the magazine parlance and speak of the novella as a one-number story, of the novel as a serial, and of the novelette as a two-number or a three-number story; if it passes the three-number limit it seems to become a novel. As a two-number or three-number story it is the despair of editors and publishers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interest of so brief a serial will not mount sufficiently to carry strongly over from month to month; when the tale is completed it will not make a book which the trade (inexorable force!) cares to handle. It is therefore still awaiting its authoritative avatar, which it will be some one's prosperity and glory to imagine; for in the novelette are possibilities for fiction as yet scarcely divined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novelette can have almost as perfect form as the novella. In fact the novel has form in the measure that it approaches the novelette; and some of the most symmetrical modern novels are scarcely more than novelettes, like Tourguenief's &lt;em&gt;Dmitri Budine&lt;/em&gt;, or his &lt;em&gt;Smoke&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Spring Floods&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Vicar of Wakefield&lt;/em&gt;,&quot; the father of the modern novel, is scarcely more than a novelette, and I have sometimes fancied, but no doubt vainly, that the ultimated novel might be of the dimensions of &quot;Hamlet.&quot; If anyone should say there was not room in &quot;Hamlet&quot; for the character and incident requisite in a novel I should be ready to answer that there seemed a good deal of both in &quot;Hamlet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no doubt there are other reasons why the novel should not finally be of the length of &quot;Hamlet,&quot; and I must not let my enthusiasm for the novelette carry me too far, or, rather, bring me up too short. I am disposed to dwell upon it, I suppose, because it has not yet shared the favor which the novella and the novel have enjoyed, and because until somebody invents a way for it to the public it cannot prosper like the one-number story or the serial. I should like to say as my last word for it here that I believe there are many novels which, if stripped of their padding, would turn out to have been all along merely novelettes in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not follow, however, that there are many novelle which, if they were duly padded, would be found novelettes. In that dim, subjective region, where the aesthetic origins present themselves almost with the authority of inspirations, there is nothing clearer than the difference between the short story motive and the long story motive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One, if one is in that line of work, feels instinctively just the size and carrying power of the given motive. Or, if the reader prefers a different figure, the mind which the seed has been dropped into from somewhere is mystically aware whether the seed is going to grow up a bush or is going to grow up a tree, if left to itself. Of course, the mind to which the seed is entrusted may play it false, and willfully dwarf the growth, or force it to unnatural dimensions; but the critical observer will easily detect the fact of this treason. Almost in the first germinal impulse the inventive mind forefeels the ultimate difference, and recognizes the essential simplicity or complexity of the motive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a prophetic subdivision into a variety of motives and a multiplication of characters and incidents and situations; or the original motive will be divined indivisible, and there will be a small group of people immediately interested and controlled by a single, or predominant, fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uninspired may contend that this is bosh, and I own that something might be said for their contention, but upon the whole I think it is gospel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right novel is never a congeries of novelle, as might appear to the uninspired. If it indulges even in episodes it loses in reality and vitality. It is one stock from which its various branches put out, and form it a living growth identical throughout. The right novella is never a novel cropped back from the size of a tree to a bush, or the branch of a tree stuck into the ground and made to serve for a bush. It is another species, destined by the agencies at work in the realm of unconsciousness to be brought into being of its own kind, and not of another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-v&quot;&gt;Chapter V&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-novella--a-more-perfect-form-of-the-story&quot;&gt;The Novella — A More Perfect Form of the Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was always its case, but in the process of time the short story, while keeping the natural limits of the primal novella (if ever there was one), has shown almost limitless possibilities within them. It has shown itself capable of imparting the effect of every sort of intention, whether of humor or pathos, of tragedy, or comedy, or broad farce, or delicate irony, of character or action. The thing that first made itself known as a little tale, usually salacious, dealing with conventionalized types and conventionalized incidents, has proved itself possibly the most flexible of all the literary forms in its adaptation to the needs of the mind that wishes to utter itself, inventively or constructively, upon some fresh occasion, or wishes briefly to criticise or represent some phase or fact of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The riches in this shape of fiction are effectively inestimable, if we consider what has been done in the short story, and is still doing everywhere. The good novels may be easily counted, but the good novelle, since Boccaccio began (if it was he that first began) to make them, cannot be computed. In quantity they are inexhaustible, and in quality they are wonderfully satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, why is it that so very, very few of the most satisfactory of that innumerable multitude stays by you, as the country people say, in characterization or action? How hard it is to recall a person or a fact out of any of them, out of the most signally good! We seem to be delightfully nourished as we read, but is it, after all, a full meal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We become of a perfect intimacy and a devoted friendship with the men and women in the short stories, but not apparently of a lasting acquaintance. It is a single meeting we have with them, and though we instantly love or hate them dearly, recurrence and repetition seem necessary to that familiar knowledge in which we hold the personages in a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is here that the novella, so much more perfect in form, shows its irremediable inferiority to the novel, and somehow to the play, to the very farce, which it may quantitatively excel. We can all recall by name many characters out of comedies and farces; but how many characters out of short stories can we recall?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most persons of the drama give themselves away by name for types, mere figments of allegory, and perhaps oblivion is the penalty that the novella pays for the fineness of its characterizations; but perhaps, also, the dramatic form has greater facilities for repetition and so can stamp its persons more indelibly on the imagination than the narrative form in the same small space. The narrative must give to description what the drama trusts to representation; but this cannot account for the superior permanency of the dramatic types in so great measure as we might at first imagine, for they remain as much in mind from reading as from seeing the plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that as the novella becomes more conscious, its persons will become more memorable; but as it is, though we now vividly and with lasting delight remember certain short stories, we scarcely remember by name any of the people in them. I may be risking too much in offering an instance, but who, in even such signal instances as &lt;em&gt;The Revolt of Mother&lt;/em&gt;, by Miss Wilkins, or &lt;em&gt;The Dulham Ladies&lt;/em&gt;, by Miss Jewett, can recall by name the characters that made them delightful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-vi&quot;&gt;Chapter VI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-defect-of-the-novella&quot;&gt;The Defect of the Novella&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defect of the novella which we have been acknowledging seems an essential limitation; but perhaps it is not insuperable; and we may yet have short stories which shall supply the delighted imagination with creations of as much immortality as we can reasonably demand. The structural change would not be greater than the moral or material change which has been wrought in it since it began as a yarn, gross and palpable, which the narrator spun out of the coarsest and often the filthiest stuff, to snare the thick fancy or amuse the lewd leisure of listeners willing as children to have the same persons and the same things over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it has not only varied the persons and things, but it has refined and verified them in the direction of the natural and the supernatural, until it is above all other literary forms the vehicle of reality and spirituality. When one thinks of a bit of Mr. James' psychology in this form, or a bit of Yerga's or Kielland's sociology, or a bit of Miss Jewett's exquisite veracity, one perceives the immense distance which the short story has come on the way to the height it has reached. It serves equally the ideal and the real; that which it is loath to serve is the unreal, so that among the short stories which have recently made reputations for their authors, very few are of that peculiar cast which we have no name for but romanticistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only distinguished modern writer of romanticistic novelle whom I can think of is Mr. Bret Harte, and he is of a period when romanticism was so imperative as to be almost a condition of fiction. I am never so enamored of a cause that I will not admit facts that seem to tell against it, and I will allow that this writer of romamticistic short stories has more than any other supplied us with memorable types and characters. We remember Mr. John Oakhurst by name; we remember &quot;Kentuck&quot; and &quot;Tennessee's Partner,&quot; at least by nickname; and we remember their several qualities. These figures, if we cannot quite consent that they are persons, exist in our memories by force of their creator's imagination, and at the moment I cannot think of any others that do, out of the myriad of American short stories, except Rip Yan Winkle out of Irving's &lt;em&gt;Legend of Sleepy Hollow&lt;/em&gt;, and Marjorie Daw out of Mr. Aldrich's famous little caprice of that title, and Mr. James' Daisy Miller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears to be the fact that those writers who have first distinguished themselves in the novella have seldom written novels of prime order. Mr. Kipling is an eminent example, but Mr. Kipling has yet a long life before him in which to upset any theory about him, and one can only instance him provisionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, one can be much more confident that the best novelle have been written by the greatest novelists, conspicuously Maupassant, Verga, Bjornsen, Mr. Thomas Hardy, Mr. James, Mr. Cable, Tourguenief, Tolstoy, Valdes, not to name others. These have, in fact, all done work so good in this form that one is tempted to call it their best work. It is really not their best, but it is work so good that it ought to have equal acceptance with their novels, if that distinguished editor was right who said that short stories sold well when they were good short stories. That they ought to do so is so evident that a devoted reader of them to whom I was submitting the anomaly the other day, insisted that they did. I could only allege the testimony of publishers and authors to the contrary, and this did not satisfy him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not satisfy me, and I wish that the general reader with whom the fault lies, could be made to say why, if he likes one short story by itself and four short stories in a magazine, he does not like, or will not have, a dozen short stories in a book. This was the baffling question which I began with, and which I find myself forced to end with, after all the light I have thrown upon the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave it where I found it, but perhaps that is a good deal for a critic to do. If I had left it anywhere else the reader might not feel bound to deal with it practically by reading all the books of short stories he could lay hands on, and either divining why he did not enjoy them, or else forever foregoing his prejudice against them because of his pleasure in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">One of the most amusing questions concerning the short story is why a form which is singly so attractive that everyone likes to read a short story when he finds it alone is collectively so repellant as it is said to be. Before now I have imagined the case to be somewhat the same as that of a number of pleasant people who are most acceptable as separate householders, but who lose caste and cease to be desirable acquaintances when gathered into a boarding-house.</summary>

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Bret Harte to separate two literary periods is more convenient than inevitable. Harte was the great advertiser of the short story, and accomplished with it certain remarkable things, but only in a restricted sense did he begin a new era. The years of which we have now to write, the two score in which the American short story has grown from an infant industry to a national avocation, do not date from &lt;em&gt;The Luck of Roaring Camp&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the several well-marked kinds of stories most popular with us first became readily distinguishable in the decade in which that tale was written, or in the years just succeeding. Bret Harte is the figure which closes the struggle to popularize the new short story in America. He is only one of the progenitors of our current short-story fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These forty years in short narrative have closely paralleled the trade in Oriental rugs. In one respect, the short-story market differs from Constantinople. Modern Ghiordez, Kirmanshah, Tabriz worthy the names are not procurable except in the conceit of the sanguine collector, while as good short stories as ever were written are always to be found somewhere in the bales of stock goods. But, in both instances, an enormous demand has caused an enormous production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are to lift a candle of criticism through the multitudinous assemblage of story which has gathered in books, in newspapers, and in magazines, we must adopt some classification. As it happens, the first chapter may be devoted to Americans exclusively, for it is some time before any Englishman comprehends the meaning which Americans had already put upon &quot;short story,&quot; and writes accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, for convenience, and because, in spite of all combinations and cross-breeds, the distinction is roughly apparent, one may divide these American stories of the last third of the century into three groups, with broad margins for strays. Let us say the story of serious situation; the story of surprising and humorous situation, with an unexpected flip at the end to drive home the point; and the story of local color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henry James is the master of the first; Aldrich was our best representative of the second; Harte was much more than a local colorist — so Cable will serve as a point of departure for the third. The story of local color has been the vein most easily and most frequently worked. The tale with a flip at the end has given us our cleverest and perhaps our best liked narratives. But it is from the practice of the narrative of serious situation that our great short stories have come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;henry-james--narrative-conducted-over-uncharted-seas&quot;&gt;Henry James – Narrative Conducted Over Uncharted Seas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. James, in the course of his annotations upon the new edition of his works, remarks that it was a relief to escape from the frail craft of the short story, where he ever felt the danger of running aground. With apologies, if there is to be any running aground in Mr. James's short stories, it is the reader and not Mr. James who is in danger. Never in the ages of fiction has narrative been conducted over uncharted seas with more consummate skill than in the tales now to be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, frail is the last word that a layman would apply to the short stories of Henry James. Even in those &lt;em&gt;Stories Revived&lt;/em&gt; (1885), collected from magazines of the sixties and early seventies, there is a singular robustness about this writer's work. He grasps his situation without fumbling, and with an uncommon grip. He never lets go of it in the course of the tale, and he never fails to make it the point of his story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Hawthorne, no one has so strongly felt and made us feel the challenge of a good situation. Hawthorne falters sometimes, but Mr. James makes no such error. His art is conscious. He knows that he has — not a great moral truth, but a situation, and one can confidently count upon delivery, be the pages never so numerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these latter days, Mr. James has pushed the study of a situation so far that sometimes the short story will no longer contain the results. He has been forced to use the novel, not always successfully, but his relative failure here only emphasizes the unique character of his special talent. Incomparably subtle and complex are the analyses of Mr. James's recent novels, and the situations with which they concern themselves are no less so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very difficulty of these narratives is proof of a depth of insight as well as of a complexity of style. But if the long stories are too difficult, the short stories, although dealing with situations equally complex, are seldom too intricate for pleasurable perusal. Opinions differ as to the readability of &lt;em&gt;The Wings of the Dove&lt;/em&gt;. They are at one for &lt;em&gt;The Turn of the Screw&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;The Real__Thing&lt;/em&gt;. And yet the first of these short stories contains a situation as subtle as man ever thought of, the second, one so superficial as to be hard to grasp at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both, however, Mr. James confined himself to the limitations of a single effect. And his craft in a true sense was frail, for he had to make this effect in order to succeed. He did make it, and wonderfully, with a style full of nuts, all crackable by good teeth, and a development which, for all its intricacies, brings one face to face with the whole story at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His success, in contrast with the obscurity of his later novels, not only proves the value of the impressionistic short story for the depiction of intricate situations. It is also an instance of Mr. James's capability to advance this new variety of narrative in a most interesting direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be necessary to turn to the stories themselves for the application of these general remarks, but we must delay for another of this author's distinguishing characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-beginnings-of-the-realist-movement-in-english-short-stories&quot;&gt;The Beginnings of the Realist Movement in English Short Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To suppose that the short story cannot be excellent realism, advanced realism if you please, is absurd, as the Russians and the French, if no others, have proven. Yet, before the sixties, almost no good short stories in English were markedly realistic. Poe compounded his out of romanticism. Hawthorne struggled for realism, but did not get it, because it was not realism that he most wanted. O'Brien, who gripped at situations, chose sensational ones, and Harte avoided the uncolored life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that your short story can be given specific gravity more easily by a moral, by a philosophic idea, a terror, a blot of local color, by anything rather than the more or less literal transcription of life which we call realism. And this is true — unless you are dealing with situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the problem is different. It is hard to give a short story its requisite point in an account of wash-day at the public laundries, or in a week from the life of a negro schoolboy. But one can work out an interesting situation with a stern avoidance of sensation, and yet with aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. James was perhaps the first writer in English to accomplish this now universal feat. Hawthorne wrote upon situations, and might have carried the short story into realism. But he was a transcendentalism and his struggles to fit the idea with external reality too often resulted only in a cold symbolism. If Emerson had written fiction, the result would probably have been the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henry James, however, is to be interpreted in terms of his brother, the experimental psychologist. He works from without in, and has the inestimable advantage of knowing life before his interpretation of it. His realism, to be sure, is not the realism of the familiar, like that of Mr. Howells. It is more selective, and even appears unreal to those who do not know his monde. It is still less the gutter-sweeping realism of Maupassant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it deals, and dealt from the first, with a life which, if not common, is certainly unvarnished. At its simplest, one gets a study of every-day life on a liner; at its furthest from the simple, there is the horror of &lt;em&gt;The Turn of the Screw&lt;/em&gt;, where supernaturalism, divested of all its romantic trappings, is surrounded by an atmosphere abnormally intellectual, but thoroughly real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerson, the philosopher, thus far has exceeded James, the psychologist, in moral intensity; and in force and beauty Hawthorne outtops Henry James. But it was the latter who first put realism into an impressionistic short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. James's career as a short-story teller began before Bret Harte's, and is still happily flourishing. Yet, in spite of the repeated assertions that the later James has become a new man, an identity of resemblance in all essential details unites the first stories with the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us take for illustration well-marked and well-known narratives, not exceptions from, but intensifications of, this author's usual practices; let us select from the work of a lifetime &lt;em&gt;A__Passionate Pilgrim&lt;/em&gt; (1871), &lt;em&gt;The Madonna of the Future&lt;/em&gt; (1873), &lt;em&gt;The Real Thing&lt;/em&gt; (1893), &lt;em&gt;The Turn__of the Screw&lt;/em&gt; (1898), and a story or two from the volume of 1901.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The passionate pilgrim was an American, sick of the newness of his country. But this American not only was probable heir to an estate and a name in England, also, by some strange freak of atavism, there were reproduced in him the needs and attributes of an English lord of the manor. A passionate pilgrim, infatuated with the life of the English gentleman, he visits the house that might be his, he pines for the environment that should be his, and falls in love with a woman who symbolizes his desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten thousand Americans have felt faintly what he felt passionately, but it needed Mr. James and this short story to crystallize the situation. It was some thirty years later when Kipling duplicated the performance with &lt;em&gt;An Habitation Enforced&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Madonna of the Future&lt;/em&gt; has another of those situations which, once grasped, make sure a wonderful story. Theobald is an American painter, who launches in Florence his cargo of new world optimism. It is not too late, he thinks, to paint a great Madonna. But she must be perfect! And so he drifts through the Florence galleries and the Florence salons until the opening of the story, his chosen model growing old and corrupt) without his seeing, himself growing old and incapable, and his ideal flowering and perfecting beyond all his power of execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is of disillusionment. The Madonna — is of the future. There is no surprise, no sudden climax. When the canvas in the meager studio is seen at last, and seen to be bare, the discovery is the last stone in an arch. The situation emerges as the single impression of the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Real Thing&lt;/em&gt; everyone knows. It is a far less serious attempt, but no less characteristic. The real thing is represented by Major and Mrs. Monarch, English gentlefolk who have lost all but their inability to be anything but the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot required is light. Its point is in its climax, where, with all pathos, the helpless, noble pair ask &quot;to do&quot; for the artist who tells their story, and for the vulgar models who can imitate aristocracy to better purpose than the real thing can present it. A situation not delicate, not even subtle, but tremendously difficult to get into action, and hence the credit due to this narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Turn of the Screw&lt;/em&gt; is the most interesting short story Mr. James has ever written. I say short story, using the word in its contémporary sense, because, though running to 213 pages in large print, it is as completely unified in its impression as a conté by Maupassant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story itself is better described by the phrases of vague horror with which its narrator introduces it than by any analysis, and this difficulty of concise description beautifully indicates the depths to which we have gone with our short story. Two children, angel-children outwardly, have been corrupted by a governess and an infamous groom. Both corrupters are dead, but their influences, nay, their presences, continue in mysterious, disgusting communication with their eager victims. And to fight these influences is but one will, the new governess, the actor and teller of the tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No superstitious glamor enters, no romantic grimness. There is just a conflict of wills with a sick disgust let in where Poe would have given us horror. And all is controlled by no single emotion, but rather by an intellectual desire to grasp the situation and to see it in horrid clearness. Once this is done, once the children have confessed, the story ends abruptly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single example of such narrative is enough — but it is a satisfaction that it has been accomplished so perfectly. Is it any wonder, with a mind busy over such formulas, that when Mr. James drew up his anchor, and sailed forth on the unrestricted seas of the novel, even the most vigorous were sometimes buffeted back as they followed him!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, compare the latest stories, such tales as &lt;em&gt;The Great Good Place&lt;/em&gt;, whose kernel, heaven knows, is sufficiently enshelled, with those that went before. It is the same art, and often the same triumph. A possible but difficult situation is flooded with a daylight which ranges, according to the success, from murky to sun-clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusions are evident. With Mr. James and his short story, English fiction pushed into fields hitherto unoccupied, if, indeed, existing. The subtler relations and interrelations of possible life, the just graspable situations developing in especial circumstances in this life, all the nuances encountered daily by people of developed sensibilities in our civilization — these he taught us to put into stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the seventies no such work had been done by Englishmen, except in poetry, or with the novel, a tool that could not carve minutely. Nowadays, his successors at the task, on both sides of the water, are legion. None so poor as not to take a hand at psychological analysis, but in his own field no one equals the master. Mrs. Wharton is the best of his followers. Yet even her tales lack the force, the clear perception, the last cunning which marks the work of this pioneer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faults, of course, are to be found. We are by no means prepared to exalt Mr. James to the place of arch story-teller. His monde is too restricted. It is a demimonde, to twist the phrase. It is a world of beings measured from the brain up. Only the intellectual enter these stories, except as foils, and a certain quality, called in its vulgar manifestations &quot;heart interest,&quot; is usually lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, even in his short stories, Mr. James is unduly diffuse in his pursuit of the intricacies of a situation, and therefore unduly elliptical and obscure. Neither of these objections should weigh heavily. The first is a definition, not a condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who criticises Sargent for not painting like Sir Joshua Reynolds? The second is a heavier charge. To be sure the fault is a defect of Mr. James's virtues. He is less guilty than Browning and scarcely more chargeable than Meredith. His experiments in psychology are carried to such advanced stages that we must admire the skill that makes them reasonably intelligible, even when he fails to reduce his inquiry to the &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; of plain language. Yet it is just that feat which ought to be accomplished. James fails sometimes; fails oftenest, it seems, when he cuts loose from the short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when the bugbear Mr. James has crumbled, we will better appreciate the real author. He has rendered an inestimable service, not merely to those his brother might call the tough in intellect, but also to everyone who dimly sees that life is very complex, and wishes to know a little more of its subtleties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-amusing-anecdote--the-yankee-yarn-precursors-of-the-american-short-story&quot;&gt;The Amusing Anecdote &amp;amp; the Yankee Yarn: Precursors of the American Short Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next variety of short story came to its prime a little later, but flourished and flourishes far more abundantly. It is the kind which comes nearest to being anecdotal; the story of light and surprising situation whose point is revealed by a twist of the plot at the very end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his essay on the short story, Bret Harte remarked that the amusing anecdote was a characteristic American product. The fact is notorious. But, as he also observed, the mid-century, when the American yarn became famous, made small literary capital from it. There was, of course, Mark Twain's triumph, &lt;em&gt;The Jumping Frog of Calaveras County&lt;/em&gt;, and there were such narratives as Hale's &lt;em&gt;My Double and How He Undid Me&lt;/em&gt;, but very seldom before the seventies did American &quot;good stories&quot; of the novella type get form and permanency in literature!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that from this Yankee yarn were bred the later short stories which depend for their success upon an amusing situation suddenly revealed by a surprising twist at the end, is to say a good deal. Nevertheless, this familiar variety, as it appears in our magazines, is certainly a product of much the same sense of the incongruous. There is form in these short stories, something never possessed by the yarn. That is because they are short stories, not yarns — but the anecdotal character remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Bailey Aldrich's &lt;em&gt;Marjorie Daw&lt;/em&gt; (1873), a story as delightful as its name, is an example. &lt;em&gt;Marjorie Daw&lt;/em&gt; is a practical joke, on the hero and on the reader. But the flavor is not all in the discomfiture of the hero; nor in the bouleversement at the end, for we are not even told of that scene. It is most to be found in what the American enjoys, the humor of an absurd situation, the humor of incongruity. The hero had been taken in, and was suddenly discovered in a delightful absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In American fiction of this period, Aldrich, Frank R. Stockton, and H. C. Bunner are the masters of this short story. Mr. Aldrich was a stylist who infused his personality into tales of trivialities and made them inexpressibly delightful. If Marjorie Daw was his best effort, there are many others scarcely inferior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One does not think of structure, for the thing is done too easily and too gracefully. Humor and pathos come without forcing. The story flows as whimsy dictates, and never fails of its point, nor blurs the outlines of the situation. Aldrich was the first American to duplicate successfully the French conté. Perhaps he caught the graceful manner from Daudet's &lt;em&gt;Lettres de mon Moulin&lt;/em&gt;; for, certainly, his stories are very French. But they are French only in form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any American humorist for these hundred years would have written &lt;em&gt;Marjorie Daw&lt;/em&gt; and relished the writing if he had known how to expand the situation into a real story. No Englishman did such work. No Englishman does yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Stockton was professional amuser to very many generations of children. His yarns ran to the quaint; griffins were his specialty, and wonderful fairy-book happenings that were humorous, too, in the most unprecedented fashion. I mention him here because, all through the eighties, his work was so popular in America, and so very characteristic of the American short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every tale, for big or little people, has a twist at the end of it. And the biggest twist, what might be called the typical specimen of flips, came at the end &lt;em&gt;of The Lady, or the Tiger?&lt;/em&gt; (1882), a story that probably supplied as much dinner conversation as any other of the century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stockton is more whimsical than Aldrich; he is less polished. He is more German than French, if I may be allowed these terms without implying an imitation by either. But the American humor and the short-story form are always in evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H. C. Bunner died young; and while he lived was continuously a newspaper man. Save for these accidents, he might have been our best fabricator of the anecdotal story. His genius is reincarnated, some think, in our own O. Henry, who is certainly guilty of the one fault to be charged against his predecessor. Bunner was absolute master of the very short story with a very striking conclusion. There is, one sees, even a short-short story!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, no writer in English, but only Maupassant, exceeded him. In subject, he was thoroughly American. The humorous attracted him. He could make a good story from a misapprehension in respect to the sex of a dog. Aldrich struck no deeper than he did, and lacked the rare power of perfect focus, combined with perfect restraint, by which Bunner, like Maupassant, could make six pages tell a story as complete as &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;. But Aldrich possessed what the rhetoricians call elegance —  not grace alone, nor lightness of touch alone, nor dignity alone, but all. Bunner's &lt;em&gt;Short Sixes&lt;/em&gt; (1891), his &lt;em&gt;Love in Old Cloathes&lt;/em&gt; (1896) contain some of the best American short stories. They lack only a perfect style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This anecdotal art, as exemplified in these few selections, is very distinctively American, and, next to American, French. It is worth analyzing because it is exhibited nowhere more perfectly than in the short story, and because, by means of our short stories, it has been partly responsible for the English conception of the American people. True, it has produced much trivial literature, just as the American habit of &quot;swapping yarns&quot; has been responsible for terrible boredom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in either case, even when a poor thing, the custom is our own. I do not know what proportion of magazine stories nowadays are flat because the writer thinks he must be surprisingly humorous at the end. Yet, better a thousand miscarriages than that we should miss a single &lt;em&gt;Jumping Frog of Calaveras County&lt;/em&gt;, or discourage another &lt;em&gt;Marjorie Daw&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-local-color-story--the-narrative-whose-setting-is-distinctly-of-one-locality&quot;&gt;The Local-Color Story – The Narrative Whose Setting Is Distinctly of One Locality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To call the third group of short narratives in this period local-color stories is a little deceptive, for among the short stories usually so named are many palpably anecdotal, and more where a serious situation makes its impression upon the reader. Yet, merely for a convenient division, the name will serve. By a local-color story we mean more than a narrative whose setting is distinctly of one locality, for this would apply to the Italian stories of the Elizabethans, the periodical narratives of London in the eighteenth century, or Hawthorne's New England tales. We mean, rather, a story where the setting is quite as important as the plot; a story to which a strong factitious interest is lent by the local peculiarities of place and action, and by the racial peculiarities of the actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say when such narratives began is to court disaster. Not so uncertain is the time when they became most popular with English and American readers, to wit, the latter part of the nineteenth century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not hard to understand why local color has played such a part in the short story of this period. The technique invented by Poe is thoroughly adapted to catch and record the superficies of life, and particularly idiosyncrasies of habit, and distinctive qualities of scene. Furthermore, since brevity is essential for good description, the much in little of the nineteenth century short story provides the easiest of means for getting observation into readable form. Again, the rising popularity of the short story has been paralleled quite exactly by the growth of interest in special peoples and places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bret Harte did not begin the short story of local color, but he assuredly made the first great popular success which was due in any large part to a vivid description of a given locality. The story of local color, as we read it commonly today, is usually less virile and more pictorial than his. It more closely resembles a narrative type of which the tales in George W. Cable's &lt;em&gt;Old__Creole Days&lt;/em&gt; (1879-83) were, perhaps, the earliest successful examples. Mr. Cable's strong point is not the short story, nor any story structurally considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regard his work as a series of sketches and then its value comes out. Plots are only conveniences for him, ways upon which his sympathetic knowledge of the Creoles may be launched into the world of books. The best thing he ever wrote is not a novel, nor a short story, but Chapters X. and XI. in his pastoral, &lt;em&gt;Grande Pointe&lt;/em&gt;, which treat of the spelling-bee of schoolmaster Bonaventure. Yet the idea of the short story was of some value to him. It was a situation which he usually worked with, and he rounded off his tale with the climactic twist which either reveals the secret of the plot, or settles the narrative with some other definite conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple situations were his ware, and usually those which would flow from the peculiarities of his own Southern people. The horror of an admixture of white blood and black is a basis for many; the contrast between Creole and Yankee serves for even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the descriptive element, however, which is most valuable in Cable's works: such local color as arises from the unforgettable characterizations of Mme. Delphine, of Jean-ah Poquelin, of &lt;em&gt;'Tite Poulette&lt;/em&gt;; the pictures of a semi-tropical life; and the atmosphere of a vanishing civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next in value is the tender sentiment proper to, and worthy of, such descriptions. Abstract this and the local color from the stories and what have you left? Not the types of universal human nature which remain when California drops from Harte's stories, or the Dutch Hudson from Irving's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there is nothing highly valuable in these tales but local color and sentiment. The operation, fortunately, is unnecessary. Yet the theoretical result is instructive, for it defines, in some degree, this variety of the contemporary short story. Rightly or wrongly, our writers have been inclined to make local color the cargo as well as the ballast of their crafts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be too much to say that Cable established the school. He marks, however, the approximate beginning of a long and notable series of stories, by which every nook and corner sheltering a picturesque civilization has been exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has it been worthwhile? Immensely so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it the highest form of short story? Certainly not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Elizabethans sacrificed their short story to Euphuism, making of a good plot a hollow absurdity. Some of our collections of rare dialects may one day seem as empty. But it is not necessary to judge by exaggerations. If the service rendered to art by the local color story has not always been of the highest, the service to curiosity, and the broadening of human sympathies, has been immense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, furthermore, some of the noblest tales in the language have sprung from studies of racial peculiarities, where the artist, in pursuit of traits and customs, has ended by laying bare universal human nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such narratives have been written only when the story and not the setting has been preeminent —  but the best are to be found after, not before, the great local color enthusiasm of the latter nineteenth century.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">The use of Bret Harte to separate two literary periods is more convenient than inevitable. Harte was the great advertiser of the short story, and accomplished with it certain remarkable things, but only in a restricted sense did he begin a new era. The years of which we have now to write, the two score in which the American short story has grown from an infant industry to a national avocation, do not date from The Luck of Roaring Camp.</summary>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should not have affixed so comprehensive a title to these few remarks, necessarily wanting in any completeness, upon a subject the full consideration of which would carry us far, did I not seem to discover a pretext for my temerity in the interesting pamphlet lately published under this name by Mr. Walter Besant. Mr. Besant's lecture at the Royal Institution — the original form of his pamphlet— appears to indicate that many persons are interested in the art of fiction, and are not indifferent to such remarks as those who practise it may attempt to make about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am therefore anxious not to lose the benefit of this favorable association, and to edge in a few words under cover of the attention which Mr. Besant is sure to have excited. There is something very encouraging in his having put into form certain of his ideas on the mystery of story-telling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-i&quot;&gt;Chapter I&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;fiction-as-art&quot;&gt;Fiction As Art&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a proof of life and curiosity — curiosity on the part of the brotherhood of novelists, as well as on the part of their readers. Only a short time ago it might have been supposed that the English novel was not what the French call &lt;em&gt;discrutable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had no air of having a theory, a conviction, a consciousness of itself behind it — of being the expression of an artistic faith, the result of choice and comparison. I do not say it was necessarily the worse for that; it would take much more courage than I possess to intimate that the form of the novel, as Dickens and Thackeray (for instance) saw it, had any taint of incompleteness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was, however, &lt;em&gt;naif&lt;/em&gt; (if I may help myself out with another French word); and, evidently, if it is destined to suffer in any way for having lost its naïveté, it has now an idea of making sure of the corresponding advantages. During the period I have alluded to there was a comfortable, good-humored feeling abroad that a novel is a novel, as a pudding is a pudding, and that this was the end of it. But within a year or two, for some reason or other, there have been signs of returning animation — the era of discussion would appear to have been to a certain extent opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Art lives upon discussion, upon experiment, upon curiosity, upon variety of attempt, upon the exchange of views and the comparison of standpoints; and there is a presumption that those times when no one has anything particular to say about it, and has no reason to give for practice or preference, though they may be times of genius, are not times of development, are times, possibly even, a little of dulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The successful application of any art is a delightful spectacle, but the theory, too, is interesting; and though there is a great deal of the latter without the former, I suspect there has never been a genuine success that has not had a latent core of conviction. Discussion, suggestion, formulation, these things are fertilizing when they are frank and sincere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Besant has set an excellent example in saying what he thinks, for his part, about the way in which fiction should be written, as well as about the way in which it should be published; for his view of the &quot;art,&quot; carried on into an appendix, covers that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other laborers in the same field will doubtless take up the argument, they will give it the light of their experience, and the effect will surely be to make our interest in the novel a little more what it had for some time threatened to fail to be — a serious, active, inquiring interest, under protection of which this delightful study may, in moments of confidence, venture to say a little more what it thinks of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must take itself seriously for the public to take it so. The old superstition about fiction being &quot;wicked&quot; has doubtless died out in England; but the spirit of it lingers in a certain oblique regard directed toward any story which does not more or less admit that it is only a joke. Even the most jocular novel feels in some degree the weight of the proscription that was formerly directed against literary levity; the jocularity does not always succeed in passing for gravity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still expected, though perhaps people are ashamed to say it, that a production which is after all only a &quot;make believe&quot; (for what else is a &quot;story?&quot;) shall be in some degree apologetic — shall renounce the pretension of attempting really to compete with life. This, of course, any sensible wide-awake story declines to do; for it quickly perceives that the tolerance granted to it on such a condition is only an attempt to stifle it, disguised in the form of generosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old Evangelical hostility to the novel, which was as explicit as it was narrow, and which regarded it as little less favorable to our immortal part than a stage-play, was in reality far less insulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason for the existence of a novel is that it does compete with life. When it ceases to compete as the canvas of the painter competes, it will have arrived at a very strange pass. It is not expected of the picture that it will make itself humble in order to be forgiven; and the analogy between the art of the painter and the art of the novelist is, so far as I am able to see, complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their inspiration is the same, their process (allowing for the different quality of the vehicle) is the same, their success is the same. They may learn from each other, they may explain and sustain each other. Their cause is the same, and the honor of one is the honor of another. Peculiarities of manner, of execution, that correspond on either side, exist in each of them and contribute to their development. The Mahometans think a picture an unholy thing, but it is a long time since any Christian did, and it is therefore the more odd that in the Christian mind the traces (dissimulated though they may be) of a suspicion of the sister art should linger to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only effectual way to lay it to rest is to emphasize the analogy to which I just alluded — to insist on the fact that, as the picture is reality, so the novel is history. That is the only general description (which does it justice) that we may give of the novel. But history also is allowed to compete with life, as I say; it is not, any more than painting, expected to apologize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject-matter of fiction is stored up likewise in documents and records, and if it will not give itself away, as they say in California, it must speak with assurance, with the tone of the historian. Certain accomplished novelists have a habit of giving themselves away which must often bring tears to the eyes of people who take their fiction seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lately struck, in reading over many pages of Anthony Trollope, with his want of discretion in this particular. In a digression, a parenthesis or an aside, he concedes to the reader that he and this trusting friend are only &quot;making believe.&quot; He admits that the events he narrates have not really happened, and that he can give his narrative any turn the reader may like best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a betrayal of a sacred office seems to me, I confess, a terrible crime; it is what I mean by the attitude ofapology, and it shocks me every whit as much in Trollope as it would have shocked me in Gibbon or Macaulay. It implies that the novelist is less occupied in looking for the truth than the historian, and in doing so it deprives him at a stroke of all his standing-room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To represent and illustrate the past, the actions of men, is the task of either writer, and the only difference that I can see is, in proportion as he succeeds, to the honor of the novelist, consisting as it does in his having more difficulty in collecting his evidence, which is so far from being purely literary. It seems to me to give him a great character, the fact that he has at once so much in common with the philosopher and the painter; this double analogy is a magnificent heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is of all this evidently that Mr. Besant is full when he insists upon the fact that fiction is one of the fine arts, deserving in its turn of all the honors and emoluments that have hitherto been reserved for the successful profession of music, poetry, painting, architecture. It is impossible to insist too much on so important a truth, and the place that Mr. Besant demands for the work of the novelist may be represented, a trifle less abstractly, by saying that he demands not only that it shall be reputed artistic, but that it shall be reputed very artistic indeed. It is excellent that he should have struck this note, for his doing so indicates that there was need of it, that his proposition may be to many people a novelty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One rubs one's eyes at the thought; but the rest of Mr. Besant's essay confirms the revelation. I suspect, in truth, that it would be possible to confirm it still further, and that one would not be far wrong in saying that in addition to the people to whom it has never occurred that a novel ought to be artistic, there are a great many others who, if this principle were urged upon them, would be filled with an indefinable mistrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They would find it difficult to explain their repugnance, but it would operate strongly to put them on their guard. &quot;Art,&quot; in our Protestant communities, where so many things have got so strangely twisted about, is supposed, in certain circles, to have some vaguely injurious effect upon those who make it an important consideration, who let it weigh in the balance. It is assumed to be opposed in some mysterious manner to morality, to amusement, to instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it is embodied in the work of the painter (the sculptor is another affair!) you know what it is; it stands there before you, in the honesty of pink and green and a gilt frame; you can see the worst of it at a glance, and you can be on your guard. But when it is introduced into literature it becomes more insidious — there is danger of its hurting you before you know it. Literature should be either instructive or amusing, and there is in many minds an impression that these artistic pre-occupations, the search for form, contribute to neither end, interfere, indeed, with both. They are too frivolous to be edifying, andtoo serious to be diverting; and they are, moreover, priggish and paradoxical and superfluous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, I think, represents the manner in which the latent thought of many people who read novels as an exercise in skipping would explain itself if it were to become articulate. They would argue, of course, that a novel ought to be &quot;good,&quot; but they would interpret this term in a fashion of their own, which, indeed, would vary considerably from one critic to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would say that being good means representing virtuous and aspiring characters, placed in prominent positions; another would say that it depends for a &quot;happy ending&quot; on a distribution at the last of prizes, pensions, husbands, wives, babies, millions, appended paragraphs, and cheerful remarks. Another still would say that it means being full of incident and movement, so that we shall wish to jump ahead, to see who was the mysterious stranger, and if the stolen will was ever found, and shall not be distracted from this pleasure by any tiresome analysis or &quot;description.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they would all agree that the &quot;artistic&quot; idea would spoil some of their fun. One would hold it accountable for all the description, another would see it revealed in the absence of sympathy. Its hostility to a happy ending would be evident, and it might even, in some cases, render any ending at all impossible. The &quot;ending&quot; of a novel is, for many persons, like that of a good dinner, a course of dessert and ices, and the artist in fiction is regarded as a sort of meddle-some doctor who forbids agreeable aftertastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore true that this conception of Mr. Besant's, of the novel as a superior form, encounters not only a negative but a positive indifference. It matters little that, as a work of art, it should really be as little or as much concerned to supply happy endings, sympathetic characters, and an objective tone, as if it were a work of mechanics; the association of ideas, however incongruous, might easily be too much for it if an eloquent voice were not sometimes raised to call attention to the fact that it is at once as free and as serious a branch of literature as any other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, this might sometimes be doubted in presence of the enormous number of works of fiction that appeal to the credulity of our generation, for it might easily seem that there could be no great substance in a commodity so quickly and easily produced. It must be admitted that good novels are somewhat compromised by bad ones, and that the field at large suffers discredit from overcrowding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think, however, that this injury is only superficial, and that the superabundance of written fiction proves nothing against the principle itself. It has been vulgarized, like all other kinds of literature, like everything else to-day, and it has proved more than some kinds accessible to vulgarization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is as much difference as there ever was between a good novel and a bad one; the bad is swept, with all the daubed canvases and spoiled marble, intosome unvisited limbo or infinite rubbish-yard, beneath the back-windows of the world, and the good subsists and emits its light and stimulates our desire for perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I shall take the liberty of making but a single criticism of Mr. Besant, whose tone is so full of the love of his art, I may as well have done with it at once. He seems to me to mistake in attempting to say so definitely beforehand what sort of an affair the good novel will be. To indicate the danger of such an error as that has been the purpose of these few pages; to suggest that certain traditions on the subject, applied a priori, have already had much to answer for, and that the good health of an art which undertakes so immediately to reproduce life must demand that it be perfectly free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It lives upon exercise, and the very meaning of exercise is freedom. The only obligation to which in advance we may hold a novel without incurring the accusation of being arbitrary, is that it be interesting. That general responsibility rests upon it, but it is the only one I can think of. The ways in which it is at liberty to accomplish this result (of interesting us) strike me as innumerable and such as can only suffer from being marked out, or fenced in, by prescription. They are as various as the temperament of man, and they are successful in proportion as they reveal a particular mind, different from others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A novel is in its broadest definition a personal impression of life; that, to begin with, constitutes its value, which is greater or less according to the intensity of the impression. But there will be no intensity at all, and therefore no value, unless there is freedom to feel and say. The tracing of a line to be followed, of a tone to be taken, of a form to be filled out, is a limitation of that freedom and a suppression of the very thing that we are most curious about. The form, it seems to me, is to be appreciated after the fact; then the author's choice has been made, his standard has been indicated; then we can follow lines and directions and compare tones. Then, in a word, we can enjoy one of the most charming of pleasures, we can estimate quality, we can apply the test of execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The execution belongs to the author alone; it is what is most personal to him, and we measure him by that. The advantage, the luxury, as well as the torment and responsibility, of the novelist, is that there is no limit to what he may attempt as an executant — no limit to his possible experiments, efforts, discoveries, successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is especially that he works, step by step, like his brother of the brush, of whom we may always say that he has painted his picture in a manner best known to himself. His manner is his secret, not necessarily a deliberate one. He cannot disclose it, as a general thing, if he would; he would be at a loss to teach it to others. I say this with a due recollection of having insisted on the community of method of the artist who paints a picture and the artist who writes a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The painter is able to teach the rudiments of his practice, and it is possible,from the study of good work (granted the aptitude), both to learn how to paint and to learn how to write. Yet it remains true, without injury to the rapprochement that the literary artist would be obliged to say to his pupil much more than the other, &quot;Ah, well, you must do it as you can!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a question of degree, a matter of delicacy. If there are exact sciences there are also exact arts, and the grammar of painting is so much more definite that it makes the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-ii&quot;&gt;Chapter II&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-laws-of-fiction&quot;&gt;The Laws of Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ought to add, however, that if Mr. Besant says at the beginning of his essay that the &quot;laws of fiction may be laid down and taught with as much precision and exactness as the laws of harmony, perspective, and proportion,&quot; he mitigates what might appear to be an over-statement by applying his remark to &quot;general&quot; laws, and by expressing most of these rules in a manner with which it would certainly be unaccommodating to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That the novelist must write from his experience, that his &quot;characters must be real and such as might be met with in actual life; &quot; that &quot;a young lady brought up in a quiet country village should avoid descriptions of garrison life,&quot; and  &quot;a writer whose friends and personal experiences belong to the lower middle-class should carefully avoid introducing his characters into Society;&quot; that one should enter one's notes in a commonplace book; that one's figures should be clear in outline; that making them clear by some trick of speech or of carriage is a bad method, and &quot;describing them at length&quot; is a worse one; that English Fiction should have a &quot;conscious moral purpose; &quot; that &quot;it is almost impossible to estimate too highly the value of careful workmanship — that is, of style;&quot; that &quot;the most important point of all is the story,&quot; that &quot; the story is everything &quot;—these are principles with most of which it is surely impossible not to sympathize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That remark about the lower middle-class writer and his knowing his place is perhaps rather chilling; but for the rest, I should find it difficult to dissent from any one of these recommendations. At the same time I should find it difficult positively to assent to them, with the exception, perhaps, of the injunction as to entering one's notes in a common place book. They scarcely seem to me to have the quality that Mr. Besant attributes to the rules of the novelist — the &quot;precision and exactness&quot; of &quot;the laws of harmony, perspective, and proportion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are suggestive, they are even inspiring, but they are not exact, though they are doubtless as much so as the case admits of; which is a proof of that liberty of interpretation for which I just contended. For the value of these different injunctions — so beautiful and so vague — is wholly in the meaning one attaches to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characters, the situation, which strike one as real, will be those that touch and interest one most, but the measure of reality is very difficult to fix. The reality of Don Quixote or Mr. Micawber is a very delicate shade; it is a reality so colored by the author's vision that, vivid as it may be, one would hesitate to propose it as a model; one would expose one's self to some very embarrassing questions on the part of a pupil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that you will not write a good novel unless you possess the sense of reality; but it will be difficult to give you a recipe for calling that sense into being. Humanity is immense, and reality has a myriad forms; the most one can affirm is that some of the flowers of fiction have the odor of it, and others have not; as for telling you in advance how your nosegay should be composed, that is another affair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is equally excellent and inconclusive to say that one must write from experience; to our supposititious aspirant such a declaration might savor of mockery. What kind of experience is intended, and where does it begin and end?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experience is never limited, and it is never complete; it is an immense sensibility, a kind of huge spider-web, of the finest silken threads, suspended in the chamber of consciousness and catching every air-borne particle in its tissue. It is the very atmosphere of the mind; and when the mind is 'imaginative — much more when it happens to be that of a man of genius;' it takes to itself the faintest hints of life, it converts the very pulses of the air into revelations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young lady living in a village has only to be a damsel upon whom nothing is lost to make it quite unfair (as it seems to me) to declare to her that she shall have nothing to say about the military. Greater miracles have been seen than that, imagination assisting, she should speak the truth about some of these gentlemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember an English novelist, a woman of genius, telling me that she was much commended for the impression she had managed to give in one of her tales of the nature and way of life of the French Protestant youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had been asked where she learned so much about this recondite being, she had been congratulated on her peculiar opportunities. These opportunities consisted in her having once, in Paris, as she ascended a staircase, passed an open door where, in the household of a pasteur, some of the young Protestants were seated at table round a finished meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The glimpse made a picture; it lasted only a moment, but that moment was experience. She had got her impression, and she evolved her type. She knew what youth was, and what Protestantism; she also had the advantage of having seen what it was to be French; so that she converted these ideas into a concrete image, and produced a reality. Above all, however, she was blessed with the faculty which when you give it an inch takes an ell, and which for the artist is a much greater source of strength than any accident of residence or of place in the social scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power to guess the unseen from the seen, to trace the implication of things, to judge the whole piece by the pattern, the condition of feeling life, in general, so completely that you are well on your way to knowing any particular corner of it — this cluster of gifts may almost be said to constituteexperience, and they occur in country and in town, and in the most differing stages of education. If experience consists of impressions, it may be said that impressions are experience, just as (have we not seen it?) they are the very air we breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if I should certainly say to a novice, &quot;Write from experience, and experience only,&quot; I should feel that this was a rather tantalizing monition if I were not careful immediately to add, &quot;Try to be one of the people on whom nothing is lost!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-truth-of-detail-in-fiction&quot;&gt;The Truth of Detail in Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am far from intending by this to minimize the importance of exactness — of truth of detail. One can speak best from one's own taste, and I may therefore venture to say that the air of reality (solidity of specification) seems to me to be the supreme virtue of a novel — the merit in which all its other merits (including that conscious moral purpose of which Mr. Besant speaks) helplessly and submissively depend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it be not there, they are all as nothing, and if these be there they owe their effect to the success with which the author has produced the illusion of life. The cultivation of this success, the study of this exquisite process, form, to my taste, the beginning and the end of the art of the novelist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are his inspiration, his despair, his reward, his torment, his delight. It is here, in very truth, that he competes with life; it is here that he competes with his brother, the painter, in his attempt to render the look of things, the look that conveys their meaning, to catch the color, the relief, the expression, the surface, the substance of the human spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in regard to this that Mr. Besant is well inspired when he bids him take notes. He cannot possibly take too many, he cannot possibly take enough. All life solicits him, and to &quot;render'' the simplest surface, to produce the most momentary illusion, is a very complicated business. His case would be easier, and the rule would be more exact, if Mr. Besant had been able to tell him what notes to take. But this I fear he can never learn in any handbook; it is the business of his life. He has to take a great many in order to select a few, he has to work them up as he can, and even the guides and philosophers who might have most to say to him must leave him alone when it comes to the application of precepts, as we leave the painter in communion with his palette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That his characters &quot;must be clear in outline,&quot; as Mr. Besant says — he feels that down to his boots; but how he shall make them so is a secret between his good angel and himself. It would be absurdly simple if he could be taught that a great deal of &quot;description&quot; would make them so, or that, on the contrary, the absence of description and the cultivation of dialogue, or the absence of dialogue and the multiplication of &quot;incident,&quot; would rescue him from his difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing, for instance, is more possible than that he be of a turn of mind for which this odd, literal opposition of description and dialogue, incident and description, has little meaningand light. People often talk of these things as if they had a kind of internecine distinctness, instead of melting into each other at every breath and being intimately associated parts of one general effort of expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot imagine composition existing in a series of blocks, nor conceive, in any novel worth discussing at all, of a passage of description that is not in its intention narrative, a passage of dialogue that is not in its intention descriptive, a touch of truth of any sort that does not partake of the nature of incident, and an incident that derives its interest from any other source than the general and only source of the success of a work of art — that of being illustrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A novel is a living thing, all one and continuous, like every other organism, and in proportion as it lives will it be found, I think, that in each of the parts there is something of each of the other parts. The critic who over the close texture of a finished work will pretend to trace a geography of items will mark some frontiers as artificial, I fear, as any that have been known to history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an old-fashioned distinction between the novel of character and the novel of incident, which must have cost many a smile to the intending romancer who was keen about his work. It appears to me as little to the point as the equally celebrated distinction between the novel and the romance — to answer as little to any reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are bad novels and good novels, as there are bad pictures and good pictures; but that is the only distinctionin which I see any meaning, and I can as little imagine speaking of a novel of character as I can imagine speaking of a picture of character. When one says picture, one says of character; when one says novel, one says of incident, and the terms may be transposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is character but the determination of incident? What is incident but the illustration of character? What is a picture or a novel that is not of character? What else do we seek in it and find in it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an incident for a woman to stand up with her hand resting on a table and look out at you in a certain way; or, if it be not an incident, I think it will be hard to say what it is. At the same time, it is an expression of character. If you say you don't see it (character in that — allons donc!) this is exactly what the artist, who has reasons of his own for thinking he does see it, undertakes to show you. When a young man makes up his mind that he has not faith enough, after all, to enter the church, as he intended, that is an incident, though you may not hurry to the end of the chapter to see whether perhaps he doesn't change once more. I do not say that these are extraordinary or startling incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not pretend to estimate the degree of interest proceeding from them, for this will depend upon the skill of the painter. It sounds almost puerile to say that some incidents are intrinsically much more important than others, and I need not take this precaution, after having professed my sympathy for the major ones, in remarking that the only classification of the novel that I can understand is into the interesting and the uninteresting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-iv&quot;&gt;Chapter IV&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;critics--the-discussion-of-the-literary-value-of-fiction&quot;&gt;Critics &amp;amp; The Discussion of the Literary Value of Fiction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novel and the romance, the novel of incident and that of character, — these separations appear to me to have been made by critics and readers for their own convenience, and to help them out of some of their difficulties, but to have little reality or interest for the producer, from whose point of view it is, of course, that we are attempting to consider the art of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case is the same with another shadowy category, which Mr. Besant apparently is disposed to set up — that of the &quot;modern English novel;&quot; unless, indeed, it be that in this matter he has fallen into an accidental confusion of standpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not quite clear whether he intends the remarks in which he alludes to it to be didactic or historical. It is as difficult to suppose a person intending to write a modern English, as to suppose him writing an ancient English novel; that is a label which begs the question. One writes the novel, one paints the picture of one's language and of one's time, and calling it modem English, will not, alas! make the difficult task any easier. No more, unfortunately, will calling this or that work of one's fellow-artist a romance — unless it be, of course, simply for the pleasantness of the thing, as, for instance, when Hawthorne gave this heading to his story of Blithedale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French, who have brought the theory of fiction to remarkable completeness, have but one word for the novel, and have not attempted smaller things in it, that I can see, for that. I can think of no obligation to which the &quot;romancer&quot; would not be held equally with the novelist; the standard of execution is equally high for each. Of course it is of execution that we are talking, — that being the only point of a novel that is open to contention. This is, perhaps, too often lost sight of, only to produce interminable confusions and cross-purposes. We must grant the artist his subject, his idea, what, the French call his &lt;em&gt;donn &lt;strong&gt;é&lt;/strong&gt; e&lt;/em&gt; our criticism is applied only to what he makes of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally I do not mean that we are bound to like it or find it interesting; in case we do not, our course is perfectly simple, to let it alone. We may believe that of a certain idea even the most sincere novelist can make nothing at all, and the event may perfectly justify our belief; but the failure will have been a failure to execute, and it is in the execution that the fatal weakness is recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we pretend to respect the artist at all we must allow him his freedom of choice, in the face, in particular cases, of innumerable presumptions that the choice will not fructify. Art derives a considerable part of its beneficial exercise from flying in the face of presumptions, and some of the most interesting experiments of which it is capable are hidden in the bosom of common things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gustave Flaubert has written a story about the devotion of a servant-girl to a parrot, and the production, highly finished asit is, cannot on the whole be called a success. We are perfectly free to find it flat, but I think it might have been interesting; and I, for my part, am extremely glad he should have written it. It is a contribution to our knowledge of what can he done — or what cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan Turgenieff has written a tale about a deaf and dumb serf and a lap-dog, and the thing is touching, loving, a little masterpiece. He struck the note of life where Gustave Flaubert missed it; he flew in the face of a presumption and achieved a victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing, of course, will ever take the place of the good old fashion of &quot;liking&quot; a work of art or not liking it; the more improved criticism will not abolish that primitive, that ultimate, test. I mention this to guard myself from the accusation of intimating that the idea, the subject, of a novel or a picture does not matter. It matters, to my sense, in the highest degree, and if I might put up a prayer it would be that artists should select none but the richest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some, as I have already hastened to admit, are much more substantial than others, and it would be a happily arranged world in which persons intending to treat them should be exempt from confusions and mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fortunate condition will arrive only, I fear, on the same day that critics become purged from error. Meanwhile, I repeat, we do not judge the artist with fairness unless we say to him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, I grant you your starting-point, because if I did not I should seem to prescribe toyou, and heaven forbid I should take that responsibility. If I pretend to tell you what you must not take, you will call upon me to tell you then what you must take; in which case I shall be nicely caught! Moreover, it isn't till I have accepted your data that I can begin to measure you. I have the standard; I judge you by what you propose, and you must look out for me there. Of course I may not care for your idea at all; I may think it silly, or stale, or unclean; in which case I wash my hands of you altogether. I may content myself with believing that you will not have succeeded in being interesting, but I shall, of course, not attempt to demonstrate it, and you will be as indifferent to me as I am to you. I needn't remind you that there are all sorts of tastes; who can know it better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some people, for excellent reasons, don't like to read about carpenters; others, for reasons even better, don't like to read about courtesans. Many object to Americans. Others (I believe they are mainly editors and publishers) won't look at Italians. Some readers don't like quiet subjects; others don't like bustling ones. Some enjoy a complete illusion; others revel in a complete deception. They choose their novels accordingly, and if they don't care about your idea they won't, a fortiori, care about your treatment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that it comes back very quickly, as I have said, to the liking; in spite of M. Zola, who reasons less powerfully than he represents, and who will not reconcile himself to this absoluteness of taste, thinking that there are certain things that people ought to like, and that they can be made to like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am quite at a loss to imagine anything (at any rate in this matter of fiction) that people ought to like or to dislike. Selection will be sure to take care of itself, for it has a constant motive behind it. That motive is simply experience. As people feel life, so they will feel the art that is most closely related to it. This closeness of relation is what we should never forget in talking of the effort of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people speak of it as a factitious, artificial form, a product of ingenuity, the business of which is to alter and arrange the things that surround us, to translate them into conventional, traditional moulds. This, however, is a view of the matter which carries us but a very short way, condemns the art to an eternal repetition of a few familiar clichés, cuts short its development, and leads us straight up to a dead wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catching the very note and trick, the strange irregular rhythm of life, that is the attempt whose strenuous force keeps Fiction upon her feet. In proportion as in what she offers us we see life without rearrangement, do we feel that we are touching the truth; in proportion as we see it with rearrangement do we feel that we are being put off with a substitute, a compromise and convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon to hear an extraordinary assurance of remark in regard to this matter of rearranging, which is often spoken of as if it were the last word of art. Mr. Besant seems to me in danger of falling into this great error with his rather unguarded talk about &quot;selection.&quot; Art is essentially selection, but it is a selection whose main care is to be typical, to be inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many people art means rose-colored windows, and selection means picking a bouquet for Mrs. Grundy. They will tell you glibly that artistic considerations have nothing to do with the disagreeable, with the ugly; they will rattle off shallow commonplaces about the province of art and the limits of art, till you are moved to some wonder in return as to the province and the limits of ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears to me that no one can ever have made a seriously artistic attempt without becoming conscious of an immense increase — a kind of revelation — of freedom. One perceives, in that case — by the light of a heavenly ray — that the province of art is all life, all feeling, all observation, all vision. As Mr. Besant so justly intimates, it is all experience. That is a sufficient answer to those who maintain that it must not touch the painful, who stick into its divine unconscious bosom little prohibitory inscriptions on the end of sticks, such as we see in public gardens – &quot;It is forbidden to walk on the grass; it is forbidden to touch the flowers; it is not allowed to introduce dogs, or to remain after dark; it is requested to keep to the right.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young aspirant in the line of fiction, whom we continue to imagine, will do nothing without taste, for in that case his freedom would be of little use to him; but the first advantage of his taste will be to reveal to him the absurdity of the little sticks and tickets. If he have taste, I must add, of course he will have ingenuity, and my disrespectful reference to that quality just now was not meant to imply that it is useless in fiction. But it is only a secondary aid; the first is a vivid sense of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-v&quot;&gt;Chapter V&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-story-and-the-novel--idea--form&quot;&gt;The Story and the Novel — Idea &amp;amp; Form&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Besant has some remarks on the question of &quot;the story,&quot; which I shall not attempt to criticise, though they seem to me to contain a singular ambiguity, because I do not think I understand them. I cannot see what is meant by talking as if there were a part of a novel which is the story and part of it which for mystical reasons is not — unless indeed the distinction be made in a sense in which it is difficult to suppose that anyone should attempt to convey anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The story,&quot; if it represents anything, represents the subject, the idea, the data of the novel; and there is surely no &quot;school &quot; — Mr. Besant speaks of a school — which urges that a novel should be all treatment and no subject. There must assuredly be something to treat; every school is intimately conscious of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sense of the story being the idea, the starting-point, of the novel, is the only one that I see in which it can he spoken of as something different from its organic whole; and since, in proportion as the work is successful, the idea permeates and penetrates it, informs and animates it, so that every word and every punctuation-point contribute directly to the expression, in that proportion do we lose our sense of the story being a blade which may be drawn more or less out of its sheath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story and the novel, the idea and the form, are the needle and thread, and I never heard of a guild of tailors who recommended the use of the thread without the needle or the needle without the thread. Mr. Besant is not the only critic who may be observed to have spoken as if there were certain things in life which constitute stories and certain others which do not. I find the same odd implication in an entertaining article in the &lt;em&gt;Pall Mall Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, devoted, as it happens, to Mr. Besant's lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The story is the thing!&quot; says this graceful writer, as if with a tone of opposition to another idea. I should think it was, as every painter who, as the time for &quot;sending in&quot; his picture looms in the distance, finds himself still in quest of a subject — as every belated artist, not fixed about his donnée, will heartily agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some subjects which speak to us, and others which do not, but he would be a clever man who should undertake to give a rule by which the story and the no-story should be known apart. It is impossible (to me at least) to imagine any such rule which shall not be altogether arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writer in the &lt;em&gt;Pall Mall&lt;/em&gt; opposes the delightful (as I suppose) novel of &quot;Margot la Balafree&quot; to certain tales in which &quot;Bostonian nymphs&quot; appear to have &quot;rejected English dukes for psychological reasons.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iam not acquainted with the romance just designated, and can scarcely forgive the Pall Mall critic for not mentioning the name of the author; but the title appears to refer to a lady who may have received a scar in some heroic adventure. I am inconsolable at not being acquainted with this episode, but am utterly at a loss to see why it is a story when the rejection (or acceptance) of a duke is not, and why a reason, psychological or other, is not a subject when a cicatrix is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are all particles of the multitudinous life with which the novel deals, and surely no dogma which pretends to make it lawful to touch the one and unlawful to touch the other will stand for a moment on its feet. It is the special picture that must stand or fall, according as it seems to possess truth or to lack it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Besant does not, to my sense, light up the subject by intimating that a story must, under penalty of not being a story, consist of &quot;adventures.&quot; Why of adventures more than of green spectacles? He mentions a category of impossible things, and among them he places &quot;fiction without adventure.&quot; Why without adventure more than without matrimony, or celibacy, or parturition, or cholera, or hydropathy, or Jansenism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to me to bring the novel back to the hapless little role of being an artificial, ingenious thing — bring it down from its large, free character of an immense and exquisite correspondence with life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what is adventure, when it comes to that, and by what signis the listening pupil to recognize it? It is an adventure— an immense one — for me to write this little article; and for a Bostonian nymph to reject an English duke is an adventure only less stirring, I should say, than for an English duke to be rejected by a Bostonian nymph. I see dramas within dramas in that, and innumerable points of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A psychological reason is, to my imagination, an object adorably pictorial; to catch the tint of its complexion — I feel as if that idea might inspire one to Titianesque efforts. There are few things more exciting to me, in short, than a psychological reason, and yet, I protest, the novel seems to me the most magnificent form of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have just been reading, at the same time, the delightful story of &lt;em&gt;Treasure Island&lt;/em&gt;, by Mr. Robert &quot;Louis Stevenson, and the last tale from M. Edmond de Goncourt, which is entitled &lt;em&gt;Cherie&lt;/em&gt;. One of these works treats of murders, mysteries, islands of dreadful renown, hairbreadth escapes, miraculous coincidences and buried doubloons. The other treats of a little French girl who lived in a fine house in Paris and died of wounded sensibility because no one would marry her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call &lt;em&gt;Treasure Island&lt;/em&gt; delightful, because it appears to me to have succeeded wonderfully in what it attempts; and I venture to bestow no epithet upon &lt;em&gt;Cherie&lt;/em&gt;, which strikes me as having failed in what it attempts — that is, in tracing the development of the moral consciousness of a child. But one of these productions strikes me as exactly as much of a novel as the other, and as having a &quot;story&quot; quite as much. The moral consciousness of a child is as much a part of life as the islands of the Spanish Main, and the one sort of geography seems to me to have those &quot;surprises&quot; of which Mr. Besant speaks, quite as much as the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For myself (since it comes back in the last resort, as I say, to the preference of the individual), the picture of the child's experience has the advantage that I can at successive steps (an immense luxury, near to the &quot;sensual pleasure&quot; of which Mr. Besant's critic in the Pall Mall speaks) say Yes or No, as it may be, to what the artist puts before me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been a child, but I have never been on a quest for a buried treasure, and it is a simple accident that with M. de Goncourt I should have for the most part to say No. With George Eliot, when she painted that country, I always said Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-vi&quot;&gt;Chapter VI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-conscious-moral-purpose-of-the-novel&quot;&gt;The Conscious Moral Purpose of the Novel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part of Mr. Besant's lecture is unfortunately the briefest passage — his very cursory allusion to the &quot;conscious moral purpose&quot; of the novel. Here again it is not very clear whether he is recording a fact or laying down a principle; it is a great pity that in the latter case he should not have developed his idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This branch of the subject is of immense importance, and Mr. Besant's few words point to considerations of the widest reach, not to be lightly disposed of. He will have treated the art of fiction but superficially who is not prepared to go every inch of the way that these considerations will carry him. It is for this reason that at the beginning of these remarks I was careful to notify the reader that my reflections on so large a theme have no pretension to be exhaustive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Mr. Besant, I have left the question of the morality of the novel till the last, and at the last I find I have used up my space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a question surrounded with difficulties, as witness the very first that meets us, in the form of a definite question, on the threshold. Vagueness, in such a discussion, is fatal, and what is the meaning of your morality and your conscious moral purpose? Will you not define your terms and explain how (a novel being a picture) a picture can be either moral or immoral?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You wish to paint a moral picture or carve a moral statue; will you not tell us how you would set about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are discussing the Art of Fiction; questions of art are questions (in the widest sense) of execution; questions of morality are quite another affair, and will you not let us see how it is that you find it so easy to mix them up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things are so clear to Mr. Besant that he has deduced from them a law which he sees embodied in English Fiction and which is &quot;a truly admirable thing and a great cause for congratulation.&quot; It is a great cause for congratulation, indeed, when such thorny problems become as smooth as silk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may add that, in so far as Mr. Besant perceives that in point of fact English Fiction has addressed itself preponderantly to these delicate questions, he will appearto many people to have made a vain discovery. They will have been positively struck, on the contrary, with the moral timidity of the usual English novelist; with his (or with her) aversion to face the difficulties with which, on every side, the treatment of reality bristles. He is apt to be extremely shy (whereas the picture that Mr. Besant draws is a picture of boldness), and the sign of his work, for the most part, is a cautious silence on certain subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the English novel (by which I mean the American as well), more than in any other, there is a traditional difference between that which people know and that which they agree to admit that they know, that which they see and that which they speak of, that which they feel to be a part of life and that which they allow to enter into literature. There is the great difference, in short, between what they talk of in conversation, and what they talk of in print.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essence of moral energy is to survey the whole field, and I should directly reverse Mr. Besant's remark, and say, not that the English novel has a purpose, but that it has a diffidence. To what degree a purpose in a work of art is a source of corruption I shall not attempt to inquire; the one that seems to me least dangerous is the purpose of making a perfect work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for our novel, I may say, lastly, on this score, that, as we find it in England today, it strikes me as addressed in a large degree to &quot;young people,&quot; and that this in itself constitutes a presumption that it will be rather shy. There are certain things which it is generally agreed not to discuss, not even to mention, before young people. That is very well, but the absence of discussion is not a symptom of the moral passion. The purpose of the English novel — &quot;a truly admirable thing, and a great cause for congratulation&quot; — strikes me, therefore, as rather negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one point at which the moral sense and the artistic sense lie very near together; that is, in the light of the very obvious truth that the deepest quality of a work of art will always be the quality of the mind of the producer. In proportion as that mind is rich and noble, will the novel, the picture, the statue, partake of the substance of beauty and truth. To be constituted of such elements is, to my vision, to have purpose enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No good novel will ever proceed from a superficial mind; that seems to me an axiom which, for the artist in fiction, will cover all needful moral ground; if the youthful aspirant take it to heart, it will illuminate for him many of the mysteries of &quot;purpose.&quot; There are many other useful things that might be said to him, but I have come to the end of my article, and can only touch them as I pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critic in the &lt;em&gt;Pall Mall Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, whom I have already quoted, draws attention to the danger, in speaking of the art of fiction, of generalizing. The danger that he has in mind is rather, I imagine, that of particularizing; for there are some comprehensive remarks which, in addition to those embodied in Mr. Besant's suggestive lecture, might, without fear of misleading him, be addressed to the ingenuous student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should remind him first of the magnificence of the form that is open to him, which offers to sight so few restrictions and such innumerable opportunities. The other arts, in comparison, appear confined and hampered; the various conditions under which they are exercised are so rigid and definite. But the only condition that I can think of attaching to the composition of the novel is, as I have already said, that it be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This freedom is a splendid privilege, and the first lesson of the young novelist is to learn to be worthy of it. &quot;Enjoy it as it deserves,&quot; I should say to him; &quot;take possession of it, explore it to its utmost extent, reveal it, rejoice in it. All life belongs to you, and don't listen either to those who would shut you up into corners of it and tell you that it is only here and there that art inhabits, or to those who would persuade you that this heavenly messenger wings her way outside of life altogether, breathing a superfine air and turning away her head from the truth of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no impression of life, no manner of seeing it and feeling it, to which the plan of the novelist may not offer a place; you have only to remember that talents so dissimilar as those of Alexandre Dumas and Jane Austen, Charles Dickens and Gustave Flaubert, have worked in this field with equal glory. Don't think too much about optimism and pessimism; try and catch the color of life itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In France to-day we see a prodigious effort (that of Émile Zola, to whose solid and serious work no explorer of the capacity of the novel can allude without respect), we see an extraordinary effort, vitiated by a spirit of pessimism on a narrow basis. M. Zola is magnificent, but he strikes an English reader as ignorant; he has an air of working in the dark; if he had as much light as energy, his results would be of the highest value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the aberrations of a shallow optimism, the ground (of English fiction especially) is strewn with their brittle particles as with broken glass. If you must indulge in conclusions, let them have the taste of a wide knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that your first duty is to be as complete as possible — to make as perfect a work. Be generous and delicate, and then, in the vulgar phrase, &quot;go in!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain of the opinions put forward in the following pages were first expressed briefly (and anonymously) in the columns of the &lt;em&gt;Saturday Review&lt;/em&gt; of London in the summer of 1884. The present paper, in which these opinions were more elaborately set forth, and with a greater variety of illustration, was originally printed in &lt;em&gt;Lippincott's Magazine&lt;/em&gt; for October, 1885. After a while it was included in a volume called &quot;Pen and Ink: Essays on subjects of more or less importance,&quot; published in the fall of 1888 (New York and London: Longmans, Green, &amp;amp; Co).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final ten years of the nineteenth century an increasing attention has been paid to the history of fiction and to the principles of narrative art. In many of the leading American universities the modern novel has been serving as the subject for lectures and as the material for private study, in the course of which the Short-story received a fair share of consideration. No doubt, it is in consequence of this incessant discussion of modern fiction and of its methods that the author and the publishers have been made aware of a demand for the present essay, with such revision and annotation as might render it more useful, not only to the earnest student, but also to the casual reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-principles-and-the-practice-of-the-art-of-writing-stories&quot;&gt;the Principles and the Practice of the Art of Writing Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it chance that artists fall to talking about their art, it is the critic's place to listen, that he may pick up a little knowledge. Of late, certain of the novelists of Great Britain and the United States have been discussing the principles and the practice of the art of writing stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Howells declared his warm appreciation of Mr. Henry James's novels; Mr. Stevenson made public a delightful plea for Romance; Mr. Besant lectured gracefully on the &lt;em&gt;Art of Fiction&lt;/em&gt;; and Mr. James modestly presented his views by way of supplement and criticism. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Mr. Besant’s lecture was published in a pamphlet (London: Chatto and Windus). Mr. James's essay may be found in his ‘Partial Portraits’ (London and New York: Macmillan Sc Co). Mr. Stevenson's ‘Humble Remonstrance,' as well as his cognate ‘Gossip on Romance,' are included in the volume called ‘Memories and Portraits' (New York : Scribner; London: Chatto and Windus). The substance of Mr. Howells’ s doctrines can be found succinctly set forth in his little book called ‘Criticism and Fiction’ (New York : Harper &amp;amp; Brothers).
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion took a wide range. With more or less fulness it covered the proper aim and intent of the novelist, his material and his methods, his success, his rewards, social and pecuniary, and the morality of his work and of his art. But, with all its extension, the discussion did not include one important branch of the art of fiction: it did not consider at all the minor art of the Short-story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although neither Mr. Howells nor Mr. Janies, Mr. Besant nor Mr. Stevenson specifically limited his remarks to those longer, and, in the picture-dealer's sense of the word, more &quot;important,&quot; tales known as Novels, and although, of course, their general criticisms of the abstract principles of the art of fiction applied quite as well to the Short-story as to the Novel, yet all their concrete examples were full-length Novels; and the Short-story, as such, received no recognition at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[And here occasion serves to record with regret the fact that even in the more recent volumes on the history of fiction published since the original appearance of the present essay in 1885, — valuable as they are and most welcome to all lovers of literature, — there is a strange neglect of the Short-story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relation of the Short-story to the Novel, and the influence which the one may at any time have exerted upon the development of the other, — these are topics not taken up in Professor Walter Raleigh's &lt;em&gt;The English Novel&lt;/em&gt;, or in Professor W. L. Cross's &lt;em&gt;Development of the English Novel&lt;/em&gt;, or in Professor F. H. Stoddard's &lt;em&gt;Evolution of the English Novel&lt;/em&gt;, They are not discussed even in Mr. Henry Wilson's annotated edition of Dunlop's &lt;em&gt;History of Prose Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, in which there is a genuine effort to consider all the aspects of the art of the story-teller.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-ii&quot;&gt;Chapter II&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;a-true-short-story--something-more-than-a-mere-story-which-is-short&quot;&gt;A True Short Story — Something More Than a Mere Story Which Is Short&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between a Novel and a Novelet is one of length only: a Novelet is a brief Novel. But the difference between a Novel and a Short-story is a difference of kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true Short-story is something other and something more than a mere story which Is short. A true Short-story differs from the Novel chiefly in its essential unity of impression. In a far more exact and precise use of the word, a Short-story has unity as a Novel cannot have it. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; In a letter to a friend, Stevenson lays down the law with his usual directness: “Make another end to it? Ah, yes, but that’s not the way I write; the whole tale is implied; I never use an effect when I can help it, unless it prepares the effects that are to follow; that’s what a story consists in. To make another end, that is to make the beginning all wrong. The dénouement of a long story is nothing, it is just ‘a full close,’ which you may approach and accompany as you please — it is a coda, not an essential member in the rhythm; but the body and end of a short-story is bone of the bane and blood of the blood of the beginning.” &lt;i&gt;Vailima Letters&lt;/i&gt;, vol. i., p. 147.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, it may be noted by the way, the Short-story fulfils the three false unities of the French classic drama: it shows one action, in one place, on one day. A Short-story deals with a single character, a single event, a single emotion, or the series of emotions called forth by a single situation. Poe's paradox *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [3]&lt;/sup&gt; that a poem cannot greatly exceed a hundred lines in length under penalty of ceasing to be one poem and breaking into a string of poems, may serve to suggest the precise difference between the Short-story and the Novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; See his essay on ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.talesofmurder.com/murderwiki/philosophy-of-composition/&quot;&gt;The Philosophy of Composition&lt;/a&gt;,’ to be found in the sixth volume of the collected edition of his works, prepared by Messrs. Stedman and Woodberry.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Short-story is the single effect, complete and self-contained, while the Novel is of necessity broken into a series of episodes. Thus the Short-story has, what the Novel cannot have, the effect of &quot;totality,&quot; as Poe called it, the unity of impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of a truth the Short-story is not only not a chapter out of a Novel, or an incident or an episode extracted from a longer tale, but at its best it impresses the reader with the belief that it would be spoiled if it were made larger, or if it were incorporated into a more elaborate work. The difference in spirit and in form between the Lyric and the Epic is scarcely greater than the difference between the Short-story and the Novel; and the 'Raven' and 'How we brought the good news from Ghent to Aix ' are not more unlike the 'Lady of the Lake' and 'Paradise Lost,'in form and in spirit, than the 'Luck of Roaring Camp,' and the 'Man without a Country,' two typical Short-stories, are unlike ' Vanity Fair ' and the 'Heart of Midlothian,' two typical Novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great difference between the Short-story and the Novel lies in the feet that the Novel, nowadays at least, must be a love-tale, while the Short-story need not deal with love at all. Although there are to be found by diligent search a few Novels which are not love-tales — and of course 'Robinson Crusoe' is the example that swims at once into recollection — yet the immense majority of Novels have the tender passion either as the motive power of their machinery or as the pivot on which their plots turn. Although _Vanity Fair'_was a Novel without a hero, nearly every other Novel has a hero and a heroine; and the novelist, however unwillingly, must concern himself in their love-affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the writer of Short-stories is under no bonds of this sort. Of course he may tell a tale of love if he choose, and if love enters into his tale naturally and to its enriching; but he need not bother with love at all unless he please. Some of the best of Short-stories are love-stories too, — Mr. Aldrich's &lt;em&gt;Margery Daw&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, Mr. Stimson's &lt;em&gt;Mrs. Knollys&lt;/em&gt;, Mr. Bunner's &lt;em&gt;Love in Old Cloathes&lt;/em&gt;; but more of them are not love-stories at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were to pick out the ten best Short-stories, I think we should find that fewer than half of them made any mention at all of love. In the 'Snow Image' and in the ' Ambitious Guest,' in the ' Gold Bug' and in the 'Fall of the House of Usher,' in 'My Double, and how he Undid me,' in ' Devil-Puzzlers,' in the 'Outcasts of Poker Flat,' in 'Jean-ah Poquelin,' in ' A Bundle of Letters,' there is little or no mention of the love of man for woman, which is generally the chief topic of conversation in a Novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Novel cannot get on easily without love, the Short-story can. Since love seems to be almost the only thing which will give interest to a long story, the writer of Novels has to get love into his tales as best he may, even when the subject rebels and when he himself is too old to take any delight in the mating of John and Joan. But the Short-story, being brief, does not need a love-interest to hold its parts together, and the writer of Short-stories has thus a greater freedom; he may do as he pleases; from him a love-tale is not expected. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; In an essay on ‘The Local Short-story’ contributed to the &lt;i&gt;Independent&lt;/i&gt; for March n, 1892, Colonel T. W. Higginson points out the disadvantages the novelist labours under when he knows that his work is to be published in instalments; and he declares that this possible serial publication “affords the justification of the short-story. For here, at least, we have the conditions of perfect art; there is no sub-division of interest; the author can strike directly in, without preface, can move with determined step toward a conclusion, and can — O highest privilege! — stop when he is done.
For the most perfect examples of the short-story — those of De Maupassant, for instance — the reader feels, if he can pause to think, that they must have been done at a sitting, so complete is the grasp, the single grasp, upon the mind. This completeness secures the end; they need not be sensational, because there is no necessity of keeping up a series of exciting minor incidents; the main incident is enough. Around the very centre of motion, as in a whirlwind, there may be a perfect quiet, a quiet which is formidable in its very repose. In De Maupassant's terrific story of Corsican vengeance, ‘Une Vendetta,’ in which the sole actor is a lonely old woman who trains a fierce dog so that he ultimately kills her enemy, the author simply tells us, at the end, that this quiet fiend of destruction went peacefully home and went to sleep. Elle dormit bien, cette nuit-là. The cyclone has spent itself, and the silence it has left behind it is more formidable than the cyclone.”
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But other things are required of a writer of Short-stories which are not required of a writer of Novels. The novelist may take his time; he has abundant room to turn about. The writer of Short-stories must be concise, and compression, a vigorous compression, is essential. For him, more than for anyone else, the half is more than the whole. Again, the novelist may be commonplace, he may bend his best energies to the photographic reproduction of the actual; if he shows us a cross-section of real life we are content; but the. writer of Short-stories, must have originality and ingenuity. If to compression, originality, and ingenuity he adds also a touch of fantasy, so much the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it may be said that no one has ever succeeded as a writer of Short-stories who had not ingenuity, originality, and compression; and that most of those who have succeeded in this line had also the touch of fantasy. But there are not a few successful novelists lacking, not only in fantasy and compression, but also in ingenuity and originality; they had other qualities, no doubt, but these they had not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an example must be given, the name of Anthony Trollope will occur to all. Fantasy was a thing he abhorred; compression he knew not; and originality and ingenuity can be conceded to him only by a strong stretch of the ordinary meaning of the words. Other qualities he had in plenty, but not these. And, not having them, he was not a writer of Short-stories. Judging from his essay on Hawthorne *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [5]&lt;/sup&gt;, one may even go so far as to say that Trollope did not know a good Short-story when he saw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; This critical paper of Trollope’s on ‘The Genius of Nathaniel Hawthorne’ was contributed to the &lt;i&gt;North American Review&lt;/i&gt; for September, 1879. Apparently, like many other of his essays, it has not been reprinted.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written &quot;Short-stories&quot; with a capital S and a hyphen because I wished to emphasise the distinction between the Short-story and the story which is merely short. The Short-story is a high and difficult department of fiction. The story which is short can be written by anybody who can write at all; and it may be good, bad, or indifferent; but at its best it is wholly unlike the Short-story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;An Editor's Tales&lt;/em&gt; Trollope has given us excellent specimens of the story which is short; and the narratives which make up this book are amusing enough and clever enough, but they are wanting in the individuality and in the completeness of the genuine Short-story. Like the brief tales to be seen in the British monthly magazines and in the Sunday editions of American newspapers into which they are copied, they are, for the most part, either merely amplified anecdotes or else incidents which might have been used in a Novel just as well as not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it cannot be said too emphatically that the genuine Short-story abhors the idea of the Novel. It neither can be conceived as part of the novel, nor can it be elaborated and expanded so as to form a Novel. A good Short-story is no more the synopsis of a Novel than it is an episode from a Novel.*  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [6]&lt;/sup&gt; A slight Novel, or a Novel cut down, is a Novelet: it is not a Short-story. Mr. Howells's 'Their Wedding Journey ' and Miss Howard's 'One Summer' are Novelets, — little Novels. Mr. Anstey's 'Vice Versa,' Mr. Besant's 'Case of Mr. Lucraft,' Hugh Conway's 'Called Back,' Mr. Julian Hawthorne's 'Archibald Malmaison,' and Mr. Stevenson's 'Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' are Short-stories in conception, although they are without the compression which the Short-story requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; In some rambling notes on “The Short-story” contributed to the &lt;i&gt;Nineteenth Century&lt;/i&gt; for March, 1898, Mr. Frederick Wedmore reiterates certain of the points made in this essay. For one thing, he declares that a good Short-story can never be ‘a novel in a nut-shell’; it “cannot possibly be a précis, a synopsis, a scenario, as it were, of a novel. It is a separate thing — as separate, almost, as the Sonnet is from the Epic, — it involves the exercise almost of a different art.”
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be remembered that in the acute and learned essay on &lt;em&gt;vers de société&lt;/em&gt; which he prefixed to his admirable 'Lyra Elegantiarum,' Mr. Frederick Locker declared that the two characteristics of the best &lt;em&gt;vers de soci__ é &lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt; é&lt;/em&gt; were brevity and brilliancy, and that the 'Rape of the Lock' would be the type and model of the best &lt;em&gt;vers de soci &lt;strong&gt;é&lt;/strong&gt; t__é&lt;/em&gt; — if it were not just a little too long. So it is with the 'Case of Mr. Lucaft,' with 'Vice Versa,' with 'Archibald Malmaison': they are just a little too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-iii&quot;&gt;Chapter III&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-short-story-is-nothing-if-there-is-no-story-to-tell&quot;&gt;The Short-Story Is Nothing If There Is No Story To Tell&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is to be noted as a curious coincidence that there is no exact word in English to designate either &lt;em&gt;vers de société&lt;/em&gt; or the Short-story, and yet in no language are there better &lt;em&gt;vers de société&lt;/em&gt; or Short-stories than in English. It may be remarked also that there is a certain likeness between &lt;em&gt;vers de société&lt;/em&gt; and Short-stories: for one thing, both seem easy to write and are hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the typical qualifications of each may apply with almost equal force to the other: &lt;em&gt;vers de société&lt;/em&gt; should reveal compression, ingenuity, and originality, and Short-stones should have brevity and brilliancy. In no class of writing are neatness of construction and polish of execution more needed than in the writing of &lt;em&gt;vers de société&lt;/em&gt; and of Short-stories. The writer of Short-stories must have the sense of form, which has well been called &quot;the highest and last attribute of a creative writer.&quot; The construction must always be logical, adequate, harmonious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the weak spot in Mr. W. H. Bishop's 'One of the Thirty Pieces,' the fundamental idea of which — that fatality awaits every successive possessor of every one of the coins once paid to Judas for his betrayal of Jesus — has genuine strength, not fully developed in the story. But other of Mr. Bishop's stories — the 'Battle of Bunkerloo,' for instance — are admirable in all ways, conception and execution having an even excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, Hugh Conway's 'Daughter of the Stars' is a Short-story which fails from sheer deficiency of style: here is one of the very finest Short-story ideas — the startling and fascinating fantasy that by sheer force of will a man might have been able to draw down from the depths of the sky a lovely astral maid to share his finite human life — ever given to any mortal, but the handling is at best barely sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do justice to the conception would tax the execution of a poet. We could merely wonder what the tale would have been had it occurred to Hawthorne, to Poe, or to Théophile Gautier. An idea logically developed by one possessing the sense of form and the gift of style is what we look for in the Short-story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, although the sense of form and the gift of style are essential to the writing of a good Short-story, they are secondary to the idea, to the conception, to the subject. Those who hold, with a certain American novelist, that it is no matter what you have to say, but only how you say it, need not attempt the Short-story; for the Short-story, far more than the Novel even, demands a subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Short-story is nothing if there is no story to tell; — one might almost say that a Short-story is nothing if it has no plot, — except that &quot; plot &quot; may suggest to some readers a complication and an elaboration which are not really needful. But a plan — if this word is less liable to misconception than &quot;plot&quot; — a plan a Short-story must have, while it would be easy to cite Novels of eminence which are wholly amorphous — for example, 'Tristram Shandy.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever its length, the Novel, so Mr. Henry James told us not long ago, &quot; is, in its broadest definition, a personal impression of life.&quot; The most powerful force in French fiction today is M. Émile Zola, chiefly known in America and England, I fear me greatly, by the dirt which masks and degrades the real beauty and firm strength not seldom concealed in his novels; and M. Émile Zola declares that the novelist of the future will not concern himself with the artistic evolution of a plot: he will take &lt;em&gt;une histoire quelconque&lt;/em&gt;, any kind of a story, and make it serve his purpose, — which is to give elaborate pictures of life in all its most minute details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is needless to say that the acceptance of these theories is a negation of the Short-story. Important as are form and style, the subject of the Short-story is of more importance yet. What you have to tell is of greater interest than how you tell it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once heard a clever American novelist pour sarcastic praise upon another American novelist, — for novelists, even American novelists, do not always dwell together in unity. The subject of the eulogy was the chief of those who had come to be known as the International Novelists; and he was praised because he had invented and made possible a fifth plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hitherto, declared the eulogist, only four terminations of a novel have been known to the most enthusiastic and untiring student of fiction. First, they are married; or second, she marries someone else; or, thirdly, he marries someone else; or fourthly, and lastly, she dies. Now, continued the panegyrist, a fifth termination has been shown to be practicable: they are not married, she does not die, he does not die, — and nothing happens at all. As a Short-story need not be a love-story, it is of no consequence at all whether they marry or die; but a Short-story in which nothing happens at all is an absolute impossibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the difference between a Short-story and a Sketch can best be indicated by saying that, while a Sketch may be still-life, in a Short-story something always happens. A Sketch may be an outline of character, or even a picture of a mood of mind, but in a Short-story there must be something done, there must be an action. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; This difference is considered briefly by Mr. F. B. Perkins in the characteristically clever preface to the volume of his ingenious Short-stories, which takes its title from the first and best — ‘Devil-Puzzlers' (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons).
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the distinction, like that between the Novel and the Romance, is no longer of vital importance. In the preface to the 'House of the Seven Gables,' Hawthorne sets forth the difference between the Novel and the Romance, and claims for himself the privileges of the romancer. Mr. Henry James *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [8]&lt;/sup&gt; fails to see this difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; In the narrow but suggestive biography of Hawthorne contributed to Mr. John Morley’s ‘English Men of Letters.’
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is, that the Short-story and the Sketch, the Novel and the Romance, melt and merge one into the other, and no man may mete the boundaries of each, though their extremes lie far apart. With the more complete understanding of the principle of development and evolution in literary art, as in physical nature, we see the futility of a strict and rigid classification into precisely defined genera and species. All that is needful for us to remark now is that the Short-story has limitless possibilities: it may be as realistic as the most prosaic novel, or as fantastic as the most ethereal romance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;poe-and-hawthorne--as-american-in-style-as-anyone&quot;&gt;Poe and Hawthorne — As American In Style As Anyone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a touch of fantasy, however slight, is a welcome ingredient in a Short-story, and as the American takes more thought of things unseen than the Englishman, we may have here an incomplete explanation of the superiority of the American Short-story over the British.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;John Bull has suffered the idea of the Invisible to be very much fattened out of him,&quot; says Mr. Lowell. &quot;Jonathan is conscious still that he lives in the World of the Unseen as well as of the Seen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not enough to catch a ghost white-handed and to hale him into the full glare of the electric light. A brutal misuse of the supernatural is perhaps the very lowest degradation of the art of fiction. But &quot;to mingle the marvellous rather as a slight, delicate, and evanescent flavour than as any actual portion of the substance,&quot; to quote from the preface to the &lt;em&gt;House of the Seven Gables&lt;/em&gt;, this is, or should be, the aim of the writer of Short-stories whenever his feet leave the firm ground of fact as he strays in the unsubstantial realms of fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In no one's writings, it seems to me, is this better exemplified than in Hawthorne's, — not even in Poe's. There is a propriety in Hawthorne's fantasy to which Poe could not attain. Hawthorne's effects are moral, where Poe's are merely physical. The situation and its logical development, and the effects to be got out of it, are all Poe thinks of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Hawthorne the situation, however strange and weird, is only the outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual struggle. Ethical consequences are always worrying Hawthorne's soul: but Poe did not know that there were any ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are literary evolutionists who, in their whim of seeing in every original writer a copy of some predecessor, have declared that Hawthorne is derived from Tieck, and Poe from Hoffmann, just as Dickens modelled himself on Smollett, and Thackeray followed in the footsteps of Fielding. In all four cases the pupil surpassed the master, — if haply Tieck and Hoffmann can be considered as even remotely the masters of Hawthorne and Poe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Coleridge was told that Klopstock was the German Milton, he assented with the dry addendum, &quot;A very German Milton.&quot; So is Hoffmann a very German Poe; and Tieck, at best, is only a very German Hawthorne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, both Poe and Hawthorne are as American as anyone can be. If the adjective American has any meaning at all, it qualifies Poe and Hawthorne. They were American to the core. They both revealed the curious sympathy with Oriental moods of thought which is often an American characteristic. Poe, with his cold logic and his mathematical analysis, and Hawthorne, with his introspective conscience and his love of the subtle and the invisible, are representative of phases of American character not to be mistaken by anyone who has given thought to the influence of nationality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to which of the two was the greater, discussion is idle; but that Hawthorne was the finer genius, few would deny. Poe *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [9]&lt;/sup&gt;, as cunning an artificer of goldsmith's work and as adroit in its vending as was ever M. Josse, declared that &quot;Hawthorne's distinctive trait is invention, creation, imagination, originality, — a trait which in the literature of fiction is positively worth all the rest.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; In his review of Hawthorne's earlier tales, contributed originally to &lt;i&gt;Graham's Magazine&lt;/i&gt;, and to be consulted now in the seventh volume of the critical edition prepared by Messrs. Stedman and Woodberry. It is both interesting and instructive to compare this article on Hawthorne in which Poe vaunts the superiority of the Short-story over the Novel, with the paper on the ‘Philosophy of Composition,' in which he makes a similar claim for the Lyric over the Epic.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with the moral basis of Hawthorne's work, which had flowered in the crevices and crannies of New England Puritanism, Poe did not concern himself. In Poe's hands the story of the 'Ambitious Guest' might have thrilled us with a more powerful horror, but it would have lacked the ethical beauty which Hawthorne gave it and which makes it significant beyond a mere feat of verbal legerdemain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the subtle simplicity of the 'Great Stone Face' is as far from Poe as the pathetic irony of the 'Ambitious Guest.' In all his most daring fantasies Hawthorne is natural; and, though he may project his vision far beyond the boundaries of fact, nowhere does he violate the laws of nature. He had at all times a wholesome simplicity, and he never showed any trace of the morbid taint which characterises nearly all Poe's work. Hawthorne, one may venture to say, had the broad sanity of genius, while we should understand anyone who might declare that Poe had mental disease raised to the _n_th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it may be doubted whether the fiery and tumultuous rush of a volcano, which might be taken to typify Poe, is as powerful or impressive in the end as the calm and inevitable progression of a glacier, to which, for the purposes of this comparison only, we may liken Hawthorne, yet the weight and influence of Poe's work are indisputable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might hazard the assertion that in all Latin countries he is the best known of American authors. Certainly no American writer has been so widely accepted in France. Nothing better of its kind has ever been done than the 'Pit and the Pendulum,' or than the 'Fall of the House of Usher' (which has been compared aptly with Browning's 'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came ' for its power of suggesting intellectual desolation). Nothing better of its kind has ever been done than the 'Gold Bug,' or than the 'Purloined Letter,' or than the 'Murders in the Rue Morgue.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Murders in the Rue Morgue&lt;/em&gt; is indeed a story of the most marvellous skill: it was the first of its kind, and to this day it remains a model, not only unsurpassed, but unapproachable. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [10]&lt;/sup&gt;It was the first of detective stories; and it has had thousands of imitations and no rival. The originality, the ingenuity, the verisimilitude of this tale and of its fellows are beyond all praise. Poe had a faculty which one may call imaginative ratiocination to a degree beyond all other writers of fiction. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [11]&lt;/sup&gt; He did not at all times keep up to the high level, in one style, of the &lt;em&gt;Fall of the House of Usher&lt;/em&gt;, and, in another, of the &lt;em&gt;Murders in the Rue Morgue&lt;/em&gt;, and it was not to be expected that he should. Only too often did he sink to the grade of the ordinary &lt;em&gt;Tale from Blackwood&lt;/em&gt;, which he himself satirised in his usual savage vein of humour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; For example, it is not unfair to suggest that all the manifold feats of Dr. Conan Doyle's very clever ‘Sherlock Holmes’ are latent in one or another of these tales of Poe's, — M. Dupin being the prototype of Holmes himself, and the autobiographic narrator standing in the same attitude of wondering admiration that Dr. Watson takes in the British series.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; In his very suggestive study of Poe in ‘New Essays toward a critical method,' Mr. J. M. Robertson quotes from the Spanish critic Landa the statement that Poe “has been the first story-writer to exploit the field of science in the department of the marvelous;” and he has further been the first “to exploit the marvellous in morbid psychology with scientific art&quot; (p. 103).
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet there is no denying that even in his flimsiest and most tawdry tales we see the truth of Mr. Lowell's assertion that Poe had &quot;two of the prime qualities of genius, — a faculty of vigorous yet minute analysis, and a wonderful fecundity of imagination.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Loweil said also that Poe combined &quot;in a very remarkable manner two faculties which are seldom found united, — a power of influencing the mind of the reader by the impalpable shadows of mystery, and a minuteness of detail which does not leave a pin or a button unnoticed. Both are, in truth, the natural results of the predominating quality of his mind, to which we have before alluded, — analysis.&quot; *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [12]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; It is to be regretted that Lowell's acute criticism of Poe is not to be found in the complete edition of his own works, but only in an early and incomplete edition of Poe's.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Poe's hands, however, the enumeration of pins and buttons, the exact imitation of the prosaic facts of humdrum life in this workaday world, is not an end, but a means only, whereby he constructs and intensifies the shadow of mystery which broods over the things thus realistically portrayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;as-a-form-of-fiction-the-short-story-is-not-inferior-to-the-novel&quot;&gt;As a Form of Fiction the Short-story Is Not Inferior to the Novel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the recollection that it is more than half a century since Hawthorne and Poe wrote their best Short-stories, it is not a little comic to see now and again in American newspapers a rash assertion that American literature has hitherto been deficient in good Short-stories,&quot; or the reckless declaration that &quot; the art of writing Short-stories has not hitherto been cultivated in the United States.&quot; *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [13]&lt;/sup&gt; Nothing could be more inexact than these statements. Almost as soon as America began to have any literature at all it had good Short-stories. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [14]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; The reader may be reminded once more that this essay was written in 1885. Although these absurd assertions were not infrequent then, they are unknown now.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; It Is not without Interest to recall the fact that Irving’s ‘Sketch Book’ was the earliest work of American authorship to gain popularity in Great Britain, and that it originally appeared in parts in 1819-10, — the very first part containing ‘Rip van Winkle,’ a perfect specimen of the American Short-story with its delightful blending of fantasy and humour. And in a letter written to a friend in New York shortly after the publication of the ‘Tales of a Traveler,’ in 1814, Irving pointed out, with equal shrewdness and modesty, the reasons why the Short-story seemed to him more difficult than the Novel, and also discussed his own method of composition. (‘Life and Letters of Washington Irving.’ New York; G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1869, vol. ii. p. 117.)
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite within ten, or at the most twenty, years that the American novel has come to the front and forced the acknowledgment of its equality with the British novel and the French novel; but for fifty years the American Short-story has had a supremacy which any competent critic could not but acknowledge. Indeed, the present excellence of the American novel is due in great measure to the Short-story; for nearly every one of the American novelists whose works are now read by the whole English-speaking race began as a writer of Short-stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although as a form of fiction the Short-story is not inferior to the Novel, and although it is not easier, all things considered, yet its brevity makes its composition simpler for the 'prentice hand. Though the Short-stories of the beginner may not be good, yet in the writing of Short-stories he shall learn how to tell a story, he shall discover by experience the elements of the art of fiction more readily and, above all, more quickly, than if he had begun on a long and exhausting novel. The physical strain of writing a full-sized novel is far greater than the reader can well imagine. To this strain the beginner in fiction may gradually accustom himself by the composition of Short-stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Here, if the digression may be pardoned, occasion serves to say that if our writers of plays had the same chance that our writers of novels have, we might now have a school of American dramatists of which we should be as proud as of our school of American novelists. In dramatic composition, the equivalent of the Short-story is the one-act play, be it drama or comedy or comedietta or farce. As the novelists have learned their trade by the writing of Short-stories, so the dramatists might learn their trade, far more difficult as it is and more complicated, by the writing of one-act plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, while the magazines of the United States are hungry for good Short-stories, and sift carefully all that are sent to them, in hope of happening on a treasure, the theatres of the United States are closed to one-act plays, and the dramatist is denied the opportunity of making a humble and tentative beginning. The conditions of the theatre are such that there is little hope of a change for the better in this respect, — more's the pity. The manager has a tradition that a broken bill,&quot; as it is called, a program containing more than one play, is a confession of weakness; — and he prefers, so far as possible, to keep his weakness concealed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we read the roll of American novelists, we see that nearly all of them began as writers of Short-stories. Some of them, Mr. Bret Harte, for instance, and Dr. Edward Everett Hale, never got any farther, or, at least, if they wrote novels, their novels did not receive the full artistic appreciation and the ample popular approval bestowed on their Short-stories. Even Mr. Cable's admirable (Grandissimes' has not made his many readers forget his &lt;em&gt;Posson Jone&lt;/em&gt;;' nor has Mr. Aldrich's &lt;em&gt;Queen of Sheba&lt;/em&gt;, charming as she is, driven from our memory his &lt;em&gt;Margery Daw&lt;/em&gt; (as delightful and as captivating as that other non-existent heroine, Mr. Austin Dobson's &lt;em&gt;Dorothy&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Burnett, Miss Woolson, and Miss Murfree put forth volumes of Short-stories before they attempted the more sustained flight of the full-fledged Novel. Miss Jewett, Mr. Bunner, Mr. Bishop, and Mr. Julian Hawthorne wrote Short-stones before they wrote novels; and Mr. James has never gathered into a book from the back numbers of magazines the half of his earlier efforts. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [15]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; In the article from which a quotation has already been made (in a note on pp. 21, xx), Colonel Higginson called attention to the skill with which the local short-story in the hands of innumerable writers of both sexes in all parts of the United States has been made to yield the very form and colour of every section of our immense country and he remarks that “the rapid multiplication of the portable kodak has scarcely surpassed the swift growth of local writers, each apparently having the same equipment of directness and vigor. All the varied elements of our society are being rapidly sought out and exhibited. To begin on the soil longest wrought. Miss Wilkins has produced a series of moral pictures, as true and as terse as anything in literature, though she has, unhappily, left rather out of sight the more cultivated and ancestral aspects of New England life, to which, however, Miss Jewett has done ampler justice.”
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these references to the American magazine I believe I have suggested the real reason of the superiority of the American Short-stories over the British. It is not only that the eye of patriotism may detect more fantasy, more humour, a finer feeling for art, in these younger United States, but there is a more emphatic and material reason for the American proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is in the United States a demand for Short-stories which does not exist in Great Britain, or at any rate not in the same degree. The Short-story is of very great importance to the American magazine. But in the British magazine the serial Novel is the one thing of consequence, and all else is termed &quot;padding.&quot; In England the writer of three-volume Novels is the best paid of literary labourers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is to be noted that whoever in England has the gift of story-telling is strongly tempted not to essay the difficult art of writing Short-stories, for which he will receive only an inadequate reward; and he is as strongly tempted to write a long story which may serve first as a serial and afterward as a three-volume Novel. The result of this temptation is seen in the fact that there is not a single British novelist whose reputation has been materially assisted by the Short-stories he has written. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [16]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; Since this was written the Short-stories of R. L. Stevenson and of Mr. Kipling have proved again how dangerous it is to generalise from special conditions.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than once in the United States a single Short-story has made a man known; but in Great Britain such an event is well-nigh impossible. The disastrous effect on narrative art of the desire to distend every subject to the three-volume limit has been dwelt on unceasingly by British critics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three-volume system is peculiar to Great Britain: it does not obtain either in France or the United States. As a consequence, the French or American writer of fiction is left free to treat his subject at the length it demands, — no more and no less. It is pleasant to note that there are signs of the beginning of the break-up of the system even in England; and the protests of the chief British critics against it are loud and frequent. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [17]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; It is satisfactory to record now that the three-volume system has disappeared at last, and finally, in the years that have elapsed since this paragraph was originally penned. Its extinction moved Mr. Rudyard Kipling to chant its requiem in a series of satirical stanzas, called ‘The Three-Decker,’ and now to be found with his other later lyrics in ‘The Seven Seas.’
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was this three-volume system which was responsible in great measure for the invention and protection of the British machine for making British Novels, of which Mr. Warner told us in his enter-tuning essay on fiction. We all know the work of this machine, and we all recognise the trade-mark it imprints in the corner. But Mr. Warner failed to tell us, what nevertheless is a fact, that this British machine can be geared down so as to turn out the British short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the British short story, as the machine makes it and as we see it in most British magazines, is only a little British Novel, or an incident or episode from a British Novel. It is thus the exact artistic opposite of the American Short-story, of which, as we have seen, the chief characteristics are originality, ingenuity, compression, and, not infrequently, a touch of fantasy. I do not say, of course, that the good and genuine Short-story is not written in England now and then, — for if I were to make any such assertion some of the best work of Mr. Stevenson, of Mr. Besant, and of Mr. Anstey would rise up to contradict me; but this is merely an accidental growth, and not a staple of production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule, in England the artist in fiction does not care to hide his light under a bushel, and he puts his best work where it will be seen of all men, — that is to say, not in a Short-story. So it happens that the most of the brief tales in the British magazines are not true Short-stories at all, and that they belong to a lower form of the art of fiction, in the department with the amplified anecdote. It is the three-volume Novel which has killed the Short-story in England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain of the remarks in the present paper I put forth first anonymously in the columns of the &lt;em&gt;Saturday Review&lt;/em&gt;, of London. To my intense surprise, they were controverted in the &lt;em&gt;Nation&lt;/em&gt;, of New York. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [18]&lt;/sup&gt; The critic began by assuming that the writer had said that Americans preferred Short-stories to Novels. What had really been said was that there was a steady demand for Short-stories in American magazines, whereas in England the demand was rather for serial Novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; The original article will be found in the &lt;i&gt;Saturday Review&lt;/i&gt; for Sept. 4, 1884; and the adverse criticism appeared in the Nation for July 5, 1885.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the first place,&quot; said the critic, ''Americans do not prefer Short-stories, as is shown by the enormous number of British Novels circulated among us; and in the second place, tales of the quiet, domestic kind, which form the staple of periodicals like &lt;em&gt;All the Tear Round&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Chambers's Journal,&lt;/em&gt; have here thousands of readers where native productions, however clever and original, have only hundreds, since the former are reprinted by the country papers and in the Sunday editions of city papers as rapidly and regularly as they are produced at home.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the answer to this is simply that these British Novels and British stories are reprinted widely in the United States, not because the American people prefer them to anything else, but because, owing to the absence of international copyright, they cost nothing. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [19]&lt;/sup&gt; That the American people prefer to read American stories when they can get them is shown by the enormous circulation of the periodicals which make a speciality of American fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; It is pleasant to be able to remark that the copyright act of 1891 removed the premium of cheapness from the British tales, and that the American writer of Short-stories is no longer compelled to produce in competition with stolen goods.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find I have left myself little space to speak of the Short-story as it exists in other literatures than those of Great Britain and the United States. The conditions which have killed the Short-story in England do not obtain elsewhere; and elsewhere there are not a few good writers of Short-stories. Turgenef, Bjornsen, Sacher-Masoch, Freytag, Lindau, are the names which one recalls at once and without effort as masters in the art and mystery of the Short-story. Turgenef's Short-stories, in particular, it would be difficult to commend too warmly. But it is in France that the Short-story flourishes most abundantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In France the conditions are not unlike those in the United States; and, although there are few French magazines, there are many Parisian newspapers of a wide hospitality to literature. The demand for the Short-story has called forth an abundant supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the many excellent writers of the last generation who delighted in the &lt;em&gt;conte&lt;/em&gt; — which is almost the exact French equivalent for Short-story, as &lt;em&gt;nouvelle&lt;/em&gt; may be taken to indicate the story which is merely short, the episode, the incident, the amplified anecdote — were Alfred de Musset, Théophile Gautier, and Prosper Mérimée.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best work of Mérimée has never been surpassed. As compression was with him almost a mania, — as, indeed, it was with his friend Turgenef, — he seemed born on purpose to write Short-stories. Turgenef carried his desire for conciseness so far that he seems always to be experimenting to see how much of his story he may leave out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the foremost writers of &lt;em&gt;contes&lt;/em&gt; is Edmond About, whose charming humour is known to all readers of the 'Man with the Broken Ear' — a Short-story in conception, though unduly extended in execution. Few of the charming &lt;em&gt;contes&lt;/em&gt; of M. Alphonse Daudet, or of the earlier Short-stories of M. Émile Zola, have been translated into English; and the poetic tales of M. François Coppée are likewise unduly neglected in this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 'Abbé Constantin' of M. Ludovic Halevy has been read by many, but the Gallic satire of his more Parisian Short-stories has been passed by, perhaps wisely, in spite of their broad humour and their sharp wit. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [20]&lt;/sup&gt; In the very singular collection of stories which M. Jean Riche-pin has called the 'Morts Bizarres' we find a modern continuation of the Poe tradition, always more potent in France than elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; In the fifteen years since this essay was first printed, this reproach has been removed, and the best of the Short-stories of Daudet, of M. Coppée and of M. Halevy have been lovingly rendered into English by American translators.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Here I cancel a casual sentence written in 1885, before Guy de Maupassant had completely revealed his extraordinary gifts and his marvellous craftsmanship. His Short-stories are masterpieces of the art of story-telling, because he had a Greek sense of form, a Latin power of construction, and a French felicity of style. They are simple, most of them; direct, swift, inevitable, and inexorable in their straightforward movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If art consists in the suppression of non-essentials, there have been few greater artists in fiction than Maupassant. In his Short-stories there is never a word wasted, and there is never an excursus. Nor is there any feebleness or fumbling. What he wanted to do he did, with the unerring certainty of Leatherstocking, hitting the bull's-eye again and again. He had the abundance and the ease of the very great artists; and the half-dozen or the half-score of his best stories are among the very best Short-stories in any language]. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [21]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; In his later tales there is to be noted a tendency towards the psychology of the morbid. The thought of death and the dread of mental disease seemed to possess him. In ‘Le Horla,’ for example, we find Maupassant taking for his own Fitzjames O'Brien's uncanny monster, invisible and yet tangible and the Frenchman gave the tale an added touch of terror by making the unfortunate victim discover that the creature he feared had a stronger will than his own, and that he was being hypnotised to his doom by a being whom he could not see, but whose presence he could feel. O’Brien’s very startling tale, ‘What was it?’ is to be found in the volume of his Short-stories called &lt;i&gt;The Diamond &lt;/i&gt;Lens (New Yorks Scribner).
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-short-story--never-void-in-form--with-symmetry-of-design&quot;&gt;The Short-Story — Never Void in Form &amp;amp; With Symmetry of Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Short-story should not be void or without form, but its form may be whatever the author please. He has an absolute liberty of choice. It may be a personal narrative, like Poe's &lt;em&gt;Descent into the Maelstrom&lt;/em&gt;' or Mr. Hale's &lt;em&gt;My Double, and How He Undid M_e'; it may be impersonal, like Mr. Frederick B. Perkins's _Devil-Puzzlers&lt;/em&gt; or Colonel J. W. De Forest's &lt;em&gt;Brigade Commander&lt;/em&gt;; it may be a conundrum, like Mr. Stockton's insoluble query, the &lt;em&gt;Lady or the Tiger?&lt;/em&gt;, it may be &lt;em&gt;A Bundle of Letters&lt;/em&gt;, like Mr. Henry James's story, or &lt;em&gt;A Letter and a Paragraph&lt;/em&gt;, like Mr. Bunner's; it may be a medley of letters and telegrams and narrative, like Mr. Aldrich's &lt;em&gt;Margery Daw&lt;/em&gt;; it may be cast in any one of these forms, or in a combination of all of them, or in a wholly new form, if haply such may yet be found by diligent search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever its form, it should have symmetry of design. If it have also wit or humour, pathos or poetry, and especially a distinct and unmistakable flavour of individuality, so much the better. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [22]&lt;/sup&gt; But the chief requisites are compression, originality, ingenuity, and now and again a touch of fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; In a chatty and somewhat uncritical paper on the ‘Rise of the Short-story’ contributed by Mr. Bret Harte to the ‘International Library of Famous Literature' and published also in the &lt;i&gt;Cornhill Magazine&lt;/i&gt; for July, 1899, we find the assertion that the secret of the American Short-story is “the treatment of characteristic American life, with absolute knowledge of its peculiarities and sympathy with its methods, with no fastidious ignoring of its national expression, or the inchoate poetry that may be found hidden even in its slang with no moral determination except that which may be the legitimate outcome of the story itself; with no more elimination than may be necessary for the artistic conception, and never from the fear of the fetish of conventionalism.” This is cleverly phrased; but it is open to the obvious objection that it is not so much an adequate definition of the Short-story as a form as it is a defence of the special kind of Short-story Mr. Bret Harte himself has chosen to write.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we may detect the writer of Short-stories a tendency toward the over-elaboration of ingenuity, toward the exhibition of ingenuity for its own sake, as in a Chinese puzzle. But mere cleverness is incompatible with greatness, and to commend a writer as &quot;very clever&quot; is not to give him high praise. From this fault of supersubtlety, women are free for the most part. They are more likely than men to rely on broad human emotion, and their tendency in error is toward the morbid analysis of a high-strung moral situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-viii&quot;&gt;Chapter VIII&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-difference-between-the-novel-and-the-short-story--not-merely-one-of-length&quot;&gt;The Difference Between the Novel and the Short-story — Not Merely One of Length&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more carefully we study the history of fiction the more clearly we perceive that the Novel and the Short-story are essentially different — that the difference between them is not one of mere length only, but fundamental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Short-story seeks one set of effects in its own way, and the Novel seeks a wholly distinct set of effects in a wholly distinct way. We are led also to the conclusion that the Short-story — in spite of the fact that in our language it has no name of its own — is one of the few sharply defined literary forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a genre, as M. Brunetiere terms it, a species, as a naturalist might call it, as individual as the Lyric itself and as various. It is as distinct an entity as the Epic, as Tragedy, as Comedy. Now the Novel is not a form of the same sharply defined individuality; it is — or at least it may be — anything. It is the child of the Epic and the heir of the Drama; but it is a hybrid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one of the foremost of living American novelists, who happens also to be one of the most acute and sympathetic of American critics, has told me that he was often distracted by the knowledge of this fact even while he was engaged in writing a novel. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [23]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; This paragraph and the one following were not in the original essay.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the history of literature the Short-story was developed long before the Novel, which indeed is but a creature of yesterday, and which was not really established in popular esteem as a worthy rival of the drama until after the widespread success of the Waverley Novels in the early years of the nineteenth century. The Short-story also seems much easier of accomplishment than the Novel, if only because it is briefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet the list of the masters of the Short-story is far less crowded than the list of the masters of the longer form. There are a score or more very great novelists recorded in the history of fiction; but there are scarcely more than half a score Short-story writers of an equal eminence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Chaucer and Boccaccio we must spring across the centuries until we come to Hawthorne and Poe almost without finding another name that insists upon enrolment. In these five hundred years there were great novelists not a few, but there was no great writer of Short-stories. A little later than Hawthorne and Poe, and indeed almost contemporaneous with them, are Mérimée and Turgenef, whose title to be recorded there is none to dispute. Now at the end of the nineteenth century we find two more that no competent critic would dare to omit, — Guy de Maupassant and Rudyard Kipling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;appendix&quot;&gt;Appendix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far as the author is aware, he had no predecessor in asserting that the Short-story differs from the Novel essentially, — and not merely in the matter of length. So far as he knows, it was in the present paper the suggestion was first made that the Short-story is in reality a genre, a separate kind, a genus by itself. But although this distinction may not have been made explicitly by any earlier critic, there is little doubt that Poe felt it, even if he did not formulate it in set terms. It seems to be implicit in more than one of his critical essays, more particularly in that on 'Hawthorne's Tales.' And it is from this essay that the following quotations are taken:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The ordinary novel is objectionable from its length, for reasons already stated in substance. As it cannot be read at one sitting, it deprives itself, of course, of the immense force derivable from totality. Worldly interests intervening during the pauses of perusal modify, annul, or contract, in a greater or less degree, the impressions of the book. But simply cessation in reading would, of itself, be sufficient to destroy the true unity. In the brief tale, however, the author is enabled to carry out the fulness of his intention, be it what it may. During the hour of perusal the soul of the reader is at the writer's control. There are no external or extrinsic influences — resulting from weariness or interruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A skilful literary artist has constructed a tale. If wise, he has not fashioned his thoughts to accommodate his incidents; but having conceived, with deliberate care, a certain unique or single effect to be wrought out, he then invents such incidents — he then combines such events as may best aid him in establishing this preconceived effect. If his very initial sentence tend not to the out-bringing of this effect, then he has failed in his first step. *  &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt; [24]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the whole composition there should be no word written of which the tendency, direct or indirect, is not to the one pre-established design. As by such means, with such care and skill, a picture is at length painted which leaves in the mind of him who contemplates it with a kindred art a sense of the fullest satisfaction. The idea of the tale has been presented unblemished, because undisturbed; and this is an end unattainable by the novel. Undue brevity is just as exceptionable here as in the poem; but undue length is yet more to be avoided.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;
 &lt;sup class=&quot;sup_red&quot;&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; It is interesting to compare what Poe says here with Stevenson’s statement of the same principle already quoted in the note on page 15.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although no later essay has added much to our knowledge of the essential nature of the Short-story and of unnecessary characteristics, the reader may be glad to have collected here references to other attempts to deal with the subject. The most elaborate is &lt;em&gt;Short-story Writing&lt;/em&gt; by Mr. Charles Raymond Barrett, Ph.B. (New York: The Baker and Taylor Co., 1900); of which an earlier edition had been issued by the Chicago Authors' and Writers' Union. To a little book &lt;em&gt;On the Art of Writing Fiction&lt;/em&gt; (London: Wells, Gardner Dart on &amp;amp; Co. 1895), the authoress of &lt;em&gt;Mademoiselle Ixe&lt;/em&gt; contributed a chapter on the Short-story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to write a Short-story&lt;/em&gt; is the general title given to four rather personal papers by Mr. Robert Barr, Mr. Harold Frederic, Mr. Arthur Morrison, and Miss Jane Barlow, contributed to the American edition of &lt;em&gt;The Bookman&lt;/em&gt; for March, 1897. To be recorded also are articles by Mr. Frederick Wedmore in the &lt;em&gt;Nineteenth Century&lt;/em&gt; for March, 1898, and by Mr. Bret Harte in the &lt;em&gt;Cornhill Magazine&lt;/em&gt; for July, 1899, from each of which quotation has been made in the notes on the preceding pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Professor Harry Thurston Peck's exhaustive historical and critical Introduction to his vigorous and racy translation of the masterpiece of Petronius, &lt;em&gt;Trimalchio's Dinner&lt;/em&gt; (New York: Dodd, Mead &amp;amp; Co., 1898) there is casual mention of the Short-story as it emerges fitfully into view in Greek literature (p. 16), and in Latin (p. 40.) And in this same Introduction, Professor Peck has translated what is probably the most famous Short-story classical antiquity has bequeathed to us, &lt;em&gt;The Matron of Ephesus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidental discussion of the Short-story (as a form) will be found in Mr. Henry James's papers on Daudet and Maupassant and Stevenson in his &lt;em&gt;Partial Portraits&lt;/em&gt; (New York and London : Macmillan &amp;amp; Co.), and in my own essays on the &lt;em&gt;contes&lt;/em&gt; of M. Francois Coppée and of M. Ludovic Halevy in &lt;em&gt;Aspects of Fiction&lt;/em&gt; (New York: Harper &amp;amp; Brothers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my Introduction to Irving's &lt;em&gt;Tales of a Traveler&lt;/em&gt; prepared for &lt;em&gt;Longman's English classics&lt;/em&gt; (edited by Professor G. R. Carpenter), there is an examination of Irving's methods and of his mastery in this difficult department of the art of narrative. There is also a brief but admirable essay by Mr. Henry Harland in the London Academy for June 5th, 1897.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting international comparison can be had by setting side by side the specimens of this art contained in three series, of ten volumes each, published by Chas. Scribner's Sons: &lt;em&gt;Stories by American Authors&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stories by English Authors&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stories by Foreign Authors&lt;/em&gt;. The second series had better have been called &lt;em&gt;Stories by British Authors&lt;/em&gt;, since it contained also the work of Scotchmen and Irishmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English and Foreign series are each representative of the best the authors of the several countries have to show; but the American series — excellent as it is — does not thus present the pick of American Short-story writing, since the editor limited his own freedom of choice by selecting from the magazines only those stories which the authors had not yet replevined for volumes of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE END&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
Mr. Besant's lecture was published in a pamphlet (London: Chatto and Windus). Mr. James's essay may be found in his 'Partial Portraits' (London and New York: Macmillan Sc Co). Mr. Stevenson's 'Humble Remonstrance,' as well as his cognate 'Gossip on Romance,' are included in the volume called 'Memories and Portraits' (New York : Scribner; London: Chatto and Windus). The substance of Mr. Howells' s doctrines can be found succinctly set forth in his little book called 'Criticism and Fiction' (New York : Harper &amp;amp; Brothers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
In a letter to a friend, Stevenson lays down the law with his usual directness: &quot;Make another end to it? Ah, yes, but that's not the way I write; the whole tale is implied; I never use an effect when I can help it, unless it prepares the effects that are to follow; that's what a story consists in. To make another end, that is to make the beginning all wrong. The dénouement of a long story is nothing, it is just 'a full close,' which you may approach and accompany as you please — it is a coda, not an essential member in the rhythm; but the body and end of a short-story is bone of the bane and blood of the blood of the beginning.&quot; &lt;em&gt;Vailima Letters&lt;/em&gt;, vol. i., p. 147.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
See his essay on 'The Philosophy of Composition,' to be found in the sixth volume of the collected edition of his works, prepared by Messrs. Stedman and Woodberry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
In an essay on 'The Local Short-story' contributed to the &lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt; for March n, 1892, Colonel T. W. Higginson points out the disadvantages the novelist labours under when he knows that his work is to be published in instalments; and he declares that this possible serial publication &quot;affords the justification of the short-story. For here, at least, we have the conditions of perfect art; there is no sub-division of interest; the author can strike directly in, without preface, can move with determined step toward a conclusion, and can — O highest privilege! — stop when he is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most perfect examples of the short-story — those of De Maupassant, for instance — the reader feels, if he can pause to think, that they must have been done at a sitting, so complete is the grasp, the single grasp, upon the mind. This completeness secures the end; they need not be sensational, because there is no necessity of keeping up a series of exciting minor incidents; the main incident is enough. Around the very centre of motion, as in a whirlwind, there may be a perfect quiet, a quiet which is formidable in its very repose. In De Maupassant's terrific story of Corsican vengeance, 'Une Vendetta,' in which the sole actor is a lonely old woman who trains a fierce dog so that he ultimately kills her enemy, the author simply tells us, at the end, that this quiet fiend of destruction went peacefully home and went to sleep. Elle dormit bien, cette nuit-là. The cyclone has spent itself, and the silence it has left behind it is more formidable than the cyclone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
This critical paper of Trollope's on 'The Genius of Nathaniel Hawthorne' was contributed to the &lt;em&gt;North American Review&lt;/em&gt; for September, 1879. Apparently, like many other of his essays, it has not been reprinted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
In some rambling notes on &quot;The Short-story&quot; contributed to the &lt;em&gt;Nineteenth Century&lt;/em&gt; for March, 1898, Mr. Frederick Wedmore reiterates certain of the points made in this essay. For one thing, he declares that a good Short-story can never be 'a novel in a nut-shell'; it &quot;cannot possibly be a &lt;em&gt;pr &lt;strong&gt;é&lt;/strong&gt; cis&lt;/em&gt;, a synopsis, a &lt;em&gt;scenario&lt;/em&gt;, as it were, of a novel. It is a separate thing — as separate, almost, as the Sonnet is from the Epic, — it involves the exercise almost of a different art.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
This difference is considered briefly by Mr. F. B. Perkins in the characteristically clever preface to the volume of his ingenious Short-stories, which takes its title from the first and best — 'Devil-Puzzlers' (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
In the narrow but suggestive biography of Hawthorne contributed to Mr. John Morley's 'English Men of Letters.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
In his review of Hawthorne's earlier tales, contributed originally to &lt;em&gt;Graham's Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, and to be consulted now in the seventh volume of the critical edition prepared by Messrs. Stedman and Woodberry. It is both interesting and instructive to compare this article on Hawthorne in which Poe vaunts the superiority of the Short-story over the Novel, with the paper on the 'Philosophy of Composition,' in which he makes a similar claim for the Lyric over the Epic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
For example, it is not unfair to suggest that all the manifold feats of Dr. Conan Doyle's very clever 'Sherlock Holmes' are latent in one or another of these tales of Poe's, — M. Dupin being the prototype of Holmes himself, and the autobiographic narrator standing in the same attitude of wondering admiration that Dr. Watson takes in the British series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
In his very suggestive study of Poe in 'New Essays toward a critical method,' Mr. J. M. Robertson quotes from the Spanish critic Landa the statement that Poe &quot;has been the first story-writer to exploit the field of science in the department of the marvelous;&quot; and he has further been the first &quot;to exploit the marvellous in morbid psychology with scientific art&quot; (p. 103).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
It is to be regretted that Lowell's acute criticism of Poe is not to be found in the complete edition of his own works, but only in an early and incomplete edition of Poe's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
The reader may be reminded once more that this essay was written in 1885. Although these absurd assertions were not infrequent then, they are unknown now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
It Is not without Interest to recall the fact that Irving's 'Sketch Book' was the earliest work of American authorship to gain popularity in Great Britain, and that it originally appeared in parts in 1819-10, — the very first part containing 'Rip van Winkle,' a perfect specimen of the American Short-story with its delightful blending of fantasy and humour. And in a letter written to a friend in New York shortly after the publication of the 'Tales of a Traveler,' in 1814, Irving pointed out, with equal shrewdness and modesty, the reasons why the Short-story seemed to him more difficult than the Novel, and also discussed his own method of composition. ('Life and Letters of Washington Irving.' New York; G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1869, vol. ii. p. 117.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
In the article from which a quotation has already been made (in a note on pp. 21, xx), Colonel Higginson called attention to the skill with which the local short-story in the hands of innumerable writers of both sexes in all parts of the United States has been made to yield the very form and colour of every section of our immense country and he remarks that &quot;the rapid multiplication of the portable kodak has scarcely surpassed the swift growth of local writers, each apparently having the same equipment of directness and vigor. All the varied elements of our society are being rapidly sought out and exhibited. To begin on the soil longest wrought. Miss Wilkins has produced a series of moral pictures, as true and as terse as anything in literature, though she has, unhappily, left rather out of sight the more cultivated and ancestral aspects of New England life, to which, however, Miss Jewett has done ampler justice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
Since this was written the Short-stories of R. L. Stevenson and of Mr. Kipling have proved again how dangerous it is to generalise from special conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
It is satisfactory to record now that the three-volume system has disappeared at last, and finally, in the years that have elapsed since this paragraph was originally penned. Its extinction moved Mr. Rudyard Kipling to chant its requiem in a series of satirical stanzas, called 'The Three-Decker,' and now to be found with his other later lyrics in 'The Seven Seas.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
The original article will be found in the &lt;em&gt;Saturday Review&lt;/em&gt; for Sept. 4, 1884; and the adverse criticism appeared in the &lt;em&gt;Nation&lt;/em&gt; for July 5, 1885.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
It is pleasant to be able to remark that the copyright act of 1891 removed the premium of cheapness from the British tales, and that the American writer of Short-stories is no longer compelled to produce in competition with stolen goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
In the fifteen years since this essay was first printed, this reproach has been removed, and the best of the Short-stories of Daudet, of M. Coppée and of M. Halevy have been lovingly rendered into English by American translators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
In his later tales there is to be noted a tendency towards the psychology of the morbid. The thought of death and the dread of mental disease seemed to possess him. In 'Le Horla,' for example, we find Maupassant taking for his own Fitzjames O'Brien's uncanny monster, invisible and yet tangible and the Frenchman gave the tale an added touch of terror by making the unfortunate victim discover that the creature he feared had a stronger will than his own, and that he was being hypnotised to his doom by a being whom he could not see, but whose presence he could feel. O'Brien's very startling tale, 'What was it?' is to be found in the volume of his Short-stories called &lt;em&gt;The Diamond Lens&lt;/em&gt; (New Yorks Scribner).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#
In a chatty and somewhat uncritical paper on the 'Rise of the Short-story' contributed by Mr. Bret Harte to the 'International Library of Famous Literature' and published also in the &lt;em&gt;Cornhill Magazine&lt;/em&gt; for July, 1899, we find the assertion that the secret of the American Short-story is &quot;the treatment of characteristic American life, with absolute knowledge of its peculiarities and sympathy with its methods, with no fastidious ignoring of its national expression, or the inchoate poetry that may be found hidden even in its slang with no moral determination except that which may be the legitimate outcome of the story itself; with no more elimination than may be necessary for the artistic conception, and never from the fear of the fetish of conventionalism.&quot; This is cleverly phrased; but it is open to the obvious objection that it is not so much an adequate definition of the Short-story as a form as it is a defence of the special kind of Short-story Mr. Bret Harte himself has chosen to write.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;It is interesting to compare what Poe says here with Stevenson's statement of the same principle already quoted in the note on page 15.&lt;/li&gt;

        <summary type="html">In the final ten years of the nineteenth century an increasing attention has been paid to the history of fiction and to the principles of narrative art. In many of the leading American universities the modern novel has been serving as the subject for lectures and as the material for private study, in the course of which the Short-story received a fair share of consideration.</summary>

&lt;p&gt;Several paragraphs in that portion of the following discussion which treats of the relation between the Short Story and the novel, are quoted, with some alteration, from an article in &quot;The Dial of October 16th, 1901,&quot; in which I approached this particular differentiation with a narrower view than the one which I have endeavored to take in this essay. For very helpful suggestions, valuable criticism, and kind encouragement in this attempt to define the Short Story, I wish especially to thank Professor Wilbur L. Cross. I am indebted, also, to Professor Albert S. Cook, Professor Charles S. Baldwin, and to other members of the Yale faculty for enlightening criticism, and to Mr. Chauncey B. Tinker for help in reading proof. I shall be deeply gratified if this investigation contributes in the slightest degree to a clearer conception of a very interesting literary form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all criticism there may be distinguished a literary algebra which, by the use of a word or a phrase for a development or a tendency, greatly facilitates thinking and writing. 'Sentimentalism,' 'preraphaelite,' 'impressionistic,' are such words, and very useful, although almost defying exact definition. 'Sentimentalism' now stands for a much wider range of ideas than the early eighteenth century would have found in it, and in a like manner the simple term 'short story' seems to have taken to itself a meaning only partially indicated by the adjective 'short.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of clearness in language, it is essential that the use of this expression as a symbol should first be made clear, and then justified. Such is the purpose of this discussion, and the attempt will demand a clear statement of that which differentiates the Short Story from the novel and the narrative which happens to be short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this last extensive genus I will henceforth use the word 'tale,' and keep 'Short Story' for a subdivision, perhaps a distinct nineteenth century development, which will show not only that literary individuality which any careful reader must feel, but definable qualities as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-i&quot;&gt;Chapter I&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-origins--history-of-the-short-story&quot;&gt;The Origins &amp;amp; History of the Short Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tales, short narratives, usually of one episode, have of course existed since man first felt the need of turning actual or imagined happening into words. Their development from the stories of the Egyptian papyri, or the fables of Pilpai, or whatever beginning you are pleased to take, has been that of narrative in general, and in each literary period before the nineteenth century the short story differs from the long principally in the matter of length, although a didactic purpose, which will be found much more frequently in the briefer variety, may cause some divergence in the selection and use of incident. But, as a rule, one takes an episode, the other ten, or condensation makes the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to select among the famous tales of past times a few which will be typical. The 'Cupid and Psyche' of &lt;em&gt;The Golden Ass of Apuleius&lt;/em&gt;, is perhaps the best example of the classic, and 'Ruth' of the Biblical. For one type of the mediaeval 'The Patient Griselda' of the &lt;em&gt;Decameron&lt;/em&gt;, and for another &lt;em&gt;Amis et Amile&lt;/em&gt; will be representative; and, of a very different nature, that tale of the courtesan, and the hypocritical scholar and the spendthrift, her prey, in &lt;em&gt;Green's A Groat's Worth of Witte__for a Million of Repentance&lt;/em&gt;, of the late sixteenth century, will stand for that period. Do these differ in genus from longer stories of their times, from &lt;em&gt;Daphnis and Chloe&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;em&gt;Reynard the Fox&lt;/em&gt;, from the prose romances of chivalry, from Nashe's &lt;em&gt;Jack Wilton&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scarcely, for they are all simple narrative, designed first of all to tell a story. In one case the plot is slighter, or perhaps there is but one main episode, or there is condensation, and, seemingly, no other important distinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is illustrated by the story of Ruth, one of the best-told and most beautiful stories in literature. Naomi, with her daughter, returns out of the country of Moab into Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest. Ruth gleans in the fields of Boaz, her kinsman, and gains his love. He marries her, and so ends the story. This is simple narrative, which, aping history, purports to select from the events which are supposed to have happened all those necessary to give a true account of the episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of the perfect unity of the story, this method might readily be continued, in such a way that our tale, without change, should become the first chapter in a longer narrative, which, supposing for an instant that the contemporary novel were in question, would take a different and a wider view, and illustrate very probably the evil results of such a hasty marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot of 'Cupid and Psyche' is more extensive than that of 'Ruth,' and covers a greater period of time, but it, too, is a simple product of selection on the author's part from a certain amount of imagined incident. If he had cut out less, or added more episodes, the story would have been a long one; thus the actual tale is merely a condensation of a hypothetical narrative of greater length. Successful condensation, to be sure, requires an art of its own, a very nice choice of incident and a very efficient setting forth of character, but this is scarcely enough to supply a dividing line between the long story and the short tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor is it possible to foist a definition upon the intrigue stories, the novelle and the fabliaux of the Middle Ages, and say when they differ from an incident, let us say, in a picaresque novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Patient Griselda&lt;/em&gt; of Boccaccio the treatment is not altogether natural; character, atmosphere, and verisimilitude are sacrificed to the action, and even the conception of a long-suffering woman serves principally to make the plot go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The friendship of Amis and Amile is a like impelling force, and there are dozens of stories in the &lt;em&gt;Decameron&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Gesta Romanorum&lt;/em&gt; and like collections which are skeletons merely. But pad out with details, construct an extension at either end, and you have a novel of the Smollett type without change of form. Select certain 'dovetailable' stories from the &lt;em&gt;Decameron&lt;/em&gt;, clip off the first and last paragraphs, normalize the principal characters, and you can obtain a structure with a notable resemblance to certain portions of Gil Bias, or Humphry Clinker, minus the general reflections. The tale in a &lt;em&gt;Groat's Worth of Wit&lt;/em&gt;, thus treated, could easily be smuggled into &lt;em&gt;Jack Wilton&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has been said of 'Ruth' will apply to the eighteenth century tale, although the short narratives which are to be found scattered through the pages of the &lt;em&gt;Spectator&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, and other periodical publications of the age, may be noted as partial exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These stones, as Mr. Walter Morris Hart points out in his &lt;em&gt;Hawthorne and the Short Story&lt;/em&gt;, are a development of the periodical essay. They are intended to illustrate concretely what the essay might fail to explain as well by general exposition. Upon this assumption he proceeds to derive the Short Story from the periodical essay, and with his conclusion I shall have to do later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the point to be emphasized here is that while these stories are intended to make an explanation more telling, and therefore have a purpose beyond that of simple narrative, they may be detached from their context, and this purpose excluded. They become then simple tales, although the selection of incident will here lead toward the exposition of the point to be made, just as in the intrigue stories it favors the development of the plot. So with Christ's parables, or the moralized beast-tales, and with all fables which, throughout the ages, have been told with a more or less didactic purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These eighteenth century stories are all more or less of the same type, but they constitute no new development in literature. To select a few at random, the 'Letter from Octavia Complaining of the Ingratitude of Her Husband,' which is No. 322 of the &lt;em&gt;Spectator&lt;/em&gt;, is a good example, whose text is the inadvisability of marrying a man above you, as that of the 'Letter from Sir John Envil, married to a Woman of Quality,' No. 299 in the same periodical, is the inconvenience of marrying a woman of greater rank than yourself. Both of these, apart from their explanatory introduction, are simple tales requiring no moral reflection, just as 'Ruth' does not require that one should say, at the end, 'this shows that one should be humble in mind.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tales always tend to run beyond that which is necessary for the argument. 'The Story of Theodosius and Constantine,' No. 164 of the &lt;em&gt;Spectator&lt;/em&gt;, is such a narrative, and Dr. Langhorne expanded this into a collection of letters filling two volumes. Indeed, these tales may be easily fitted into, or abstracted from, the longer stories of the time. You cannot precisely cut up the &lt;em&gt;Vicar of Wakefield&lt;/em&gt; into a certain number of &lt;em&gt;Spectator&lt;/em&gt; stories, because the Vicar is a novel, and there are certain differences in structure and treatment, but it is possible to extract a number of tales therefrom, leaving a residue of piecing and filling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such tale would be the trip to the fair, in which Moses bought a gross of green spectacles; another the intrigue between Olivia and Mr. Thornhill; the story of George Primrose's travels would be still another; and, by selection and condensation, enough narratives to furbish out many spectators could easily be provided, while the moral reflections to precede them might be found in the same text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, then, there would seem to be no generic distinction in narrative before the nineteenth century other than narrative short and long, tales of many episodes and tales of one, with a partial exception for fables and such didactic tales, and with this qualification, that in the best of the shorter variety there is usually a certain husbandry of words and choice of incident which indicates a consciousness of the necessity of doing a great deal in a little space. It is partly this realization, with a conception of the power of brevity, that has led to the mechanical development of the Short Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If what has been said so far be taken to indicate that the ancient family of tales possesses no fundamental distinction except length, and sometimes a certain point of view, to set apart its members from narrative in general, then, in order to discover any originality in the Short Story, it is necessary to find a real difference between 'Ruth,' a 'Roger de Coverley' paper, or 'Isabella and the Pot of Basil,' and 'A Lodging for the Night,' 'The Ship that Found Herself,' or 'The Real Thing.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference is easily felt by the reader, but the question remains, is it merely mechanical and due to a more dramatic structure, or is it of deeper origin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early part of this century, Irving began the publication of short tales possessing greater merit than any hitherto produced here. These stories were modeled, presumably, upon some of the &lt;em&gt;Spectator&lt;/em&gt; papers, and resemble them in form. They are tales still, in that their purpose is simple narrative, but in careful workmanship and conscious art they more closely approximate to the modern Short Story form. Irving's attitude toward the children of his fancy could not have been far different from that of Boccaccio or Chaucer. He says, in his introduction to the &lt;em&gt;Tales of a Traveler&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;'For my part, I consider a story merely as a frame upon which to stretch my materials. It is the play of thought, and sentiment, and language; the weaving in of characters. lightly, yet expressively delineated; the familiar and faithful exhibition of scenes in common life; and the half-concealed vein of humor that is often playing through the whole — these are among what I aim at, and upon which I felicitate myself in proportion as I think I succeed.'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us take a story, 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,' which is an excellent result of such a process, and compare it with Hawthorne's 'The White Old Maid,' a Short Story in which the element I wish to bring forward is slightly exaggerated, and therefore well-fitted to our purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,' like 'Ruth,' is a story of a simple episode, although, in the complicated plot, the emphasis placed upon the denouement, and the vivid description, it betrays much more conscious art. But what is the impression of the reader? It can scarcely be called an impression, although there will be distinct pictures arising from the vividness of the narrative; it will rather be a memory of a series of events, and to produce such a record is the aim of simple narrative. What machinery there is in the story consists mainly of devices to emphasize certain portions, to create an atmosphere, and to catch and hold the interest in the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast now with this 'The White Old Maid.' Very briefly, the plot is as follows: Two young women sit in a mysterious room beside the dead body of a youth they have both loved. There has been mysterious wrong done to him, now dead, and the guilty one — the dark girl by his bedside — is to do penance through suffering in the world before she may come back to that room to be forgiven. Years pass, the ancient house without inhabitant falls into gloomy disrepair; in the town a mysterious woman, robed in white, follows for a generation each funeral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day she appears without her accustomed cause, knocks on the ancient doorway of the deserted house, and, to the confounding of the townsfolk, is admitted. A coach rolls up the street, upon its panels emblazoned the arms of a family whose last representative has just died abroad. An old woman descends, and also enters the mysterious house. After a while there is a shriek heard from within, and when the aged minister, with one of the townspeople bolder than the rest, has made his way in, and up to the strange chamber, there is the White Old Maid just at the point of death, and they are too late to learn her secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, too, is a story, in the sense that something happens; and yet the real story, by which I mean the narrative which would logically connect and develop these events, is just hinted at, and is not very important. It is subordinated, indeed, to a new aim. 'The White Old Maid' is narrative for a purpose, and this purpose is to suggest an impression, and to leave us with a vivid sensation rather than a number of remembered facts. In short, it is contrived, not to leave a record of such and such an old woman who did this or that, but rather to stamp upon our minds the impression of a mystery-haunted house, mysterious figures entering, strange words, and a terrible sorrow behind all. Toward such a result the structure of the plot, every bit of description, every carefully chosen word, directly tends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no rambling, leisurely narrative like that of 'Sleepy Hollow,' nor digressions, nor a natural sequence of events such as might be expected in real life. The spell of the end is over every word and every choice of incident. It is this, which, for want of a less abused word, may be called impressionism, that is characteristic to some extent of all typical Short Stories, and serves as the most fundamental distinction between them and the earlier tales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going further, it is well to try to answer the question of source which naturally arises here, and, without dipping far into a historical inquiry, it is possible to hazard a hypothesis. It is evident that following the line of influence of the &lt;em&gt;Spectator&lt;/em&gt; papers through Irving we discover and can account for a well modeled, carefully written, thoroughly artistic tale. This would and does account for much in the form of Hawthorne's stories. It is as easy to turn to the romantic school of Germany for the new elements which are to be discerned in this story of 'The White Old Maid,' and in much more of his work. In the mystical, rhapsodical writings of that school we cannot fail to be impressed by much that is characteristic of Hawthorne, and of Poe as well. Tieck is more like Hawthorne than is any American writer; Hoffmann's characters, particularly in 'Master Martin,' powerfully suggest the half real, symbolistic figures of Hawthorne's creation. In the introduction to &lt;em&gt;Serapionsbrüder&lt;/em&gt;, Hoffmann formulates a method which was often Hawthorne's, and is certainly that of many impressionistic, modern short stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;At least,&quot; he says, &quot;let each one of us (the Brethren who are to tell the tales) strive earnestly and truly to grasp the image that has arisen in his mind in all its features, its colors, its lights and its shades, and then, when he feels himself really enkindled by them, let him proceed to embody them in an external description.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the resemblance of 'Feathertop' to the'Vogelscheuche' of Tieck has been often pointed out, and many another resemblance. But none of this proves the direct debt of the Short Story to the Germans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawthorne learned to read German, with difficulty, in 1843 — that is, after much of his best work had been published. There were translations of a few of Tieck's tales, to be sure, by 1825, but the best were not chosen, and it is not to be assumed that Havdhorne ever saw them. As for 'Vogelscheuche,' it was published in 1835, but in the Berliner &lt;em&gt;Novellenkranz&lt;/em&gt;, an 'annual,' and Hawthorne could not possibly have read it until after its inclusion in the &lt;em&gt;Novellensainmlung&lt;/em&gt; in 1842.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the suggestion for the story is included among the many in the American Note-Books, and dated 1840. Schonbach, whose critical knowledge of the Germans and the American gives him an authoritative word, sums the matter up very definitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Aber, wie Poe glaubte,' he says, 'und seither mit ausdauer nachge- schrieben wird, dass Tieck Hawthorne's muster gewesen und von ihm nachgebildet worden sei, das ist mir schon aus diesem inneren grunde hochst unwahrscheinlich.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In English: &quot;But how Poe believed and has since been registered with endurance justified that Tieck Hawthorne's was pattern and been imitated by him, that is me already out of this inner grunde highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This from his 'Beitriige zur Charakteristik Nathaniel Hawthorne's' in Englische Studien, in which he reasons the matter from internal as wrell as external evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To trace an influence is always difficult, and here the result seems particularly doubtful. The Germans of the Romantic School felt much as Hawthorne, and wrote somewhat like him, or he like them; that is about as far as it is safe to go. The truth of the matter seems to be that this indefinable and indefinite element of romanticism seems to have been in the air of this period, in Germany, in England, and in America, and Hawthorne perhaps derived his mysticism, his fondness for the unreal, his susceptibility to impressions, much as Wordsworth did his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, in many of Wordsworth's poems impressionistic motives analogous to those which can be traced in most Short Stories are at the root of the writing. 'The Yew Trees,' 'I wandered lonely as a cloud,' perhaps 'To a Highland Girl,' and many another, show such an origin; and Keats and other poets of the period will immediately suggest themselves as companions, and to be classed with Wordsworth in this respect. Think for an instant of the cause and effect of the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn.' This phase of romanticism was in the air, then, and Hawthorne may have absorbed some of it with the Spenser, common food of all romanticists, which he read in his youth. No doubt, too, there was some leaking of German influence to help the matter on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the attempt to create an impression through narrative was not thoroughly successful in Germany. The tales of Tieck, and particularly of Hoffmann, are too often formless, rambling, without unity. They arise often enough from impressions, and are intended to convey them. Indeed, in the case of Hoffmann, we have sometimes the history of the actual impression to compare with the story which resulted. But these stories are not good Short Stories, because they do not confine themselves to one unified purpose; they have many of them a motive akin to that of 'The White Old Maid,' but they lack the architectonics necessary to convey it. The best stories of these authors will be found thus deficient — such tales as those in the Serapiotisbriider, Tieck's 'The Goblet' or 'The Fair Haired Eckhard.' Fouque's &lt;em&gt;Undine&lt;/em&gt; is structurally better designed to gain the end of an impression, but this is a comparatively long story, and the impression the very broad one of the mystery of nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Hawthorne, saturated with the same spirit, susceptible as they to the impressions which nature, character, strange incongruities, horrible fancies, made upon his imagination, had at his command the well-ordered instrument which Irving and his literary forefathers had been polishing for their needs; and the use he made of it is largely responsible for the Short Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theory has very little to do with the history of impressionism, and does not assert that Hawthorne was among the first of the impressionists, nor, indeed, that a Short Story writer is a so-called impressionist at all, since that word seems to possess a dangerous variety of meanings. But Hawthorne's story, it seems, is intended to suggest a picture to the mind of the reader, or produce an impression upon it, which will resemble that vivid one which either actually or in imagination the writer received when the combination of the mysterious figure and the strange old house, full of gloomy suggestions, left its record upon his mind. Indeed, to convey this seems to be the main purpose of his writing, and, throughout, the story is constructed to convey such an effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe had such an attempt in mind in his work; he expresses it in his criticism of the New Englander's stories: &quot;If his very initial sentence tend not to the outbringing of this effect, then he has failed in his first step.&quot; This 'preconceived effect' may be regarded as the impression which the author wishes to convey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the nucleus of 'The Luck of Roaring Camp' may have been the glimpse of a lank, rough figure, with a tiny baby in its arms, and, in spite of the excellent plot, a feeling akin to the pleasurable emotion which would follow upon such a scene in real life remains longest with the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this theory the process, if one should attempt to write a Short Story, might be something like this: I leave my room and meet a drunken beggar reeling from the gutter. As I turn to avoid him, he pulls himself together and quotes huskily a dozen lines of Virgil with a bow and a flourish, and stumbles off into the darkness. I make him into a story, and, be the plot what it may, the effect upon the reader that I shall strive for will be a vivid impression of incongruity, not far different from that which I felt when the drunkard turned scholar and relapsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all short stories can be analyzed back to their basic element as easily as this one may be built up, but with many the process is easy and obvious. Nearly every conté of Maupassant is a perfect example; his titles 'Fear,' 'Happiness,' 'The Coward,' would lead you to suspect as much. In the motifs and suggestions for stories, some utilized later, some not, which may be found in quantity scattered through Hawthorne's &lt;em&gt;American Note-Books&lt;/em&gt;, there is often enough such an impression noted at the moment of its inception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, in the &lt;em&gt;American Note-Books, II. 176&lt;/em&gt;, is &quot;The print in blood of a naked foot to be traced through the streets of a town,&quot; which seems to inspire 'Dr. Grimshaw's Secret,' and again, N.B. I. 13, &quot;In an old house a mysterious knocking might be heard on the wall, where had formerly been a doorway now bricked up,&quot; which is applied in 'Peter Goldthwaite's Treasure;' also, &quot;A stranger, dying, is buried; and after many years two strangers come in search of his grave and open it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Hawthorne inclined more often to moral, philosophical reflections for his beginnings, such as, 'To make one's own reflection in a mirror the subject of a story,' afterwards used in 'Monsieur de Miroir;' and then his stories become symbolistic tales, or didactic narratives, not partaking of the best qualities of the Short Story. The best of such tales, and yet not to be ranked as a typical Short Story, is 'The Great Stone Face.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kipling has written many stories motived by impressions, such as 'The Ship that Found Herself,' and 'The Mark of the Beast,' to take two very different stories. Indeed, nearly every collection of short stories may be drawn upon for examples. In Henry James' story, 'Flickerbridge,' which appeared in Scribner's for February, 1902, the action of the story can only be explained by the deep impression which the quaint, delightful lady of Flickerbridge makes upon the hero, which impression it is the intent of the author to convey to the reader; and so with many another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the commonest variety is not so simple. Stevenson's 'A Lodging for the Night,' Kipling's 'On the City Wall,' Bret Harte's 'The Outcasts of Poker Flat,' Maurice Hewlett's 'Madonna of the Peach Tree,' and perhaps a majority of the magazine stories of the day, preserve the old desire to tell a story well as an equal or the dominant motive, only modified by the attempt to convey that impression which was probably at the foundation of the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I venture to say that an imagined contrast, between the proud, God honoring, simple-minded seigneur, and the poor devil of a Villon, clever and rascally, was the starting point for 'A Lodging for the Night;' and perhaps a sight or a thought of such a group as that about the fire in 'The Outcasts,' the pure and the stained, the reprobate and the innocent, all under the spell of a common peril, was the germ of that great story. But in each case the plot is highly developed, and by no means entirely aims at these single effects, although in each case they are probably sought as the sum of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This subdivision will naturally suggest what is known as the 'character sketch,' a form of the Short Story in which again there is another element besides that of pure impressionism. Take, for instance, Verga's 'Jeli the Shepherd,' a story of a simple herd-boy of good instincts, fostered by close association with nature, a love like hero-worship, and a mind slow to admit new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story tells how he loves and marries Mara; and when the knowledge comes to him that she is false, he merely works on stupidly until one day the realization comes, he sees her with her lover, and a man's throat is cut. This story is psychological, it deals with character exposition, but it approaches it through an impression; the attempt is first of all to make the reader feel this simple herd-boy's mental make-up and personality, and then, by added incident, fact, and explanation, appeal to the reason, that the impression may be explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of Miss Wilkins' New England stories are similarly constructed. Worn old women, pale girls with colorless ideals — Maupassant would be content with making us feel such types — and often, as in 'Arethusa' and most of her 'Understudies,' Miss Wilkins goes no further, for 'Arethusa' seems to be the working out of that feeling which one gets from a chance sight of a shy girl with the wild instincts of maidenhood in her eyes, and another, 'The Monkey,' the memory of a home-sick monkey reaching his little arms restlessly through the bars of his cage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the commoner type of character Short Story deals with an impression reinforced by psychological work, or motive-seeking, or thought-exposition, designed to appeal to the reason of the reader, to confirm and make more complete, more reasonable, the impression he has received from the story. Bjornson, Miss Jewett, Henry James, Turgenieff  — there are dozens who have written such stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Hart, in the article which I have already mentioned, feels evidently that a purpose ulterior to that of mere narrative is the characteristic quality of a Short Story, but he takes this purpose to be explanatory, and a proof, that an essay is in the family tree, say of the &lt;em&gt;Plain Tales from the Hills&lt;/em&gt;. The transition from the tales with a purpose of the &lt;em&gt;Spectator&lt;/em&gt;, which Irving imitated and Hawthorne studied, to the 'impression' story of the latter author, is not difficult, but the step is a long one, and originality can scarcely be denied to the latter form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What appeal the &lt;em&gt;Spectator&lt;/em&gt; tale makes, beyond that of its narrative, is to the intellect solely, while the first aim of the later stories of which I have been speaking is to make the reader feel that with which the writer was impressed. This point may be illustrated by a comparison of &lt;em&gt;Spectator&lt;/em&gt; paper No. 299, 'Letter from Sir John Envil, married to a Woman of Quality,' with Miss Jewett's story, 'David Berry.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first deals with 'those calamities and misfortunes which a weak man suffers from wrong measures and ill-concerted schemes of life,' that is, the danger arising from marrying a wife above his rank; the second with the downfall of a virtuous old shoemaker, brought about indirectly by his ambitious dame. I have quoted a line or so from the introduction in the &lt;em&gt;Spectator&lt;/em&gt; paper, and it is evident that this story began with an abstraction, a theory, which is dressed in narrative to enforce the point. But it is just as clear that 'David Berry' is first of all an idea, memory, or impression of this kindly old fellow, simple and honest and over-generous, and that the moral side, the lesson that one may learn, is merely the almost inevitable result which follows the working out of a character which would make such an impression upon us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One story works from the abstract forward, the other from the concrete backward. And thus the line of development of the Short Story from the essay source, while in part traceable, is sufficiently tenuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this impressionism, used strictly as defined, when combined with the other elements of a Short Story, seems to make for a new literary form, there is nevertheless much earlier writing with impressionistic tendencies. Sterne is full of it and the Sentimental Journey has a kind of impressionism as its most serious purpose. But the &lt;em&gt;Sentimental Journey&lt;/em&gt; lacks all the other qualifications of a Short Story. It rambles; it has no particular unity; it observes none of the rigid requirements which confine a Short Story to one incident, one main impression, and a unified, climactic development. It would be possible to select an episode such as that with the glove-merchant's wife, or the fille de chambre, which would have a considerable unity, but the impressions he chronicles here are slight ones, so slight that a graceful style, wit, and chance hits can convey them, and the narrative amounts to nothing, or is there for its own sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many poets, too, have been praised for, or accused of, impressionism, but, except in regard to sources, this is outside the inquiry, since it is with the Short Story as with the novel, its elements are to be found elsewhere, but it is their combination, and their development when so combined, which results in a form distinct from its antecedents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The particular terseness, vividness attained by choice of words, swift description, and speedy action characteristic of this modern story, are all naturally employed in the attempt to convey with sufficient force the impression which the author has received. In the simple narrative of the early tales these devices are utilized to some extent. But it is this new, or newly matured, purpose, which has brought to nicety that which may be called the machinery of the Short Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tell a tale well requires careful arrangement of events, a careful proportioning, careful adjustment of description and of narration, of character and action. But, by means of' this well told tale, to make a vivid impression of a mood, a character, an incongruity, a pathetic situation, or a strange companionship, as in the 'Brushwood Boy,' a still more careful art is necessary. Every word must count, and, for the sake of definite outline, everything not essential must be rigorously excluded. The result is a concise, narrative picture of something striking in events or in character, or in the union of the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose this process be applied to a tale which is to be told for the story simply, notably a tale with a reversal. Should this story be written with the terseness, the vivid action, the condensed description, the absolute unity and totality of the Short Story form, the result will be a vivid impression of the plot, and particularly of the reversal, but not an impression in precisely the sense which I have used before. Many modern stories may be included here, of which the ubiquitous detective story, best exemplified perhaps in Poe's 'The Purloined Letter,' is the most familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the tales with a reversal, a surprise at the end, we must look to work of a lighter mood. Some of H. C. Bunner's &lt;em&gt;Short Sixes&lt;/em&gt;, such a tale as Aldrich's &lt;em&gt;Margery Daw&lt;/em&gt;, and many familiar narratives, will be remembered and so classified. It is very difficult to find good Short Stories now in which some trace of the impressionistic element cannot be discovered, but those belonging to the class of 'The Purloined Letter' or &lt;em&gt;Margery Daw&lt;/em&gt; may be said to be tales, in the sense defined, built along the lines developed for the Short Story; and this highly perfected, very dramatic structure is largely a result of the attempt to convey an impression by narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-ii&quot;&gt;Chapter II&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;defining-the-modern-short-story--more-than-merely-poes-unity-of-impression&quot;&gt;Defining the Modern Short Story — More Than Merely Poe’s “Unity of Impression”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this hypothesis of impressionism may give us ground for believing that the Short Story contains elements which set it apart from the tale, even when its purpose is not mainly suggestive, yet it is not a sufficient answer to the interesting question of the relation of the Short Story to the novel. For it is obvious that this particular kind of suggestive purpose may figure largely in a novel, even when it is not classed among those commonly called impressionistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to take, say the river episode in 'The Ordeal of Richard Feverel,' where, as you remember, Richard Feverel, under romantic circumstances, saves his future betrothed from a ducking, and to say that Meredith wishes to convey to the reader a vivid impression of the conjunction of the fresh girl and the moody boy, whose spirit is tinder to her spark. If this is impressionistic, and there is no other distinction, then a Short Story may be merely an episode abstracted from a hypothetical novel; which is not the conclusion I intend to reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been said that unity of impression is the distinguishing point, and this, in a sense, is true, but as a definition it seems to lack precision. Poe used this phrase in argument, and thought mainly of the time-element. A tale could be read at a sitting; a novel must be read in gulps, as it were, of a handful of chapters each, and the impression which the unity of the tale should convey naturally suffers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the phrase seems to be used now with reference to the effect of the design of the narrative upon the reader, whether read in one sitting or a dozen. A single, vivid impression is to be the result of the Short Story, while many diverse yet harmonious impressions are to follow upon the reading of a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet surely many novels, such as George Eliot's &lt;em&gt;Romola&lt;/em&gt; or Meredith's &lt;em&gt;The__Egoist&lt;/em&gt;, leave a unified impression not entirely differing from that of the definition above. In the first, the degeneration of Tito Melema is not only the central thread, but the digest of the whole story; as in the other book is the egoism of Willoughby. Neither this quality, nor the unity gained by condensation, is a sufficient justification for the separate classification of the Short Story and the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another way of getting at this matter. The great difference between a poem, a historical essay, and a novel upon the same subject, lies in the point of view. The poem works through imagination and suggestion. The history deals with the facts that the poem almost neglects, and has to do with selection among these facts. The novel, supposing it to be historical, uses first the methods of the history, leavens the result with fancy, sets it forth suggestively, and, keeping in view the end of art instead of the necessity for truth, produces still other results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare, for instance, Carlyle's life of Cromwell, Milton's sonnet on Cromwell, and Scott's novel based upon the life of the same hero. It is such a distinction in the point of view which differentiates a novel from a Short Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the eighteenth century downward to near the present time, the great novelists have tried, from their little Olympus, to get the all-embracing view, to record the good and the bad, the thought and the action, the youthful deed and the aged penalty. Either by details, or, when that was not practicable, by suggestion, their transcription of life has been as full as they could make it. Their art is always to imitate the breadth and the fullness of living. At one extreme of this imitation is realism, and there the picture is somewhat photographic; at the other extreme is romance, where the reader's imagination is tickled into supplying much not plainly told by the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case, the life depicted in the books, like the life in the world, has many facets, and, even though the multiplicity of actual experience may not be present, the suggestion of it. if the book is good, will not be lacking. Thus this novel is natural, in so far as any artistic transfer of the real world into the world of imagination can be natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here we must make a further qualification and separation. All modern novels do not attempt to convey the suggestion of the whole of life, facet and facet, even though, to a greater extent than the Short Story, they ape the multiplicity of actual experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What of the so-called impressionistic school of which, in English at least, Henry James is the head? If you examine his &lt;em&gt;Washington Square&lt;/em&gt;, you will find it to be a love story of some length and of actual manners, a novel, indeed, according to definition, and yet every incident, every detail, every bit of description is focused upon the relation between the dull and faithful Catherine and her lover, the brilliant but unsteady Maurice Townsend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story covers the life of the girl to middle age, yet there is only one point of view, and, at the end, one impression. But this impression is not the result of the fusion of numerous observations, each drawn, as in real life, from some attitude, action, or remark upon character. This is the method of &lt;em&gt;Romola&lt;/em&gt; and of &lt;em&gt;The Egoist&lt;/em&gt;, but in &lt;em&gt;Washington Square&lt;/em&gt; it is attained by the presentation of certain incidents selected from the girl's life-story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use a geological figure, Henry James follows a single vein throughout its course by means of an occasional outcrop. Among foreigners, Turgenieff has done notable work, which must be regarded from this view-point. His Mumu is the story of the brute love of a gigantic serf Garassim for first a woman, and then a dog. The interest of the story centres entirely in this love and the character of which it is a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Diary of a Superfluous Man&lt;/em&gt; wonderfully presents a weak-willed, conceited lover, doing no work in the world and aware of it, but hungering for the tribute of praise and affection which only one worth it can gain. This is a life-story from birth to death, but this unfortunate's character, or lack of it, can be thoroughly illustrated in the course of his short love affair, and consequently the incidents selected are nearly all from that event itself, or preparatory to it, or in summary of what it has shown. Select certain passages regarding Levin from &lt;em&gt;Anna Karenina&lt;/em&gt;, and you could construct a companion piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 'impressionistic novels' and their class, to some extent an intermediate form between the novel of the &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt; type and the Short Story, may perhaps be looked upon as expanded Short Stories, and belonging to their genus. Without the concentration of that instrument and the resulting vividness, they are told with a like view, and a like selection of those facts which are at the base of all narration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the novel which attempts to give a natural picture of the various sides of life there is a point of view which differs from that of the Short Story. If the name had not already been appropriated, I should like to say the historical novel, because in this respect it follows the methods of history. The 'ubiquitous novel' it has been called, I believe, and this expresses the distinction which results in another structure and another treatment from that of the Short Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primal difference lies in the way the authors view their crude materials, which is to say the life about them. While the novel writer, even one of the impressionistic type, aims at an eminently natural method of transcription, the author of the Short Story adopts a very artificial one. His endeavor is to give a striking narrative picture of one phase of the situation or the character, as the case may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His aim is toward a strip lengthwise, disregarding much that a cross-section might show. He deals with a series of incidents, closely related to one another but not at all to the byplay of life which, in reality, must accompany them. He treats of a mood always existing, but in the story supremely indicated; perhaps of an adventure or a catastrophe, which differs from the denouement of a novel in that the interest is concentrated: the cause is in the hero's character, ready-made for the occasion; the results are in the circumstances of the tale. If all narration amounts, as critics say, merely to a simplification of experience, imaginative or real, then a Short Story is simplification to the highest degree. We are selecting far more than in a novel, and this because we are looking only for the chain of related incidents that go to make up one event. We are picking out the steps that make the tragedy, as in Maupassant's famous tale 'La Parure,' or in Bret Harte's 'The Outcasts of Poker Flat'; we are looking only for what bears upon our narrow purpose, that the interest may be concentrated, and the conception vivified, beyond the power of a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process is very artificial, but very powerful; it is like turning a telescope upon one nebula in the heavens. Thus it is the standpoint of the author that makes the distinction between a short novel, always excepting the impressionistic variety, and a long Short Story. In the one the writer digests life-histories, or portions of them; in the other he looks only for the episode, which, like the bubble on the stream, is part of, and yet distinguished from, the main current. Recognizing the futility in certain cases, and the needlessness in others, of expressing the whole truth, he succeeds much better with the half. He foregoes completeness and gains in force, and this by a change in the standpoint from which he views his world of fact and fancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence that the Short Story and the novel are not products of the same artistic process has been sought in the frequent inability of writers of good Short Stories to construct equally good novels, and if this argument is not pushed too far it is a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawthorne, perhaps, certainly Maupassant and Kipling, men who made their literary reputation by their Short Stories, found, and in the case of Kipling and his Kim, still find, difficulty with the longer form of the story. Bjornson had trouble in handling his novels, &lt;em&gt;Flags are Flying in Tozun and Harbor&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;In__God's Way&lt;/em&gt;, and much more testimony of the same character may be gathered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is much to be said against an absolute statement, for Tolstoi, Dickens, and many other great novelists have succeeded with the Short Story, and the excellence of Stevenson's unfinished &lt;em&gt;Weir of Hermislon&lt;/em&gt; is evident even in the fragment which he gave us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is safe to say no more than that the writer of Short Stories finds it generally difficult, and sometimes impossible, to enlarge his conceptions and broaden and lengthen his action to the scope which the novel demands, with this statement in reverse equally true for the novelists. But this is just what might be expected if, as I have endeavored to show, it is true that the difference between the modes lies in the point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For if the writer, who aside from his artistic faculty is after all merely a transcriber, gifted with the power of observation and granted the right of selection from what he sees, should look always for the essential facts that make up his single episode and produce his impression, he might see only Short Stories in the life about him, and find it as difficult to adjust his vision to a different perspective as the forester who looks only for single trees, their height and kind, and now would wish, with artist's eye, to comprehend the curves and colors in the wide sweep of the mountain forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up briefly what has been said heretofore, it might be asserted that what is loosely called the modern Short Story seems to differ from the old tale by a very scientific adaptation of means to end, which end may be called vividness, and by a structure which, in its nice proportions and potentiality for adequate expression, is a more excellent instrument than anything the old tale can show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, and this is true only of a more definite group which could be called the typical Short Story, through the source, which is an impression or impressions, and the purpose, which is to fitly convey these impressions as well as to tell a story. 'Ruth' will do very well as an example of the tale, 'The Purloined Letter' as a tale done into Short Story form, and 'The White Old Maid,' or 'A Lodging for the Night,' or 'Without Benefit of Clergy,' for the typical Short Story. If it is necessary to say what characterizes all of the shorter stories now being written, I should suggest that it is an attempt at greater vividness, and this attempt is made largely through those practices in composition which the endeavor to convey fitly an impression has brought into common use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a comparison with the novel, we may take all these shorter stories, and say that the difference lies in the point of view — provided that the novel be of that class which aims at a natural transcription of all sides of life, as does &lt;em&gt;Middlemarch&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it may be said that the Short Story differs from the 'impressionistic' novel in concentration only. That literary variety strikes deeper, goes further; but the Short Story is intended for surface work; it is formed to catch and record the striking things, and make them more striking. It is a precipitate of the important things from the general solution, and as such has a force distinctively its own and a form as distinctive, which, through the efforts of the great men who have labored with it, has been developed to gain and to exercise its power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle chapternumber no_toc&quot; id=&quot;chapter-iii&quot;&gt;Chapter III&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;new-developments-in-the-literature-of-the-short-story&quot;&gt;New Developments in the Literature of the Short Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New developments in literature do not arise nor become popular without reason. There are causes, artistic and otherwise, for the present blossoming of the Short Story, causes which in themselves differ from those which have made the novel flourish. In a time of much writing, tastes are quickly jaded, and the Short Story, because it is terse, striking, highly-colored, and somewhat new, meets with quick applause. Its brevity is of advantage, for many people can be made to swallow good literature in a pill who reject it in larger doses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the class of readers thus gained accounts less for the literary development of the tale than for the vast number of poor short stories now breeding manifold. Such a clientele can increase the production, and will usually debase the quality, of any form of literary endeavor, as the attitude of the prurient-minded populace of the Restoration increased and debased the output of the contemporary dramatists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unintelligent appreciation is not likely to be responsible for a high development in art. That there has been an artistic advance, and a great one, in story-telling, needs for illustration only a comparison of a Blackwood's &lt;em&gt;Tale of the 30's&lt;/em&gt; and a Kipling Indian story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old desire for something new and more pungent would account for the encouragement which this new development has received. And there is an undoubted need, in a generation whose life is greatly varied by widely-diffused knowledge and extensive intercommunication, for the vivid expression of little things. This would add another impulse. But a literary structure which displays the greatest nicety of form to be found outside the domain of poetry indicates some more aesthetic cause than those so far mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simple truth, the Short Story has attained a wonderful perfection because wonderful men have worked with and through it. It has just come into its own. In the of the 30's, publishers would not look upon anything less than a volume in fiction as a serious literary effort — and they preferred three volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was only in the first half of the last century that Irving, Hawthorne, and Poe in America began the cult of the tale. Coppée's search for the inevitable word, and Maupassant's refinement of the conté, came later still. The Short Story was adapted to the needs of the time and the tastes of the people. Men of genius found through it a new voice, and the attempt to perfect, to give laws and a form to the instrument, progressed because of the men who tried. In pre-Hawthornian times these authors employed the tale for the by-products of their minds; since then it has served to express some of the great conceptions of their genius. It is this which best accounts for the chastening of its form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except in one instance, which is the vivid expression of single incidents or detached movements in life, the Short Story is not to be chosen before the novel; but in its capacity for perfection of structure, for nice discrimination in means, and for a satisfying exposition of the full power of words, it is much superior to the novel, and can rank only below the poem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the novel and the Short Story are distinct instruments, differently designed, for diverse needs. And with such a point of view it is impossible not to grant to the latter a separate use and classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the place and this the time to discuss finally the technique of the narratives which nowadays we name by the phrase short story. After Bret Harte made his success, the type, if not exhaustively developed, was well established, and favorably recognized in America, in England, and in France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, such new potentialities of achievement as were possible by means of it had been already comprehended with a thoroughness which could only lead to abundant use, and the accomplishments of the later years of the nineteenth century, and the first of the new one, were not of that revolutionary character which justifies a minute and tedious investigation of form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are better reckoned by different methods of analysis, the more so since it is dangerous, when the artist is working with methods very well understood by himself and his readers, to waste upon processes which have become obvious that attention which should be given to his purpose and the result. So this, and no later, is the moment for a recapitulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the ammunition, in the discussion of the short story which has continued now for some twenty-five years, has been expended not so much upon the technical structure as upon the accomplishment of this new narrative form, and its nature as thereby determined. Among the numerous American critics—I say American, for, with a few exceptions, the attitude of the English critic has seldom been au serieux—Professor Charles Sears Baldwin has made, to be sure, important contributions to our knowledge of the structure of the short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But critical subtlety has so far been chiefly busied with the difference between short story and merely short story and with all which would serve to define what Poe and his successors had given us. Nor have unnecessary complications been wanting in a not very simple matter, for each succeeding writer has tried to make his definition a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;definitions&quot;&gt;Definitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reviewing definitions, let us adopt a pragmatic plagiarism. Professor Brander Matthews, harking back to Poe's often quoted distinctions, began the whole discussion with his essay on &lt;em&gt;The Philosophy of the Short-story&lt;/em&gt;, first printed, in its entirety, in 1885.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He defined the short story by its effect, a certain unity of impression which set it apart from other kinds of fiction, and he was the first, after Poe, to attempt an explanation of what out short-story writers had been accomplishing, the first to recognize that they had accomplished something new. Spurred on by an invaluable distinction, which made us see, as we had long felt, that fiction was upon a new trail, the present writer endeavored to press onward into the matter, urging that a conscious impressionism, a deliberate attempt to convey a single impression of a mood, or emotion, or situation, to the reader, was a distinguishing characteristic, and that this, and not a chain of incidents, was the consequent sum total of the short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that time, many able critics have entered the arena, and although the new short story has received no final definition, most of those interested in literary types and their qualities have recognized and commented upon its special features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the short story of all the centuries, the short story in general, as discussed in the earlier chapters of this book, is not sharply marked off from other forms. In the fourteenth century, it is sometimes hard to separate from the romance; in the seventeenth, it runs to the novel; in the eighteenth, it blends with the sketch of manners and of character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, in all the great literatures there were those groups of narratives whose subject-matter required that they should be short, narrative varieties which, to look at them externally, were recognized forms, ready for any writer who had short narratives to tell. Their changing rounds in the history of English literature may await recapitulation in a final chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the aforementioned critics have had under discussion chiefly that variety of short story just now most popular: the variety which has been given the type-name, short story, somewhat as we in the United States have been called American; and to its nature and purpose their definitions have especial reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this was excellent. Our short story is sharply marked off from other forms. To be sure, it reveals itself as merely a special case and particular development of the endless succession of distinctively short narratives which, since the world began, have dealt with those life-units that were simple, brief, and complete in their brevity. But it differs from them in degree, if not in kind. This special case can show an infinitely higher measure of unity in narrative, of totality in petto, than had ever been sought consciously before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a particular development which came because, in our nineteenth century, there were situations, emotions, thoughts, pressing for expression in narrative, which could not get themselves expressed so well in any simpler fashion. The high and gloomy imagination of &lt;em&gt;The House of Usher&lt;/em&gt;, the poignant terror of &lt;em&gt;The Masque of the Red Death&lt;/em&gt;, the snapping humor of &lt;em&gt;Margery Daw&lt;/em&gt;, the vivid humor-pathos of &lt;em&gt;The Luck of Roaring Camp&lt;/em&gt;, the infinitely subtle, infinitely moving passion of &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt;, could never have been otherwise given into words. As well have made caryatids of Mino da Fiesole's low reliefs, or frescoes of the Memling virgins on the shrine at Bruges, as express by any other method these various stories!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This higher unity was sought first by a mind full of sharp and terrible impressions needing brief and vivid narrative—that was Poe. It was continued by a century full of changing social orders, colonization with its contrasts, a civilization rapidly altering its superficies, a peculiar growth everywhere of introspection, analysis, love for the unobvious in manners and in life. Indeed, it was demanded by the characteristics of a period which supplied innumerable situations—significant nodes, as it were, where our attention clung—situations requiring swift, brief, and vivid narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus, while the new short story was only a modification of the old short story, at its best there was just the distinction that exists between the chronometer and the watch, the chemist's balance and the grocer's scales. It was a variety constructed for difficult and unusual services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-climax&quot;&gt;The Climax&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus a real necessity lay behind the change which gave us a short story that was ponderable and yet brief. The means by which this change came about I have already discussed at length in the chapter upon Poe. It was that shift of emphasis to the climax which inevitably followed upon a conscious impressionistic purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the climax and the climax alone was in the author's foremost thoughts, reproportioning, and a subordinating of all the elements of the story to its desired result followed automatically, and produced the highly characteristic opening, and most familiar end. The minutiae of the process it is in the province of the rhetoricians to describe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is the climax? Sometimes, the incident towards which all the episodes led, which collected, like a brass globe, all the electric charge of emotion, thought, or vivid impression to be drawn from the story. Sometimes, and much oftenest, the situation, which had been the root and first perception of the tale, and now, in this climax, was most sharply revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But among those short stories which differ most thoroughly from ordinary short narrative, or from the novel with its different view-point, a single impression, a vivid realization for the reader of that which moved the author to write, be it incident, be it emotion, be it situation, this is the conscious purpose of the story, and this is the climax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus the art of the short story becomes as much an art of tone as of incident. Sometimes one feels that the tone is more important, that in certain stories of Maupassant's, like &lt;em&gt;La Peur&lt;/em&gt;, in Stevenson's &lt;em&gt;Markheim&lt;/em&gt;, or Kipling's &lt;em&gt;Without Benefit of Clergy&lt;/em&gt;, any mere arrangement of incident is trivial when compared with the supreme skill by which all that kindles the fancy, arouses or tranquilizes the passions, has been controlled from the outset, and swayed until the work of the writer is harmonized into one tone, as if narrative were painting, and the artist a Rembrandt at work with fluent oils!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then one recalls that such excellence has come only because, in order to do so much with so short a space of narrative, a most exacting art is necessary, and that, after all, this perfection of tone is required and is originated by the desire to emphasize the climax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, like Phoebus Apollo, the new short story relies upon the arrow it looses straight for the heart or the head, and this arrow, this impression, carries the sum total of the energy of the narrative. Does &quot;an impression &quot; seem a vague and bookish phrase? If so, consider a modern instance, the situation of a cultivated sceptic and rationalist who feels himself falling victim to the splendid beauty of the Roman ritual and the austere assurance of the Roman creed. Try to make a story of that situation—it is reasonably typical of modern short-story material—and, fail or succeed, you will understand sympathetically the task of the modern short-story teller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;a-needful-qualification-of-the-short-story&quot;&gt;A Needful Qualification of the Short Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a needful qualification. This discussion of the typical short story of our century in no sense can be used to cover all current short narrative. Beside the consciously impressionistic tales are to be found survivals of earlier types, and innumerable stories which are scarcely typical enough for exact classification. But one can roughly group them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, then, we shall still be given new instances of those old, simple short narratives which have a totality of their own, and, at the best, a good unity of impression, yet are far, and rightly far, from any conscious attempt to convey one effect, and only one, for sum total. As long as there are suitable plots, there will be such tales. Thank Heaven, there are still some men who know how, and care, to write them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, comes a second class, this time more nearly related to our impressionistic short story. It is here that one finds all those good tales of lively plot, wonderful happenings, humorous turns, where to search for an impressionistic effect would be absurd; and yet in them is to be discerned that structural shift of emphasis which came in with the impressionistic short story. Here is to be placed the average magazine story, when it does not belong to the incompetents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their stories, and the number is already vast, boldly present a sufficient plot, but do not quite attain. Here are the short stories manques of our own period, stories which ought to have shot direct to the mark, but wavered and fell short in the flight. Here are the stories of situations whose full significance the writer dimly saw, and conveys more dimly still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, finally, the short story as it has been fully realized for our time; not absolutely better than the best of simple short narratives, but far better for its own purposes; a literary type which shares some of the exaltation of all the difficult arts, which is incomparably the most successful form of short narrative for us, perhaps the most successful variety of contemporary fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is true because its fashion of telling does so much with the short-story form, does so much with those especial life-units of which the present generation has been most ready to read and most eager to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;two-distinguishing-characteristics-of-all-true-short-stories&quot;&gt;Two Distinguishing Characteristics of All True Short Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than seventy years ago Edgar Allan Poe, in reviewing a volume of Hawthorne's tales, said some things about the short story that have been quoted by practically every man who has written upon the subject since. After discussing the technique of the novel, Poe declared:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ordinary novel is objectionable from its length, for reasons already stated in substance. As it cannot be read at one sitting, it deprives itself, of course, of the immense force derivable from totality. Worldly interests intervening during the pauses of perusal modify, annul, or contract, in a greater or less degree, the impressions of the book. But simply cessation in reading would of itself be sufficient to destroy the true unity. In the brief tale, however, the author is enabled to carry out the fullness of his intention, be it what it may. During the hour of perusal the soul of the reader is at the writer's control. There are no external or extrinsic influences—resulting from weariness or interruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this statement Poe has given us the two distinguishing characteristics of all true short stories which set them apart in a class by themselves as a distinct literary type— brevity and the necessary coherence which gives the effect of totality. The only limitation upon the development of the type which can be established beyond question is the physical inability or unwillingness of the average reader or listener to keep his mind on any one topic for any great length of time. The limits to human patience are not very different today from what they were before the flood. A man will listen just so long to a story or read just so many pages and then the spell is broken; his mind demands a change of diet, and the effect of the story is lost. Every extraneous statement, every unnecessary word, must be eliminated in order to bring the tale within the bounds of patience. And any tale which fails to meet these fundamental requirements of brevity and coherence is not a true short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This negative statement eliminates a large mass of published matter from the field of our consideration and relieves us from the necessity of attempting to find a justification for that apparently inexcusable thing, an intended short story which is not short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further than this, Poe's statement not only furnishes a negative basis for telling what a short story is not, but it also offers a positive foundation upon which we can establish a definition of the short story which declares that a short story is a brief tale which can be told or read at one sitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This definition requires two things of the story: (1) that it shall be short and (2) that it shall possess coherence sufficient to hold the reader's or listener's unflagging interest from beginning to end. The terms of the definition are of necessity relative. It is, of course, impossible to draw a hard and fast line and say that any story which contains less than so many hundred words is short, while a tale which contains one word more than the allotted portion is long. The personal equation entering into the problem also renders it impossible to establish any fixed measure of the degree of coherence which is required to hold a reader's or listener's unflagging attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more we look into the matter the more evident it becomes that the limits and distinguishing characteristics of the short story as we know it today are the limits and distinguishing characteristics of the spoken story as it has existed from the beginning of time. It is frequently possible to read at one sitting a story which is not brief, but it would be a physical impossibility to tell at one sitting any story of this sort so as to hold the unbroken interest of a group of listeners. Human impatience insists that a spoken story shall be brief and to the point; and no better line of demarcation than this can be found to set off the literary type with which we are concerned from its brethren, the novel and the novelette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we accept the test of brevity and coherence which this definition proposes, the only question which arises is as to its adequacy. Are brevity and coherence to be accepted as the sole distinguishing marks of a literary type? Or is it necessary to introduce some further limitations which will render our conception of the short story more concrete?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe, in his criticism already quoted, maintained that in order to produce a true short story an author must not only make his tale short and to the point, but must also fashion it with deliberate care so that it will produce a single effect; and this statement has been accepted with more or less unquestioning faith by practically every man who has written authoritatively upon the short story since Poe's time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-single-effect-of-the-short-story&quot;&gt;The Single Effect of the Short Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brander Matthews &lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.talesofmurder.com/murderwiki/the-philosophy-of-the-short-story/&quot;&gt;[&lt;i&gt;Philosophy of the Short Story&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt; declares that &quot;the short story is the single effect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Bliss Perry &lt;small&gt;[&lt;i&gt;A Study of Prose Fiction&lt;/i&gt;, p. 304]&lt;/small&gt;, while rejecting many of Mr. Matthews's conclusions, agrees with him that the short story of the nineteenth century is set off from those that preceded it by the &quot;new attitude of the contemporary short-story writer toward his material, in his conscious effort to achieve under certain conditions a certain effect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Canby &lt;small&gt;[&lt;i&gt;The Short Story in English&lt;/i&gt;, p. 233]&lt;/small&gt; says that &quot;Poe succeeded in his work by fixing the attention upon the climax of his story, so that the reader sees, feels, thinks of the ' unique effect ' of the story and of nothing else. If the modern short story has a technique, here it is; if it is an invention, Poe invented it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only natural that the way in which these men make a fetish of &quot;effect &quot;should lead us to inquire whether, after all, this striving to produce a single foreseen impression is the only manner in which the coherence essential to a true short story can be secured!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a casual consideration of the subject presents objections to the &quot;effect &quot;theory of the short story. If, as Professor Matthews declares, &quot;the short story is the single effect,&quot; then most certainly such tales as &lt;em&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;/em&gt; must be classed as short stories in violation of all of the canons of brevity; and if this cannot be done, the single effect definition will have to be modified. Dr. William J. Dawson &lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.talesofmurder.com/murderwiki/the-modern-short-story/&quot;&gt;[“The Modern Short Story” – &lt;i&gt;North American Review&lt;/i&gt; 190:802]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt; holds that the true short story treats &quot;of one incident and only one,&quot; and Professor Matthews says that: &quot;The short story fulfills the three false unities of the French classic drama: it shows one action, in one place, in one day.&quot; If these statements are accepted, ninety percent, of the tales that are commonly regarded as short stories will have to be put in some other class of literature. The question naturally arises, what are we going to do with Kipling's &lt;em&gt;The Man Who Would Be King&lt;/em&gt;, which deals with four distinct episodes in as many different places, or with a story like Bjornson's &lt;em&gt;The Father&lt;/em&gt;, which covers a whole lifetime? The answer which suggests itself is that instead of trying to make every sort of tale a separate literary type, it may be easier and more satisfactory to attempt to frame a comprehensive definition of the short story which by its nature will be inclusive instead of exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back for a moment to a consideration of the statement that the only way in which coherence in a short story can be secured is by striving to produce a single foreseen effect, it is altogether probable that even Professor Matthews would experience some difficulty in pointing out the single effect which Mr. Stockton aimed to produce with &lt;em&gt;The Griffin and the Minor Canon&lt;/em&gt;, or which &quot;Q &quot;had in mind when he wrote &lt;em&gt;John and the Ghosts&lt;/em&gt;. And the statement which applies to these tales of fancy would probably also hold true in a consideration of those tales whose sole purpose is to give a plain unvarnished statement of the facts in the case, without giving the slightest thought to any one particular effect which those facts may produce. In this class would come such narratives as the Biblical story of Joseph, Bjornson's stories of Norwegian peasant life, and most of Kipling's soldier stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best of these stories of fancy and fact are just as coherent as any tale ever told by Poe or de Maupassant with the idea of producing a single effect; and every one of them has just as much right to the name &quot;short story &quot;as is possessed by any other tale. The short story frequently deals with more than one incident, and does not by any means always produce a single foreseen effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These facts would seem to lead to the conclusion that any attempt to limit the definition of a short story beyond the statement that it is &quot;a brief tale which can be told or read at one sitting,&quot; is for our purposes inadvisable, if not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acceptance of this definition as it stands renders unnecessary any such efforts at classification as Mr. Matthews's rather futile attempt to distinguish between the &quot;Short-story &quot;(spelled with a hyphen and a capital S), &quot;the story which is merely short,&quot; &quot;the brief tale,&quot; and &quot;the sketch&quot; and leaves us free to include all short stories under one heading for study as a literary type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who insist upon some further subdivision of the great inclusive short story group, it will then be possible to classify short stories in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, as to substance,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A—Stories of Fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B—Stories of Fancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, as to form,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A—Stories told historically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B—Stories told dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C—Stories told didactically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the telling of a tale, what is not fact is fancy. Of course, the two classifications frequently overlap. Elements of fancy are found in fact narratives, while fanciful tales are constructed upon foundations of fact. It is possible, however, to throw all short stories into one group or the other in accordance with the element which makes up the substance of the story. Fact stories appear every day in the newspapers and in the narratives which make up the record of the historian. Stories of fancy have existed from the earliest time as one expression of man's desire to take himself occasionally far from the world of hard and inescapable facts. This classification brings us back to the basic truth in the child's division of his world into one part &quot;really truly &quot;and one part &quot;let's pretend.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;how-stories-are-told--historically-dramatically-or-didactically&quot;&gt;How Stories Are Told – Historically, Dramatically, or Didactically&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After short stories have been grouped as stories of fact or stories of fancy, another classification suggests itself based upon the way in which the stories are told. A story of fact or a story of fancy may be told in any one of three ways—historically, dramatically or didactically. The same story may be told in three different ways. The man using the historical narrative method seeks primarily to convey the impression that here is the matter-of-fact story of things just as they happened. The man using the dramatic method seeks a single effect; while the didactic method involves as the chief consideration, the effort to teach a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the light of this classification it would appear that those who undertake to define the short story as &quot;the single effect &quot;are clearly striving to make a part greater than the whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these men whose opinions on the short story we have been considering regard the short story as distinctly a nineteenth-century type of literature, as a literary form which was first successfully employed by Poe and his French contemporaries. As a matter of fact, even the briefest consideration of the history of literature should be sufficient to convince us that the short story, far from being a distinctive product of the nineteenth century, is the oldest form of literature, from which all other literary types, with the exception of the lyric and the critical essay, have developed in the course of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oral tradition begins with the first human family; and it is to this first oral tradition that we look for the genesis of the short story. Anthropologists assure us that primitive man was endowed with substantially the same imagination, pride in achievement, curiosity, and love of excitement and novelty which characterize the average man today. These are the attributes upon which the story-telling faculty depends; and hence we reach the conclusion that ever since human nature has been constituted as it is now men have been telling stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Bliss Perry says &lt;small&gt;[&lt;i&gt;A Study of Prose Fiction&lt;/i&gt;, p. 302]&lt;/small&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Story-telling is as old as the day when men first gathered around a camp-fire or women huddled in a cave. The study of comparative folk-lore is teaching us every day how universal is the instinct for it. Even were we to leave out of view the literature of oral tradition, and take the earlier written literature of any European people—for instance, the tales told by Chaucer and some of his Italian models—we should find these modem characteristics of originality, ingenuity, and the rest in almost unrivaled perfection, and perhaps come to the conclusion of Chaucer himself, as he exclaims in whimsical despair, &quot;There is no new thing that is not old.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far back as research carries us in the history of any people, we find a well-defined oral literature. Scholars of every nationality &lt;small&gt;[Notably Grimm and Panl in Germany, Child in England, and Gautier and those who have supported and opposed his theories in France]&lt;/small&gt; in studying the epic and the ballad have traced for us the steps that mark the growth of the early national literatures. We find the great epics, the &lt;em&gt;Chanson de Roland&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Nibelungenlied&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Beowulf&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt;, developing from ballad cycles, centering about national heroes, which are shown to have rested upon lesser ballad groups dealing with separate achievements of these heroes, which, in their turn, can be, at least theoretically, split up into their component parts—single isolated ballads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the processes of association, selection, and elimination by which the innumerable ballad groups and cycles which merged to form the epics were brought together, we are not concerned; but it will further the object of our inquiry to bear in mind the fact that the early ballads, which were merely short stories in rhythmical form, rested ultimately upon a basis of prose narrative—oral short stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M. Leon Gautier, in the introduction to his monumental work on the French epics &lt;small&gt;[&lt;i&gt;Les Epopées Françaises&lt;/i&gt;, T. I., p. 3]&lt;/small&gt;, accounts for the initial appearance of the lyric by declaring that the first emotions of the first man in the garden of Eden must have been such as could be expressed only in song; and in making this statement he is merely following a similar assertion found in Victor Hugo's preface to &lt;em&gt;Cromwell&lt;/em&gt;. However, neither Gautier nor Hugo goes so far as to maintain that the progenitors of the human race continued to talk in lyrics after the novelty of their situation wore off; and it is an historical fact that the only conversations in Eden which have been recorded were carried on in prose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our earliest histories we find that the art of telling stories had reached a point where the existence of fully developed cycles of spoken stories is taken as a matter of course. Tacitus refers to &quot;the peculiar kind of verses current among the Germans, the recital of which they call barding.&quot; Einhard, in his life of Charlemagne, tells how the great emperor &quot;had the old rude songs that celebrate the deeds and wars of the ancient kings written out for transmission to posterity.&quot; And in the old Anglo-Saxon poem of &lt;em&gt;Widsith&lt;/em&gt; we find references to cycles of stories centering about Attila the Hun, Chlodovech the Frank, Theodoric the Ostrogoth, Rothari the Lombard, and Gunther the Burgundian. These cycles of stories spread all over western Europe, and the written literature of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries developed out of this spoken literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This glimpse into the development of national literatures would seem to warrant the statement that while the epic is a national contribution to literature, and the ballad is a communal product, the short story, which in the last analysis proves to be the base of all our literature, excepting only the lyric and the critical essay, is distinctly an individual contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theory of the development of an oral literature which makes the short story a primary unit does not rest entirely upon conjecture. Oral literature is to be found today wherever there is a more or less primitive state of race culture. In Hawaii, where even an alphabet was unknown until the arrival of the missionaries in 1820, a well-defined oral literature, rich in truly epic material, still survives, and it is possible to observe in that Territory at first hand the actual process of literary development suggested and outlined above. The same statement holds true in a degree of the Voodoo tales current among the Southern negroes, fragments of a great body of spoken stories brought from the African jungles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is much easier to produce evidence to support a theory of the antiquity of the short story as a type than it is to unearth the connecting links to make complete the chain of evidence to prove that the short story as it is known today is not only the oldest of all literary types, but had also had a continuous existence from the very beginning of time to the present day in essentially the same form as we know it now. The difficulty of this latter task is due to the fact that until comparatively recent times the short story has been to a very large extent an oral genre, preserved as spoken and not written literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this are not hard to find. The output of ancient scribes and mediaeval printers was too limited to warrant the wasting of much of their time in the preservation of short stories, which everyone told and everyone knew. Such stories and ballads as were written, or at a later date printed, were as a rule valued so lightly by the scholars of the day that no serious effort was ever made to preserve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the literatures of Western Europe, with which we are most familiar, the wide gap existing between written and spoken languages, taken together with the fact that only a very small portion of the population was at all familiar with the written language, tended, for centuries, to set the folk literature far apart from the literature of the scholars. The tales told in prose and verse by the people using the vulgar tongue were never considered as literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the dialects of the common people became national languages the number of stories written down was greatly increased; but still it was only very rarely that any effort was made to preserve collections of tales. The attitude toward folk literature that had been built up through so many centuries could not readily be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this connection it is of more than ordinary interest to note the extent to which this popular conception of the short story as anything but literature moved Boccaccio, who thought so lightly of the Decameron that, although it was first given to the public in Florence in 1353, he did not submit it to Petrarch, his dearest literary friend, until after a lapse of nineteen years, in 1372 &lt;small&gt;[cf. Boccaccio’s &lt;i&gt;Decameron&lt;/i&gt; (Bohn). Notes by W. K. Kelly, pp. 541 ff.]&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically no one could read, so that collections of stories, even in the popular tongue, were of little use. It was only occasionally, and then more often by a series of happy accidents than because of any recognition of merit, that the work of the masters of the short story was preserved. Nevertheless tales were told in those days just as they had been from the beginning and will be to the end; and we know that Boccaccio, Chaucer, and Rabelais, far from standing alone as exponents of their genre, were merely the master craftsmen in a host of story tellers. Even with our very imperfect knowledge of the periods when they lived and wrote, we are able to discover the works of long lists of forgotten lesser lights who preceded and came after them in the field of storytelling. Modern students of the &lt;em&gt;Decameron&lt;/em&gt; have succeeded in compiling a list of no less than twenty-eight collections of stories, the work of hundreds of authors—Greek, Latin, Oriental, Provencal, French, and Italian—from which much of the material for the immortal hundred tales was derived, while the list of immediate followers and imitators of Boccaccio is even more formidable than the array of his predecessors. These few early works which are still known to present-day scholars are, of course, but fragments of the great body of oral short stories which existed during the twenty centuries or more that they represent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tremendous growth in the numbers of the reading public and the corresponding development of periodicals during the past two centuries, and particularly in the last one hundred years, has brought about the transformation of the short story from a spoken to a written type of literature. The great public, which was formerly satisfied to have its stories told to it, has become literate, and now reads for itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the attitude of the scholars of the Middle Ages, who regarded the short story as an undignified excrescence upon the body of literature, unworthy of recognition or preservation, still persists in some quarters today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having considered past and present conditions as they bear upon the general theory of the antiquity and continuous existence of the short story, it behooves us to examine the specific evidence which justifies the statement that the short story of the nineteenth century is in no essential way different from the tales which preceded it by a thousand years or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The declaration is frequently made that Poe created a new literary type when he laid down his rules for the short story. But Poe's rules applied only to one class of short stories, those told to produce a single effect. Professor Matthews, Professor Perry, and their followers, in accepting Poe's dictum, have treated one class of short stories as if they constituted the whole body of short-story literature ; and, therefore, it is only necessary for us, in considering their declaration that the short story as we know it today is essentially a nineteenth-century product, to look up the antecedents of the tale that is told to produce a single effect. Is it possible that this one class of stories has developed so recently as to warrant the statement that it belongs exclusively to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the search back to the beginnings of things, through the cycles of medieval tales to the ballads which have been preserved as the oldest fragments of the great body of prehistoric oral literature, reveals not merely one method of telling stories or two, but every type of the short story, we have reason to believe that every type of the short story was to be found even in the earliest tales of all, the prose narratives from which the ballads developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no question as to the antiquity of historical and didactic methods of storytelling, and the examples of &quot;effect &quot;stories in the most primitive literatures are numerous enough to warrant the conclusion that such tales have almost, if not quite, as ancient a lineage as the other forms of the short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not a literature known to modern research which does not contain ghost stories told to produce a single effect. The intensely dramatic story upon which Burger founded his ballad of &lt;em&gt;Lenore&lt;/em&gt; is found in the very earliest popular poetry of England, in different parts of Germany, in the Slavic countries, and in one form or another all over Western Europe. For compression, speed, and the skill with which a single effect is produced, this grim, primeval tale as it is told in the old ballads bears the same stamp of superlative excellence which is placed on the best product of Poe's pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old Germanic ballad of &lt;em&gt;Tannh ä user&lt;/em&gt;, published in the Amim and Brentano collection of &lt;em&gt;Volkslieder&lt;/em&gt;, is another example of the antiquity of the &quot;effect &quot;story. The &lt;em&gt;coup de théâtre&lt;/em&gt; at the end of the story is just the sort of thing that we find in the work of the masters of the short story in the nineteenth century. Still another example of this same thing is to be found in the old English ballad of &lt;em&gt;Lord Randall&lt;/em&gt;: and many pages would be required to give a complete list of the &quot;effect &quot;stories which might be selected from collections of English and German ballads alone, without any consideration of other literatures presenting the same features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Boccaccio and his imitators and in the numerous collections of tales brought into Europe from the Orient we find all of the essential variations of the story told to produce a single effect, along with tales told in accordance with the other methods of narration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the scope of the investigation becomes wider, it becomes more and more evident that as far back as it is possible to trace literary forms every type of the short story is to be found. The &quot;effect &quot;story has always persisted as a recognized mode of literary expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the development of periodicals and newspapers created a demand for the printed short story, this form made its appearance along with the others. Poe, Pushkin, and Merimee were all producing it at the same time; and the wide dissemination of Poe's dictum and of the rules of the successful French realists, through the newly established periodicals and other products of the constantly improving printing-press, led to the wave of over-emphasis of the &quot;effect &quot;story which is still with ns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facts and theories which have been cited above would seem to offer a pretty solid basis for the conclusion that the short story as it is known in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is not a new form of literature, but is rather the elementary literary type, whose essential characteristics have remained unchanged throughout all the ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the essentials of the short story are today what they were in the beginning, and if there is really nothing new or distinctive in striving to attain a given effect, the question arises, what is to be done with Professor Matthews's theory of the evolution of the short story, with Professor Perry's statement that the attitude of the modem story-teller toward his material is different from that of his forerunners, and with the numerous other authoritative utterances which treat the short story as a new literary type brought into being by Poe and his contemporaries early in the nineteenth century? What explanation is to be offered for the difference which exists between the stories which de Maupassant and Boccaccio told with the idea of producing a single effect, or between a story of horror as it is set forth in one of Poe's narratives and as it is told in an old ballad?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to account for and explain this difference we must first determine what it is, wherein it is to be found. If the best stories of today are put side by side with those of four hundred or four thousand years ago, the old stories and the new ones not only fall together into the classes enumerated above, but also prove to be alike in methods of treating plot, setting, and characters, and are on a plane of absolute equality so far as unity of action, originality, and ingenuity are concerned. The fundamental characteristics of the best short stories today are the features that have characterized the best stories of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only difference between modern short-story technique and that of the Middle Ages is a verbal one. The only development that can be traced is not an improvement in any distinctive essential of the art of story-telling, but is merely a general development in the knowledge of words and the ability to use them, which affects the framing of wills and the formulation of official documents much more vitally than it does the telling of tales. The average short-story writer today can be a better craftsman than the man who told tales a thousand years ago, solely because he has better tools of expression at his command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extensive vocabularies are a product of the printing-press. The early short stories were told by men with comparatively few words at their command; and if the study of modern tales reveals in some instances a greater compression and a more realistic atmosphere than is to be found in the old stories, these things may be ascribed to the superior verbal equipment of the modern writer, which enables him to use exactly the right word in the right place, where his predecessor, piling up phrase upon phrase, could only approximate his meaning. Such development of the short story as there has been is due very largely to the development of the dictionary; and there would seem to be reason for holding that this narrow ground is the only one upon which any kind of an evolutionary study of the short story can be based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final test of a theory of the sort set forth in the preceding pages, after all historical requirements have been met, is its application to present conditions. During the generation that has elapsed since 1870 five men have stood out above all others as masters of every form of the short story. These five men—Alphonse Daudet, Rudyard Kipling, Robert Louis Stevenson, Frank R. Stockton, and Sir Arthur Quiller-Coueh—have not attempted to restrict their genius to any one channel, but have written fact stories and tales of fancy, telling these stories historically, dramatically, or didactically with impartial and unfailing skill. These men have, of course, their distinctive traits, their individual strong points and weaknesses; but they are alike in their conception of the fundamental characteristics of the short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instinct for story-telling exists in substantially the same form in every race; all men recognize and insist upon the simple limitations of brevity and coherence; and hence, in this field of literature more than in any other, it is possible for an artist to produce masterpieces whose appeal, in spite of national lines and racial characteristics, is truly universal. The best short stories are not essentially French, English, Italian, or American, but are a part of the world's anthology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- table-of-contents --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literary masterpieces of the first order in the short story have, so far, been rare. Poe not only added to their number, he made, as it were, two masterpieces to spring after him where one might have grown before. Yet the work of this surprising American rises directly from the welter of sentimental, horrific narrative of the periodicals of his day; it is, in general, of like purpose, and of like substance, and was easily classified by his contemporaries as another variety of the &quot;grim tale.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all Poe's tremendous versatility, his obscure phases of a complex genius, and his manifold debts to universal literature, it is not to be forgotten that, at the beginning of his career, in 1833, he belonged distinctly to the school of romantic emotionalism where the Landons and the Shelleys had been experimenting. Nevertheless, though born of this school, he had already overtopped its most strenuous efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very pathetic, or very horrible story was, as the last chapter recorded, the ware most readily sold in English periodical-markets of the twenties and thirties. If, at the upper end of its register, one found the powerful &lt;em&gt;Ancient Mariner&lt;/em&gt;, or the intensely sensuous tales of Keats, at the other were those prose narratives whose appeal was only to the mawkish sensibilities of a sentimental generation. By them, the mind was left unfluttered, untouched, be the subject as horrid or as pathetic as you please. There is much in the work of Poe for which they supply no adequate source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a little earlier period, Germany, too, was experimenting with sensibility, especially with sensibility to the mysterious or awful. In the first decades of the century, the art of arousing such feelings in Teutonic hearts was largely appropriated by the so-called romantic school of German novelists and poets, that literary group about which Heine wrote so brilliantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting characteristic of their fiction was a thought or idea worked into the fabric of a strange or terrible story so that a thrill should run through the mind as well as the body of the reader. This characteristic is to be found in literature earlier than the so-called romantic school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It belongs to the most romantic parts of &lt;em&gt;Faust&lt;/em&gt;, and to &lt;em&gt;The Sorrows of Werther&lt;/em&gt;; its genesis may be in the transcendental philosophy of Schelling and Fichte. But let us keep to the poets and story-tellers, who embodied dreams, introspections, guesses at the nature of the soul, in the ghosts, elves, double personalities, soulless spirits, wild adventure, and sudden death which that romantic time had ready at hand for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is Tieck, who wrote, in &lt;em&gt;The__Runenberg&lt;/em&gt; (1802), of the beautiful spirit calling the hero's other self away from duty to the mountains; Hoffmann and his hideous sandman, who is perhaps an evil genius, perhaps the soul's own weakness viewed objectively; Fouque and the lovely Undine, who learns, in the sadness of her romance, what it means to have a soul. Such stories traffic in pathos, in mystery, or in horror, and work upon the sensibilities of their readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, with all their formlessness and their overwrought fantasy, they are superior to their English kin of the annuals in more than virility and art. They have an idea, a thought, a conception at the core, and therefore grapple with the mind and stir the emotions of the soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, every reason for supposing that the instant any English writer possessed of an intensity of thought equal to his depth of feeling should take up the weakly emotional story, some heightening of its effects would result, and the intellect of the reader would no longer remain unimpressed. Even though the highly-wrought, half-symbolic narratives which John Sterling contributed to &lt;em&gt;The Atheruseum&lt;/em&gt; in the late twenties show some traces of Germanism, they are evidence that such a development was bound to come without external influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the quickening agency of this German school in the genius of Poe is not now to be doubted. Several monographs have been published to show his knowledge of the German language and of the German romantic writers. Parallels between his stories and those of Hoffmann's have been pointed out which are close enough to prove a knowledge, a sympathy, and a lionlike borrowing. Still more convincing are his own half- veiled assertions. To be sure, the terror in his stories, so he said in his preface to the &lt;em&gt;Tales of the Grotesque and the Arabesque&lt;/em&gt;, was &quot;not of Germany, but of the soul.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terror of these German predecessors, however, is precisely a terror of the soul, for the first time systematically wrought into fiction. In the hands of Poe, it gained enormously in art, and awakened the emotions by means peculiar to his own genius. Yet one can readily believe that his Roderick in &lt;em&gt;The House of Usher&lt;/em&gt;, who pored over books which had the &quot;character of phantasm,&quot; Morelia, who was interested in the transcendentalism of Schelling and Fichte, Ægaeus, whom &quot;the realities of the world affected — as visions,&quot; are all identical with the young Poe when he freed his mind and later his fancy in the fields where Novalis sought the blue flower and all the German romanticists wandered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He seems, indeed, to have read as a young man much that the Germans had been reading, cultivated an introspective and intensely mystical view of his own personality in a fashion very characteristic of them, and, furthermore, familiarized himself with the stories of Hoffmann and of Tieck, wherein mysticism, complexities of the mind, terror of the soul, had been made to pay dividends through the agency of moderately good narrative. To say that Poe was a creature of German influence would be absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that German thought and fancy were sympathetic to his genius, would be putting it too mildly. Between these extremes the truth must lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Poe's &quot;thin and pallid lips&quot; would have curled if one had called him a transcendentalist — one of &quot;our friends of &lt;em&gt;The Dialas&lt;/em&gt; he sneeringly designated Emerson and the Concordians! Transcendentalism denotes, nevertheless, the quality in which Poe and these German story-tellers were alike. When brought to bear upon a goose-flesh tale of terror, that preoccupation with the things of the mind, which accompanied, or flowed from, transcendentalism, was bound to give the story substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night-walking ghost of the grim tale would be transformed into &quot;the blot upon the brain that will show itself without.&quot; The objective story would be changed to a subjective one. The terror, if it struck at all, would be made to strike through to the soul. Such a metamorphosis, as far as their imperfect technique would permit, was the accomplishment of the German romanticists. Such a metamorphosis, to a far higher degree, was wrought by Poe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-philosophical-element-of-poes-story-telling&quot;&gt;The Philosophical Element of Poe's Story-telling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of this philosophical element in Poe's story-telling is not to be measured by the opportunity which it presents for discussions in comparative literature. Its real importance lies in the effect upon the short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, most short stories had lacked specific gravity. Their weight in proportion to their size was less than that of the novel or the romance. These new tales gained weight by the idea which inspired them. The public, eager for grim stories, and getting fiction which reached no deeper than the hair, received at last full value for its money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germans began the transformation; only began it, for if there is weight there is also verbosity in German stories, and, pace Mr. Brownell, very little art to make up for it. Poe, following parallel lines, gave the short story of the romantic variety worth as well as weight. The conception of gloomy terror which impregnates &lt;em&gt;The House of Usher&lt;/em&gt; is as complete as the idea of medieval chivalry underlying &lt;em&gt;Ivanhoe&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Amontillado&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ligeia&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;The Masque of the Red Death&lt;/em&gt;, are as ounces of lead. Short as they are, they have more, not less, than the specific gravity required for durable literature, and, furthermore, they are excellent artistically. This transformation, when successful, was the first step in the nineteenth century's remodeling of the short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we leave the question of the soil whence sprang the genius of Poe, that curiously perfect plant — nightshade if you will — it is worth our while to speculate on the effect of his own nationality as it combined with the English and German fashion which he was following. Except Irving, he is the first American whom we have discussed, and Irving's subjects alone betray his nativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More is to be said of the national characteristics of Poe, partly as to taste, style, and like matters to be discussed later, partly as regards less obvious effects of environment upon his genius. He was an American with an English education. This made him somewhat cosmopolitan, and therefore more susceptible to currents of thought from abroad than would otherwise have been the case. He was young, and an American, at a time when an idealistic movement was in strong progress in his country. This encouraged the mystical tendencies of his mind. He was a fellow countryman of Irving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through all of Poe's younger life, Irving was the reverenced master of American literature, the first American to gain recognition abroad. His greatest success had been won in the short story, to which he kept because there he felt himself most original and most at home &lt;cite&gt;(P. M. Irving's Life of Irving, ii., 226-7)&lt;/cite&gt;. That this success was due as much to the perfection of telling as to the story substance itself, so keen a critic as Poe could not fail to discern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus a powerful stimulus, the example of a success, perceptibly attainable for him also, must have urged on the younger author to write stories of a high degree of artistic excellence. Irving was the admiration of both races. Yet how infinitely more imperative must have been the call to go and do likewise for an American, one of a vainglorious nation, who had scored, so far, but a single literary triumph which England was ready to admit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe must divide with the Germans, though his share was greater, the credit of giving specific gravity to the short story. But his tales of the grotesque and arabesque, with the exception of the &lt;em&gt;Canterbury&lt;/em&gt; stories, the best known and most influential in English, were made possible by a tour de force which was all his own. Leaving behind questions of origin, influence, and source, I follow Sainte-Beuve, and begin the endeavor to come at the more intimate and personal secrets of the art and power of Poe by a study of his first great success. &lt;em&gt;The MS. Found in a Bottle&lt;/em&gt; won Poe $100 in &lt;em&gt;The Saturday Visitor Competition&lt;/em&gt; of 1833, and his first popular reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;MS.&lt;/em&gt; records, in vividly realistic narrative, the experiences of a wanderer cast from the wreck of his own boat upon a vast spectral ship, manned by an ancient crew, and coursing tumultuously dead south over a frightful sea, until, as the story ends, an engulfing whirlpool in a vast amphitheater gapes for them, and amid the &quot;thundering of ocean and tempest, the ship is quivering — Oh God! and — going down!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there are dozens of contemporary stories where terrible adventures figure, but this first Poe tale contains a new thrill. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is partly because this young writer (he was probably only twenty-two when he composed the story) had relearned the old, easy, yet so universally neglected art of Defoe, the use of the specific word. Everyone does it now, and usually with such gross plethora of highly-colored verbs and adjectives that, even though Poe wrote with so strong an appeal to the senses that the wildest tale reads as if it had happened, our jaded taste may prejudice his achievement. Here are a few sentences from the story under discussion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Her huge hull was of a deep dingy black, unrelieved by any of the customary carvings of a ship. A single row of brass cannon protruded from her open ports, and dashed from the polished surfaces the fires of innumerable battle lanterns which swung to and fro about her rigging. — For a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy pinnacle as if in contemplation of her own sublimity, then trembled, and tottered, and — came down.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this vivid style is not, as so often with that contemporary master of specific prose, De Quincey, an end in itself, it is only a means to an end. It is one of several means to the end that a tremendous impression of the terrible at sea should be forced upon the most callous reader. The introductory paragraph, where one learns how scientific and how unfanciful is this traveler who is to tell such a strange story, is another means, this time to make the tale read true, and hence convey a stronger impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The character of the hero, a man who courts desperation with the coolness of the desperate, is yet another device to make the narrative real and impressive, for his character is in keeping with the tale of a hurricane sweeping the ship into the eternal night of the Antarctics. Thus this whole story is in every way bound up with a governing artistic purpose which never relaxes until the last word is written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deeper than the vivid, gloriously rhythmic style, deeper than the study of the hero's morbid personality, deeper than the adventures which thrill the nerve of the macabre, is the power which controls them all, the power and purpose to play the literary game with an artistic plan, every stroke controlled and effective, the end ever served by the means, and that end one deep impression upon the mind of his reader. This purpose and power is the most interesting deduction from Poe's first masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;poes-narrative-construction&quot;&gt;Poe's Narrative Construction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;The MS. Found in a Bottle&lt;/em&gt; is not completely typical even of Poe's earliest narrative work. We must add to our critical analysis a study of what seems to have been his earliest experiment in the introspective story, &lt;em&gt;Berenice&lt;/em&gt;, a tale composed probably in 1833, and published in 1835. &lt;em&gt;Berenice&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most distinctly unpleasant stories in literature. Terror of the soul in this case becomes torture of the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is a remarkable piece of narrative construction and very probably the first thoroughgoing illustration of the technique of the modern short story. Ægaeus, the hero of &lt;em&gt;Berenice&lt;/em&gt;, is a spiritual relative of the heroes of &lt;em&gt;Ligeia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Morelia&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Eleanora&lt;/em&gt;. In this instance, the romantic environment of boyhood, reading of the mystics, and a solitary life, have given Ægaeus a specialized disorder. He is troubled with superattentiveness, and ponders for hours upon some phrase, object, or word, which becomes, as it were, an idea, and his mental life. The beautiful Berenice, when she was a healthy being, never aroused his attention. Then a strange disease, withering her beauty, caused abnormalities in feature and form, until, for the distempered mind of the hero, she began to have some appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to his strange attentiveness to detail, her abnormal features caught upon his mind. He decided to marry her. Afterwards, his diseased brain continued to warp, until, in a terrible moment, every faculty was absorbed in an attentive contemplation of the teeth of Berenice, &quot;long, narrow, and excessively white, with the pale lips writhing about them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One sees faintly from this digest, most impressively from the story itself, that the horrible conclusion when the white teeth, torn in an insanity from the buried but still living Berenice, drop and are scattered to and fro about the floor, is absolutely logical; furthermore, that every turn of the plot leads to it, and every rhythmic description lends aid to establish the necessary tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this story Poe is again a master of an artistic purpose, as in &lt;em&gt;The MS. Found in a Bottle&lt;/em&gt;, and more cunning, more sparing of materials. But this is by no means all. The MS. is descriptive narrative only. &lt;em&gt;Berenice&lt;/em&gt; is a well-plotted story which totally embraces the significant actions in the lives of two characters, and does so with an economy of means hitherto unknown, and a force and vividness not hitherto surpassed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you compare its artificial (but how effective!) development with earlier tales, the secret of the technique of the modern short story comes with a rush. Our short story is a result of an artistic purpose; of an artistic purpose worked out, as in this instance, by means of an emphasis of the climax of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose that a man should be so obsessed by the sight of certain teeth that he would go for them to the grave. This is the story nucleus of &lt;em&gt;Berenice&lt;/em&gt;. Take the last clause — &quot;go for them to the grave.&quot; Put all the stress on it in your thinking. Develop your hero so that it would be probable that he would go for them to the grave. Modulate your style until the tone is such that your reader is in the mood where there is no humor in teeth stolen from the grave. Shift, in this fashion, all emphasis to the climax of the story, and, instantly, the whole art of the modern short story is demanded of you; for due structural change and rhetorical improvement must follow if you are to make vivid, memorable, and significant the climax in which your narrative culminates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe gave specific gravity to the short story, but his just described invention was far more important. By means of this shift of emphasis it has become easy to secure the effective unity of impression so desirable in a short story. This concentration upon the climax was the great first cause of all those niceties of construction which Professors Matthews and Baldwin have excellently expounded in their studies of modern short narrative. And it was by this simple device that Poe learned to pack into a few pages such effective significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Berenice&lt;/em&gt; is artificial. In structure, every story of Poe's, and many of those that followed, are highly sophisticated. Let us therefore be somewhat artificial in criticism; suppose that we have the beginning and the end of the problem, and seek for its middle. The solution of the beginning is that Poe, in common with the popular short-story writers of his times, sought to achieve mystery, pathos, horror by his stories (let the tales of ratiocination stand aside for an instant), but wishing to strike deeper than the sensibilities with which Miss Roberts and L. E. L. toyed, reach toward the intellect and the soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the end of the problem — he succeeded in his attempt by fixing the attention upon the climax of his story, usually some outward sign of an inward horror, such as Berenice's teeth, the physical terrors of the Antarctic, or &lt;em&gt;The Fall of the House of Usher&lt;/em&gt;, and always with this result, that the reader sees, feels, thinks of the &quot;unique effect&quot; of the story, and of nothing else. If the modern short story has a technique, here it is; if it is an invention, Poe invented it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question that remains is the unsolved middle of the problem. How did it come to be Poe who devised this new method of telling a story, a method used by nine-tenths of the notable short-story writers since?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-development-of-poes-structure&quot;&gt;The Development of Poe's Structure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason, in general, is that the urge of the time upon the first genius who should devote himself to this narrative of the emotions was necessarily towards a development of structure. Apparitions, double personalities, all the new plots which the romantic movement had provided and the story-tellers experimented with, were current and had failed of any great literary success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Germans came nearest to success from the very strength and variety of their fantasy. They added specific gravity to the short narrative, but only tales like Tieck's &lt;em&gt;The Goblet&lt;/em&gt;, which fell naturally into good short-story form, can be called well told. They failed ultimately for lack of structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irving, to be sure, had reached the pinnacle by dissolving his smaller share of fancy in the perfect liquid of a classic style, but he stood away from the movement, even threw back to earlier forms. Poe, on the contrary, was a romanticist to the core, and one who looked through realities into the dream world beyond. He was likewise a genius, and so the man of men to give strength and intensity to the weak story of the emotions and sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that he succeeded, and provided the needed road of easy expression for all this lurid story-making, was due to a more particular cause. Poe was poet and critic before he was story-teller. As poet, he came strongly under the influence of that sensuous verse of which Coleridge was prophet, Keats and the young Tennyson prime disciples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one draws up the rhetoric of this poetry, it appears that the carefully calculated effects of &lt;em&gt;The Ancient Mariner&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Eve of St. Agnes&lt;/em&gt; — effects of mystery, horror, beauty, the most sensuous of the emotions — are to be conveyed, primarily, by the connotative power of words, secondarily, by such arrangement of those incidents, moods, descriptions which make up the poem, as may best secure the desired effect. Impressionism, in its best sense, is the name which fits the technical process employed. Poe's verse, at any time after the end of his subserviency to Byron and to Moore, is in evident sympathy with this art. His critical comments show his agreement with its principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Poe was also a keen and practical critic, whose criticism was in close relation to his own composition. He practised what he preached and preached what he practised. As early as the introduction to the 1831 edition of his poems, he was thinking out the relation between poetry and prose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A poem, in my opinion, is opposed to a work of science by having for its immediate object, pleasure, not truth; to romance, by having, for its object, an indefinite instead of a definite pleasure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, at this time, when he was just beginning to work upon the short story, the purpose which he set for his narratives was a pleasure like to, but more definite than, the sensuous impression which he had endeavored to achieve by his verse. The nature of this definite pleasure, which was to be the aim of narrative, is clearly explained in the later, and often quoted, criticism of Hawthorne's tales published in &lt;em&gt;Graham's Magazine&lt;/em&gt; for May, 1842.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There Poe maintained that the purpose of short narrative should be &quot;a certain unique or single effect&quot; an effect which could be attained more readily in prose than in verse, because in prose the writer could employ his materials with a freedom which the rhythm of poetry would not permit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these critical dicta, we can deduce his reasons for applying impressionistic methods to the short story. He was a devotee of sensuous poetry and the pleasure which it gave. Hence he wished to secure a like pleasure from prose narrative; but discovered, first, that narrative demanded a more definite pleasure, a more concentrated effect, if a sensuous impression were to result; and next, that prose lent itself far more readily than poetry to the structural changes necessary in order to secure this unique effect and this intense concentration. These discoveries were bound to be made the instant Poe began to carry over his interest in sensuous effects into prose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In poetry there is a connotative value of the word which can never be attained in prose. The word, therefore, is not so powerful when we try to make, not verse, but prose impressionistic, and structure springs instantly to a superior importance. For, as Poe himself pointed out, prose is more flexible than verse, and more readily altered into the sequence and proportion of incident desired. If one tries to put &lt;em&gt;The Ancient Mariner&lt;/em&gt; or Hood's &lt;em&gt;Eugene Aram&lt;/em&gt; into prose, this theory will prove itself, for once the charm of words set in rhythm is lost, the arrangement of the incidents and their proportioning begin to impose tyrannical obligations upon the transposer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe seems to have tried such an experiment, but with new stories instead of old. Busying himself with prose narrative, after he had already solved his problem for verse, he worked out the solution as we have seen it worked out in the two stories already analyzed, securing his &quot;effect&quot; mainly by a newly devised structure, yet not neglecting the careful choice of words, rhythm, and poetical heightening of style. In this way, his theory of poetry, transforming itself to a theory of prose narrative, automatically gave birth to the changes in structure which made possible a new kind of short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This high desire for one intense impression of the idea, the emotion, or the vision of the writer moulds all the greatest tales of Poe, and it alone could have made possible such powerful and artificial stories as &lt;em&gt;Usher&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ligeia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Amontillado&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Black Cat&lt;/em&gt;, and the others of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps an &quot;attentiveness&quot; like that of Ægaeus, a susceptibility to all sensations like Roderick's, qualities to be found in Poe himself, are, to some extent, responsible for the unique success with which these stories proceed unwaveringly to their fearful end. Perhaps this success may also be psychologically connected with that other quality of Poe's brain, his ratiocinative power, which made him the first teller of great detective stories. At all events, the two are united in practice. In &lt;em&gt;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Gold-Bug&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Purloined Letter&lt;/em&gt;, stories which share, and perhaps share predominantly in Poe's reputation as a story-teller, an effort of pure reason has been put into compact and effective story form by the method of construction already developed for his studies in impressionism. The emphasis has been put upon the solution of the mystery, instead of upon a climatic incident as in the tales of the grotesque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the reader will notice, in these ratiocinative stories, sentences, paragraphs, and pages which block the narrative, detract from the total effect, and read like explanatory notes incorporated in the text, a fault of which Poe was never guilty in the tales where his theory of impressionism had uninterrupted sway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;technique-in-poes-short-stories&quot;&gt;Technique in Poe's Short Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is tiresome to be always talking of technique, and yet it is very difficult to speak of Poe and leave technique out of the question. The stories of ratiocination, barring the style, and such a conception as that of M. Dupin, are all technique. The tales of the grotesque would be impossible, so subtle are their effects, without the technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, if we look upon these latter and most characteristic narratives of our author, disengage his conceptions from the results which he attained with them, think over his characters, and regard his setting, one does not feel so sure of Poe's eminence in literature. As a student of personality he knew to its depths only one, his own. That should be enough if he knew it truly. But if abnormal, or viewed abnormally! If warped in the presentation by an attentiveness to the occasional, the merely possible manifestation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roderick Usher, for instance — is he not artificially abnormal? And those projections of Poe's own personality which are imbued with the elixir drawn from his love of certain women: Ligeia, Morelia, Eleanora, is there not in them a certain noxious mixing of dreams, of diseased mind-states, and of reality which precludes, not success, for literature is not anthropology, but the soundest, and highest art of literature?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we are too near Poe to judge, too little advanced even yet on the road of subjective analysis. Or possibly we are too far from the stir of the romantic movement to judge fairly, too little affected by what the next true romanticist will consider the very material for his art. And yet, as we read of Eleanora and the bizarre valley of many scented grasses, of the Gothic chamber where the body of Lady Rowena of Tremaine stirred with the soul of Ligeia, of Montresor who so mockingly left the drunken jester buried alive in his vaults, the doubt will come — in spite of all the magic of narrative, of impressionism, of technique, is this healthy? Is it the material from which great literature is made?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is unfair. Guava, the tropical fruit, is ill-flavored when raw, but it makes the most delicious of jellies. The morbid figures of Poe's imagination, be they untrue, or fabricated from supernormal truth, make you feel the horror, beauty, mystery, or terror of the mind. And they do it whether you like them or not. They accomplish legitimate results, thanks to technique, and that is all that art requires of them. Thus, as is right, we involve Poe's subject-matter with Poe's technique again, and the discussion ends where it began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one detraction to be registered. Whether a fault of his environment — for we remember what Englishmen thought of us, and how banal Englishmen themselves sometimes were — or a defect of his nature, certainly Poe is not always in good taste. For example, in that extravaganza in landscape gardening, &lt;em&gt;The Domain of Arnheim&lt;/em&gt;, there is, for all its beauty, some bad taste. The scenery inclines to the melodramatic, the cluster of Saracenic-Gothic minarets at the heart of the paradise is — well, doubtful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many dialogues, too, throughout the stories, the faint hint comes again, now suggested by a word that is fulsome, now by a description that is overstrained. The fault is not easily pointed out or defined, since it is neither vulgarity nor ostentation, yet now and then, in &lt;em&gt;The Assignation&lt;/em&gt;, in &lt;em&gt;Usher&lt;/em&gt;, in &lt;em&gt;William Wilson&lt;/em&gt;, even in the exquisite &lt;em&gt;Morelia&lt;/em&gt;, one wishes that the rooms were not furnished just so, that the trappings of feudalism were not displayed quite so lavishly, that the college profligate was not quite so crass, black horror painted not quite so thickly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My criticism is intentionally unspecific, for it is hard to pick out one instance without seeming too nice, and impossible to include many. This leads, however, to firmer ground, and explains my neglect of some volumes of Poe's narrative work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a letter of March, 1843, Mrs. Carlyle remarked of humorous stories, &quot;All the books that pretend to amuse in our day come, in fact, either under that category, which you except against, 'the extravagant clown-jesting sort,' or still worse, under that of what I should call the galvanised-death's-head- grinning sort. There seems to be no longer any genuine, heartfelt mirth in writers of books.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe lacked a good sense of humor. What he had was precisely of the clown-jesting or galvanised-death's-head sort, the humor of the school of Hood, whose poorer narratives his own burlesques faintly resemble. Like many another man, he erroneously supposed himself to be funny. He was not, and his lack of taste shows in his vain attempts. At satire he was little better than at mirth, and the tempered excellence of his one successful satiric venture, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Tarr and Prof. Fether&lt;/em&gt;, was due more to the possibilities of its plot than to any satire, latent or otherwise. &quot;Back to your horrors, young man,&quot; Keat's reviewer might have said with justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-master-of-technique-lord-of-the-bizarre&quot;&gt;The Master of Technique, Lord of the Bizarre&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more eulogistic paragraph remains to be added. Like a corona about Poe's serious stories is an effusion of beauty and power — beauty from the solemn, rhythmic style, and the perfect tone of the setting, power from the force of the ideas, the precision of the images even when most fantastic. And this beauty and power is dependent upon no literary influences, upon no development culminating in this one man; it is the flower of his own genius, with a value absolute and for itself. Without other consideration, it gives to Poe's tales a rank among the masterpieces of style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we would hail Poe first as a master of technique; as the great craftsman in English narrative, perhaps the most influential innovator since Richardson. The strong and still increasing flow of literary energy into the channels of the short story opened by his art is witness that he deserves this title. If to the highly organized short narrative which his followers pour out in pursuance of the lessons first taught by him, some of us prefer the simple, unemphatic tale of Chaucer, this means no detraction from the enormous value of his discovery — a value not half-developed as yet in this study — but merely that to Poe, Stevenson, or Kipling, we prefer — Chaucer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, he is also the undisputed lord of the bizarre, the terrible, the mysterious in fiction. The loftiness of his achievement here may sometimes be questioned, not so much, I fancy, on the ground of decadence or abnormality in his subjects, as because of a little bad taste which, like an economic error, has shown itself only many years after commission. But as an expert commanding the resources of fiction, and as an artist supreme in putting into action all that can arouse the terror of the soul, Poe is worthy of the highest and most discriminating praise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

Nevertheless, though born of this school, he had already overtopped its most strenuous efforts.</summary>

&lt;p&gt;According to the Scotch story, the best sermon is not more than twenty minutes long. When Mrs. Hannah More expanded the moral narrative to many pages, she broke the rule, and was supported by the flare-up of English virtue against the atheism and profligacy of the conquering French. But in the magazines, miscellanies, and collections of the English generation contemporary with the Napoleonic period, morality is no longer so completely fashionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current short stories usually leave out the sermon altogether, and the frequent advertisements of &quot;moral tales for children&quot; indicate that Johnsonian narrative had been handed down to girls and boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not surprising, for, in the last decades of the eighteenth century, England had been purged, mentally and socially, by strong draughts of French ideas, and literature was turbulent with romanticism. Thus, at the beginning of the new era, there was more to think of than manners and morals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Novel writers were experimenting in every direction. There was the political, social, or educational novel of Godwin and his group, the Gothic romance, the historical novel, the novel of sensibility. And, although, down to a little after 1800, magazines and all recueils and depositing-places of the short narrative seem to be content with the old apologue, these also began to yield to the change of taste, and present a new, and usually a very bad, short story. ; Bad, because, after the decline of the moral apologue of the eighteenth century, in which short-story writers were free of com-) petition from the novel, came, for a while, only contemptible, vest-pocket versions of Gothic, or historical/ or philosophical novels, and then a flood of feeble experiments in pathos and terror, until Poe gave the new material form. Says the editor of &lt;em&gt;The Lady's Monthly Museum&lt;/em&gt;, under his acknowledgments for July, 1798:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We presume not to dictate to our friends, but Novels, Tales, or Romances, so calculated as not to engage more than three or four pages, will be most acceptable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our friends,&quot; responding with narratives atrociously compressed into the required pages, gave examples of a new romantic short story minus the structure which alone could make it successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the moral story of the previous age did not expire with the year 1800. The aforesaid &lt;em&gt;Lady's Monthly Museum&lt;/em&gt;, from its long life and expensive colored fashion-plates evidently popular and typical, presents its readers with instances well on into the century. As late as 1812, one reads &lt;em&gt;On the Divine Wisdom&lt;/em&gt;. A tale, which, except for some unnecessary horror, and a lack of art, might have come from a deist of the mid-eighteenth century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The works of Maria Edgeworth supply nobler examples of this enduring tendency. One thinks of their author, and rightly, as a novelist. Unlike the puny fry of the magazines, she is in close touch with the thought of the day. Her stories of Irish landholders, of young lady sentimentalists, of every variety of human experience which could illustrate the value of a right education, move with a sweep, a humor, a naturalness, alien to the restricted art of the essayists. Her &lt;em&gt;Popular Tales&lt;/em&gt; (1804), &lt;em&gt;Tales of Fashionable&lt;/em&gt; Life (1809-1812), even the early &lt;em&gt;Moral Tales&lt;/em&gt; (1801), are usually short novels, or novelettes — novelettes, a contemporary writer called such efforts. Yet, as one reads &lt;em&gt;The Prussian Vase&lt;/em&gt;, told to illustrate the dangers of autocracy, or &lt;em&gt;To-Morrow&lt;/em&gt;, where the fault of putting-off ruins the hero (even his story was to have been finished tomorrow!), it is evident that here is the moral apologue still persisting, though stretched to meet new conditions and a more thoroughgoing portrayal of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resemblance to the eighteenth century apologue goes no further, however, than a general unifying of a comparatively short narrative for the sake of a moral. Tone, thought, style are all different. Miss Edgeworth has learned of the novelists, and does not think twice of a hypothetical essay on le_s moeurs_ for once of the story. She takes space to realize her characters; the plots reach a climax, and the subjects are enormously various. With her, moral narrative has enfranchised itself, expanded into the novel, or half-way there; lost its form and structure, while retaining its moral obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her tales may be regarded as the dissolution of the moral apologue due to a too great admixture of life and personality in the beaker. The elements have recompounded into something very excellent indeed — but we must look into far weaker, and far more incoherent narrative for the beginning of the next type of English short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This beginning, in English, was almost inconsiderable. It is to be found in little magazine tales which are very horrible, very sentimental, very pathetic — anything so that the favorite adverb of the romantic movement, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;, may be joined to an adjective which would appeal to a person of sensibility. They reflect the state of mind which the Gothic romancers, and Coleridge, Scott, Byron, Keats, had helped to make for England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signs, not of its strength, but of its weakness, they are only casual experiment in the short tale by those who usually dealt in the long. Fathers die upon the graves of ruined daughters, brother kills brother, sons are drowned in the arms of their forbidden sweethearts. It was at such romantic nonsense that Peacock laughed in &lt;em&gt;Nightmare Abbey&lt;/em&gt; (1818), with its ridiculous Coleridge and absurd Shelley. And before 1818, this emotional tale had grown flagrant enough to be parodied in the very magazines which gave it place. But bad as these stories were, they bore the earmarks of the time, and out of them, and not from the outgrown didactic story, the new development was to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-highly-mysterious-highly-pathetic-tale-1820-to-about-1833&quot;&gt;THE HIGHLY MYSTERIOUS, HIGHLY PATHETIC TALE (1820 TO ABOUT 1833)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mawkishly romantic story of the first decades of the century was the prelude to a performance very extensive and very melancholy for the lover of good short stories. One's state of mind, after reading widely in the magazines and &quot;the accursed annual&quot; of the years that followed, is like that gloom of the spirit which accompanies a particularly bad comic opera. If ever flower bloomed from the dung-heap, it was the exquisite tale of Irving which we have shortly to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writers of short narratives in this age had, usually, but one of three ends in view. Pathos is the deity of &quot;the average contributor,&quot; and the stories in this mood are nearly all mawkish. Horror was increasingly prized, yet seldom wrought successfully into a short story until Poe, in the next period, achieved the art which it required. Mystery accompanies most of the tales, but was effective only when Irving blended with it a little of the humor which was so strangely lacking in other contemporaries of the prime humorists, Lamb, Hook, and Hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &quot;average contributor,&quot; of course, is the one who best represents the onward flow of the narrative fashion of the times, but he printed stories so numerous, and, by modern standards, so abominably written, that a thorough discussion would be mere tediousness. In the magazines, there was Leigh Hunt, who is mentioned in histories of fiction because &lt;em&gt;A Tale for a Chimney Corner&lt;/em&gt;, in his Indicator of December 15, 1819, begins with an explanation of how to write one of the popular &quot;grim stories.&quot; The tale that follows is a poor ghost story, and he does better in the other popular vein, the pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blackwood's&lt;/em&gt; became famous in the third and fourth decades of the century for its &quot;tales of effect,&quot; as Poe called them, although longer narratives seem to have been preferred. One finds some stories of De Quincey's, such as &lt;em&gt;The Avenger&lt;/em&gt; (1838), where, to the popular note of horror, the charm of a beautiful style is added, and only the force which comes with intensity and constructive power is wanting. The old &lt;em&gt;London Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, too, will yield typical examples of the story of the period, in addition to Lamb's half-narrative essays of &lt;em&gt;Elia&lt;/em&gt; which belong to a different genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is the gift-books, or annuals, that present most plentifully, and most typically, the short narrative of this period. The English annual was a combination of the idea of the English special edition in leather for the holiday trade, and the German annual, which latter seems to have had original contributions and blank sheets for memorandums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It began in England about 1823 and reached the height of its popularity in the thirties, when, at the proper season, every lady's table contained some highly-colored Amaranth or Forget-me-not in stamped leather, full of embellishments and contributions in prose and verse by people well known either as litterateurs or as persons of quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the prose was nearly all narrative, and, necessarily, short narrative, the opportunity thus offered to the writers of short stories was only equalled by the development of our more modern fiction-magazines. Mrs. Shelley, Miss Landon (L. E. L.), Emma Roberts, the Banim brothers, were representative contributors to the story list of the annuals. A few words about their stories will serve for all except those of the greater names which we shall reserve for last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Shelley, in spite of the reputation for horror which &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; had left her, deals mainly in pathos. Pitiable Italian girls lose their bandit lovers, unfortunate females, sentimentally guilty of parricide, mourn themselves into a decline, and plunge their lovers and friends into agonized melancholy. Emma Roberts is the paragon of all the defects of the school. Read &lt;em&gt;The Dream in Friendship's Offering&lt;/em&gt; of 1826, which ends, &quot;He turned a hurried glance to the greensward — the grave was full.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miss Landon, whom Lamb would have locked in her room and prevented from writing poetry, mingles the mysterious in her cup of pathos, and sails away on wings of rhetoric which recall the flights of Poe. The mysterious immortal of &lt;em&gt;The Enchantress&lt;/em&gt;, in &lt;em&gt;Heath's Book of Beauty&lt;/em&gt;, 1833, who inhabits, for a time, the body of the Sicilian's bride, almost thrills you — a rare achievement; but no matter where this literary lady soars, the gulfs of sentimentality are always just beneath. The Banims, who had done such good work in their novelettes of Ireland, &lt;em&gt;The O'Hara Tales&lt;/em&gt;, fall into pathos too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particularly sentimental story, &lt;em&gt;The Half-Brothers&lt;/em&gt;, a lachrymose tale of a deserted mother in &lt;em&gt;The Keepsake&lt;/em&gt; for 1829, illustrates, in an exaggerated fashion, the constructive weakness of these dabblers in pathos. After three pages of narrative, &quot;The scene must now be very abruptly changed to the reader, with a breach of the three unities — Twelve years after&quot; — and the story proceeds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One finds little better, and a little worse, in America. N. P. Willis mingles a saving sprightliness in his sentimental stories. Occasionally there is a tale of emigration, of Indian warfare, of the social conditions of the new world, which is refreshingly real, and refreshingly new in setting; but the English trinity, pathos, horror, mystery, were equally supreme on this side of the water. Not even Hawthorne's early stories lift the representative American annual, &lt;em&gt;The Token&lt;/em&gt;, above the level of its English originals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unnecessary to dilate further upon the nature of the average story of this period. The preceding paragraph, hurried summary that it is, will not be wasted if it indicates the quantity and quality of the tales of the annuals and magazines which Poe and Hawthorne were reading when their career began. But we are not yet through with the twenties and early thirties. So far we have discussed only the average contributor. A few exceptional writers mastered their materials and one made classic short stories from the fabric woven by Mrs. Shelley and Emma Roberts with such futility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Walter Scott's big gun boomed only three times for the short story, but we must bring him into the discussion, if only because his poems and novels were the inspiration of so much romantic short narrative. Two of his three worthy short stories are to be found in &lt;em&gt;The Keepsake&lt;/em&gt; for 1829. Another is inserted in his novel, &lt;em&gt;Red Gauntlet&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1824. This last, Wandering &lt;em&gt;Willie's Tale&lt;/em&gt;, is easily the best story outside of Irving to be found in its decade. It is a grim tale, but not a mawkish one, and, save for a considerable delay at the beginning, has little that is not excellent about it. &quot;Forth, pilgrim, forth,&quot; you say to the lovable Steenie who is to play the bagpipes in hell, &quot;be started, man, on thy adventure if thou are to take thy reader with thee! &quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, in this good story, there, is an error in proportions, it is no wonder that, in the contemporary tales of the annuals, one skips ruthlessly to the third page in hopes to find the beginning of the plot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Aunt Margaret's Mirror&lt;/em&gt;, the first of &lt;em&gt;The Keepsake&lt;/em&gt; stories and a moderately good tale of mystery, begins to move with the twelfth page only! &lt;em&gt;The Tapestried Chamber&lt;/em&gt;, a far better one, in which the novelist's great power finds what vent it can in a few pages, rambles sadly at the beginning. The master hand must show its cunning, but Scott's careless methods are deplorably visible in the short story. Yet one must not make the criticism personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Walter, even in such narrow quarters, spins a good grim tale, and escapes all mawkishness. What he does not escape is the other fault common to writers for the annuals — a blindness to proportion, emphasis, what we call form in the short story. His few short tales are an interesting episode, but of no historical importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Village&lt;/em&gt;, by Miss Mitford, was another interesting episode. It is a series of sketches which, appearing in many magazines and annuals, were published afterwards (1824-1832) in collected form, and took a permanent place in our libraries. Her little articles are sometimes descriptions, sometimes mere narratives, occasionally character studies, and less often stories. They were all inspired by a lovable village in southern England, and told in a sympathetic style, which is sometimes stilted, but more often responds to the pleasant, slightly humorous tastes and affections of the writer. These studies are rich in characters, like the village beau, Joel Brent, or the two old-fashioned ladies who had known Richardson; they are rich in local circumstance, and in faithful portraiture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Geoffrey Crayon,&quot; says Miss Mitford in Bramley Maying, &quot;has, in his delightful but somewhat fanciful writings, brought into general view many old sports and customs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is of the Irving of &lt;em&gt;The Sketch Book&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bracebridge Hall&lt;/em&gt; that these sketches, with their pleasant antiquarianism, their quaintly humorous descriptions, and gentle pathos, are reminiscent. One notes that Geoffrey Crayon was too fanciful! Miss Mitford, in truth, is a realist, though no stern one. She was in sympathy, as she says, with Jane Austen; out of sympathy, as one sees, with the brood of romantic story-tellers into whose hands the short story had fallen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one looks over the annuals, her cool, quiet sentences, her life-like pictures, with only the romance of an already passing life to warm them, are refreshing after the livid intensities of other contributors. But it required more technique than Miss Mitford, or any contemporary, was master of, to make good short stories, valuable for their narrative mainly, from realistic studies of dove-colored life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far as Miss Mitford was a story-teller at all, she stood aside from the romantic development which was leading towards the achievement of technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this romantic development, Washington Irving is the chief master of all this group of short-story writers. There is no prose short story in this period which does not reveal inferiority, and often an abysmal inferiority, when tried by the touchstone of Rip Van Winkle, or &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&lt;/em&gt;. Miss Mitford was never a born narrator; Scott, the well-head of English romantic fiction, could do &quot;the great bow-wow,&quot; but not, in such perfection, these shorter sketches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the tribe of the annuals, in substance only do they reveal themselves of the same age; in manner they are &lt;em&gt;canaille&lt;/em&gt; to an aristocrat of letters. Amidst all the welter of pathetico-mystico slush which filled the periodicals of these years, an obscure American suddenly elevates the popular kind of short story into masterpieces which belong to our permanent literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical problem is a nice one. First, just what did Irving accomplish when he wrote the best of his stories; next, how did he accomplish it; and, finally, what is the place of his achievement in the evolution we are tracing? The materials are in &lt;em&gt;The Sketch Book&lt;/em&gt; (1819- 20), &lt;em&gt;The Tales of a Traveller&lt;/em&gt; (1824), and &lt;em&gt;The Alhambra&lt;/em&gt; (1832), in which three works his most noteworthy contributions to the short story were contained. The dates, as well as the contents, show how closely his chief work fits into this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;the-simple-unemphatic-tale--no-whit-inferior-to-the-highly-artificial-mechanism&quot;&gt;The Simple, Unemphatic Tale – No Whit Inferior to the Highly Artificial Mechanism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, just what was it that Irving did accomplish? There is a disposition, in contemporary criticism, to disparage the first American writer who became &quot;classic.&quot; The tendency shows itself by implication, rather than in the open, and seems to result from the sudden rush to appreciate the modern short story. Irving certainly did not achieve the &quot;short story,&quot; or short-story, or Short Story, as the modern product has been variously written down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Baldwin has aptly suggested in this connection, that if Rip Van Winkle should be retold today it would be a very different narrative. The return of old Rip to his village would be the situation chosen for emphasis by the narrator; the Catskill episodes would sink to mere foothills of antecedent action; the confusion of the returned hunter would rise to the heights of climax. Indeed, it is true that the technique which has put so many hitherto unconsidered situations into literature, and the short-story form, was not in Irving's grasp, or, better, was unknown to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, since nothing could be more different in artistic purpose than these idyllic tales of the Hudson River Dutch and the stories of Poe, Harte, or Kipling, nothing is more useless than to compare their technique to the detriment of either. Intensity, emphasis, excerption of a single situation is the aim of the more modern storytellers; breadth within limits, balance of parts, an easy telling of several related incidents, the accomplishment of the first American master of the tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When successful, the simple, unemphatic, but well-balanced tale is no whit inferior to the highly artificial mechanism of &lt;em&gt;The Cask of Amontillado&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; — it is merely different. The simpler structure was less sure of success in a few pages; witness the many good plots spoiled in these early decades. But Irving mastered this simplicity and made it successful; restrained pathos, mystery, and sentiment with humor; balanced the fashionable introduction with the requisite weight of story; carried fluency and restraint to the end. He may be said to have discharged his debt to the rhetorician; and, though he did not achieve the modern short story, it is not impossible that his particular success, the proportioning of the simple tale, may belong to a more durable variety of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second question, What made him so successful with the simple tale while his contemporaries were crowding the periodicals with failures? is not so easily answered. Perhaps humor was the talisman which saved Irving from contagion; that gentle, urbane humor which smiles from behind Ichabod Crane and Rip. It must have been a sense of humor that restrained him from the excesses of the average contributor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply a theme which, lending itself to sentiment, forbade the humorous, and he stopped just short of the common complaint of the annuals. The &lt;em&gt;Pride of the Village&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Sketch Book&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Young Italian&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;The Tales of a Traveller&lt;/em&gt;, are unhumorous — and on the brink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we know his better stories too well, and the current narrative of the period too little, for a full appreciation of the value, in such a time, and amidst such work, of Irving's quality of humor. If so, an indirect illustration will bring the moral home. In Friendship's Offering for 1826, there are two anonymous tales, &lt;em&gt;The Laughing Horseman&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Reichter and his Staghounds&lt;/em&gt;; hearty tales, with a jolly mystery, a setting that makes you visualize it, and a style full of vigor and beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irving's, you guess instantly, for you think you feel his characteristic touch, and are impressed by the infinite superiority to everything else in the collection. But the next number (1827) tells the secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a better story still, &lt;em&gt;Der Kugelspieler&lt;/em&gt;, in the same spirit, style, and vein, and by the author of &lt;em&gt;The Chronicles of London Bridge&lt;/em&gt;. This was Richard Thomson, the librarian and antiquary, who pretty certainly wrote the first two stories, since the editor of the 1826 annual had promised that certain anonymities should be revealed in the next issue. Now this forgotten author has written the very best stories in the English annuals, let Scott's (barring Wandering Willie's Tale) or any be compared with them. &lt;em&gt;Der Kugelspieler&lt;/em&gt; will serve for an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It deals with the sardonic goblin, Forster der Wilder, and how upon the ghastly kugelplatz of ancient Barbarossa he outbowled the student of Prague. There is no lack of mystery, no lack of the marvelous when, for an instant, the court of the great red-beard look down from their misty, ruined towers upon the match. And yet a humorous point of view acts, in this narrative, as an antiseptic against the absurd, and a preservative of verisimilitude in the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rip Van Winkle, the tale which it most resembles in English, is a classic; &lt;em&gt;Der Kugelspieler&lt;/em&gt; is buried with its unworthy companions in a forgotten annual. Thus we may see with unbiassed eye what a mighty difference came about when one of these romanticists of the second generation compounded his pathos, his horror, or his mystery, with the aid of a sense of humor. Humor saved Richard Thomson, at least from artistic nullity; and humor saved Irving from the quagmire in which his contemporaries floundered, as Kipling hopes it will save all of us Americans in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is another reason for the success of the American writer in the exquisitely simple, perfectly balanced tale, a reason which regards the structure as much as the contents of the story. It must be set forth in order to relate his work to the development of the short story, as well as to complete the explanation of his triumph. This reason is to be found in the nature of the models upon which he formed his style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question, Where did Irving learn his art? may be answered, to the degree in which answer is possible, with ease and rapidity. The bent of his genius is in exact conformity with his age. He is a late romantic, he belongs to the generation after the Gothic romance, the generation of the historical romance, and the pathetic, ghastly, mysterious tale. His subjects are those of his times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But his method, his style, his view-point differ, as has been somewhat extensively indicated, from those of his contemporaries. This difference must certainly be ascribed in part to his well-known fondness for the literature of the early eighteenth century. No argument is needed to prove a general influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The form of &lt;em&gt;The Sketch Book&lt;/em&gt; is reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;The Spectator&lt;/em&gt;, and Bracebridge Hall was evidently inspired by Sir Roger de Coverley; Irving's style is Addisonian; his humor has an Augustan urbanity; he is inclined to study manners in a very eighteenth century fashion. If his interests stamp him romanticist, his manner as certainly marks him a student and often an imitator of the age of Pope, Steele, and Addison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, to these obvious debts, I would add one more. The resemblance between the periodical narrative of the eighteenth century and these perfectly balanced tales of Irving has been noticed only as far as their characters, Will Wimble and Rip, the squire of Bracebridge Hall and Sir Roger, betray evidences of kinship. It goes much deeper. We will not presume to say that Irving learned his proportioning sense of humor from &lt;em&gt;The Spectator&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Tatler&lt;/em&gt;, although doubtless he was not uninfluenced by the Queen Anne temperament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is notable and significant that one finds the balance, the restraint, the exact adaptation of means to end, precisely what the short stories of the romanticists lacked, precisely what Irving attained, in the periodical narratives of the early eighteenth century which were his early and revered reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put the question this way. How would a close student and admirer of the narratives of &lt;em&gt;The Spectator&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;The Rambler&lt;/em&gt;, treat a romantic story of pathetic love, a mysterious legend, or any example of the narratives most cherished in Irving's day? Would he be mawkish in the telling, extravagant, grossly improbable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could he be, with such models!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A theoretical application of an eighteenth century manner to the romantic tale of Miss Roberts in the annual before me, gives, to the assertion that he could not, a pragmatic value. Most certainly Irving was a romanticist, but, quite as certainly, he learned order, restraint, and symmetry from the masters of the short story in the eighteenth century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This criticism, so far, may seem to be a narrow one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been based upon only two stories, the Dutch tales of &lt;em&gt;The Sketch Book&lt;/em&gt;. But these are the best as well as the earliest of Irving's successful narratives. He never afterwards reached their level. He often fell far below it. In &lt;em&gt;The Tales of a Traveller&lt;/em&gt;, the reader sometimes finds the author descending to the merely pathetic or only mysterious of his contemporaries; in the excellent legends of &lt;em&gt;The Alhambra&lt;/em&gt;, the virtues above recorded are repeated in a more romantic medium, but, on the whole, with less complete success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irving's popularity as a story-teller began in 1820. His success was as great in England as in America. After 1820, therefore, one expects more examples of well-balanced tales of mystery or pathos in either country, but, in the first decade, looks almost vainly. William Austin's &lt;em&gt;Peter Rugg&lt;/em&gt; (1824) is a striking exception, perhaps the only notable instance in America before 1830. In England, there is John Sterling, whose allegorical, half-mystical, and sometimes altogether beautiful tales, are of a far different kind of romanticism, and will come up for discussion later; Scott, who only experimented; and Richard Thomson, for whom it is probably too late to get a due need of praise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romanticism of an advanced and rather unhealthy kind befogged all but this handful of short-story tellers and kept down the average of achievement. It was not the German romanticism of Tieck, Fouque, and their compatriots. This had scarcely arrived as yet. Indeed, Carlyle's preface to his 1827 translations from these writers shows that he thought himself to be the introducer of a new genre into English literature. And he was — for very few examples seem to have appeared in English before this time of the romantic story with an idea behind it so characteristic of German romanticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, the romance in the stories of the native annuals and magazines of this early period was a blend of three distinctly English elements. One of these was gross, one substantial, one exquisite. The Gothic romance of Mrs. Radcliffe, Monk Lewis, and their followers, supplied much of the coarser terror, the extravagance, and the unreality of the &quot;average contributor,&quot; whose innumerable tales we endeavored just now to dispose of in a single paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott, as novelist, is the substantial element, but, except in the historical anecdote, it is surprising to see how unavailing were his healthy methods to save the little fellows among his contemporaries from the banal in their stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third element is the most intangible, perhaps the most important. It came from the romanticism of the great poets who, stirred on by the same romantic movement, had been building up throughout this period a new era in English verse. Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Byron, Hood, to a far less degree Wordsworth, are indirectly responsible for some of the mawkish sentimentality, pathos, unrestrained horror, and sensibility of these short stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exquisitely sentimental tales of Keats, the weird narratives of Coleridge, the morbidly pathetic romances of Byron, all belong to the years preceding or included in the period just chronicled. A pure flame of romance kindled such sparks from the fine minds of the poets; in contact with grosser spirits, this flame, intensified by the poetry through which it passed, threw down a precipitate of ridiculously overstrained prose narrative. Of the few worthy writers mentioned, Miss Mitford was saved from this disaster by her leanings towards rural realism, John Sterling because he was a poet himself, Scott by his own sane genius, Irving by his eighteenth century clarity, composure, and humor. He alone was able so to blend these many influences as to make a really great short story in such a time, and only one disciple seems to have followed successfully after him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet evil may lead to good. It was the extravagance rather than the restraint of this tumultuous period which gave an opportunity to the next great American story-teller.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">In the last decades of the eighteenth century, England had been purged, mentally and socially, by strong draughts of French ideas, and literature was turbulent with romanticism. Thus, at the beginning of the new era, there was more to think of than manners and morals. Novel writers were experimenting in every direction. There was the political, social, or educational novel of Godwin and his group, the Gothic romance, the historical novel, the novel of sensibility.</summary>

&lt;p&gt;The point at which any true appreciation of the short story begins is the clear perception that it is a distinct form of art; and the reason why the older novelists so rarely succeeded in the short story is that they did not apprehend this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we bear in mind the three principles, that the short story must be complete in itself, that it is short because it cannot be long, and that it consists of a single incident, we can readily apply a critical test, which, while not infallible, nevertheless affords a valuable means of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us take the test of completeness and apply it to Dickens's exquisite story of &quot;Boots at the Holly Tree Inn.&quot; The story as Dickens writes it straggles over a great variety of themes. We have an embittered lover, a detailed description of a mail-coach journey, of a snow-storm, of an inn, of his own ennui, of his own curious imaginings, elaborated in thousands of words, before he reaches the real story which the Boots at the Holly Tree has to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No fewer than thirty-seven pages consist of extraneous matter, while the story itself is told in thirteen pages. It is not until the Boots begins to speak that the story begins; up to this point we are engaged in the tedious reflections of Charles Dickens, mixed with a great amount of totally irrelevant detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dickens himself must have been conscious of these defects, for when he prepared the story for a public reading he ruthlessly cut away all about the mail-coach, the snow-storm, the struggling horses, and so forth, and came at once to the incident which the Boots repeats with so much humor and pathos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why, then, did he not write the story in this form? Simply because he had not grasped the principle that a short story must be complete in itself. The moment he brought his work to the test of oral and dramatic delivery this principle was discovered clearly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it may be added that there is no better test of any story than to read it aloud. When a story is read aloud, the interest of the hearer is in exact proportion to the direct appeal of the story; and the inattention of the hearer is the sure indication of the lack of direct appeal. The hearer of a spoken story resents everything in the nature of excrescence; he finds mere description tedious; he is intent only on the living issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dickens discovered this when he submitted his work to an oral test; the true short-story writer will not need such a test to teach him the law of dramatic completeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast let us take such a story as Kipling's &quot;Matter of Fact,&quot; not because it is his best story, but because here also there is a great amount of description. But with Kipling the description is vital to the story, whereas in Dickens it is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story begins abruptly with a rapid sketch of three journalists on a tramp steamer making for Southampton. The dramatic note is instantly struck in the cry of the sweating steersman that something is wrong with the sea, that it is bewitched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To describe this sea, with its oily surface, its sudden inexplicable upheaval and run of gray water, is legitimate aid, because it is all necessary to the fearful apparition of the wounded sea-serpent, flung up from the ice-cold depths of ocean by the explosion of a submarine volcano. And although the story ends in London, yet its unity is never violated; and, more wonderful still, although it ends in ridicule and humor, yet its impression of horror is not destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case Kipling's powers of description do not hinder his story; they are not felt to be excrescence; and for this reason; that they are vitally necessary to the theme. We do not need the snow-storm and the mail-coach to explain the eloping children in Dickens's story; we do need the horror of the bewitched sea to explain the state of mind in the three journalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can cut away three-fourths of Dickens's story, as he himself did when he made it a public reading, without essential loss, and indeed with positive gain; we cannot spare a single sentence of Kipling's without deterioration of the total effect. The one does not obey the law of essential completeness and the other does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us apply the second test, that the short story is short because it cannot be long. A good example of the reverse of this principle may be found in Hardy's great tale of &quot;The Withered Arm.&quot; It is a most dramatic story and may rank among the great achievements of Hardy's genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It concerns a group of persons, each drawn with vital truth; a farmer who brings home a young and sweet woman as his bride; a wronged woman, who has a son by the farmer, and a wise man or wizard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bride's arm withers and she loses the love of her husband. The illegitimate son commits arson and is condemned to death. The young wife goes to the gaol that she may put her withered arm on the neck of a man newly hanged, having been told by the wizard that this is an ancient form of cure. The hanged man is her husband's son, and she meets her husband as he stands overwhelmed with grief and contrition beside his son's corpse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a story capable of great elaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considered only as a plot, it is as full of dramatic possibilities as &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles.&quot; Obviously it might have been treated with the same fulness; all that is needed is an elaboration of incidents, such as Hardy excels in; as, for example, the previous history of the wronged woman, the events leading up to the marriage of the farmer, the character of the outcast son and the general background of country life and manners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So treated, it might have taken rank with the greatest of Hardy's novels; Hardy chose to compress it within the limits of forty pages. But this compression is purely arbitrary. Its result is an abbreviated novel, but not a short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single incident of the woman visiting the gaol to find a cure for her disease in a horrible experiment, sanctioned by superstition, might have composed a legitimate short story; as it is the result is a miniature novel, which has all the characteristics of the novel except its length and none of the features of a short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we contrast with this Quiller-Couch's story of &quot;The Drawn Blind,&quot; we at once see the difference in method. Here also we have the story of a son who is hanged and the pathetic invulnerable faith of the mother in his innocence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two persons, in their mutual relations, compose the entire story. The mother is so certain of the acquittal of her son that she has prepared a feast for him on his release; when the fatal verdict is announced, she extinguishes the lights and drops the blind. That is all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is obviously not enough material here for a novel; but there is just enough for a successful short story. Spread out into a novel the interest could not be sustained; and the incident itself is so dramatic that any additional incidents would weaken the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as a short story it is perfect. It could be told in no other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this we may take as a sufficing test. Of the short story proper, it is always true that it could be nothing else but what it is. If it could just as well have been elaborated into a novel, it is not a short story, but only a novel in miniature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this gives sanction to the third principle of the short story—viz., that it consists not of several related incidents, but of one incident. In a sense this is untrue to nature, because in actual life every incident is related to some other incident, of which it is either the cause or the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one can pluck a rose without investigating the secrets of its growth, and it is not necessary to trace that growth through all the series of its vicissitudes in order to be aware of its charm, its color or its fragrance. If art violates nature in giving us the unrelated incident, it is for the sound reason that art leaves much to the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may know too much as well as too little for a just appreciation of art. The great artist is he who knows how to interest without fatiguing us; who gives us just enough knowledge of his theme to invest with overwhelming significance what he chooses to reveal; who makes one's imagination the confederate with his own by leaving us to supply much which he only suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus Dickens fails in the story already described, because he tells us more than we want to know; and many other writers fail by attempting to blend several incidents instead of centralizing the attention on one. Hardy fails for the same reason in &quot;The Withered Arm,&quot; considered as a short story; he gives us a series of incidents legitimate enough in a novel, but confusing in a short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Kipling succeeds in the best of his stories by his perfect centrality of aim. He has a single situation to depict, and he is not distracted from it for a moment by any side issues. We do not want to know anything more about his three pressmen who see the dying sea-serpent than what he chooses to tell us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central incident is the sea-serpent, and the central interest is the effect on each man's mind of what he sees. Had he told us how the three men came together, how one had gone in quest of gold to South Africa, and another had fought in a native war, and the third had explored the mountains of the Moon, however vividly he might have written, he would nevertheless have spoiled his story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No amount of fine writing could have atoned for confusion of interest. The finest writing in a short story is that which takes us quickest to the very heart of the matter in hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most characteristic note of the short story is then immediacy. It is of its very essence that it should be dramatic from the start. If it fails to arrest attention with its first paragraph it is likely to fail altogether. It affords no opportunity for that slow building-up of character and situation which is common in the practice of the novelist's art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method which is perfectly legitimate and even compulsory to the novelist is wholly impossible to the short-story writer. The short story stands related to the novel very much as the vivid impressionist sketch does to the painstaking picture. The picture is built up by months of toil; its final harmony is the result of thousands of little strokes, of much stippling and repainting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the sketch is achieved with a full brush in a confident hand and conveys its impression instantly. Oscar Wilde once said of Kipling's stories that they were &quot;life seen by flashes of vulgarity.&quot; One may ignore the charge of vulgarity, but there is no doubt about the flash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was by virtue of this incomparable directness, this rapid confident brush-work, that Kipling at once arrested the attention of the public. &quot;His name was Charlie Mears&quot;—so Kipling begins what he calls &quot;The Finest Story in the World&quot; without preface, without preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No wonder the literary scribes and pharisees were offended in him. According to their traditions, all stories should begin by a leisurely approach, and there was something almost brutal in this abruptness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ancient school of landscape art in the same way had a tradition that there was a certain place in a landscape where a brown tree must appear, and the tradition was held sacred until suddenly Turner startled the world with masses of living color in which no brown tree appeared. From that hour landscape art was revolutionized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a similar revolution of literary ideals has followed the triumph of the short-story writer. He has taught the novelists themselves the value of immediacy, and, while the novelist of the older school still clings to the law of slow approach, almost all the newer writers have learned how to cut away preliminaries and to get at the heart of their story with a celerity which would have scandalized the writers of an earlier generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must not be assumed, however, that because the short story occupies but a small canvas it is therefore inferior to the novel, for this would constitute bulk as the standard of value. The entire witness of art, in all its branches, is hostile to such a conclusion. A fine intaglio may be as great a work of art as a Grecian statue; a square foot of Gerald Dow's painting is much more valuable than one of Haydon's interminable yards of canvas; and a lyric of a dozen lines of Burns is much more precious than a hundred epical pages of &quot;The Earthly Paradise.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that it is much more difficult to write a perfect short story than a successful novel. It demands superior gifts of concentration, of ingenuity, of fantasy, of originality, of dramatic intensity, of exquisite craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novel can afford to have its lapses, its relatively dull moments, its pages of reflection; it even gains by them, for they afford a necessary contrast to its dramatic climax. But the short story can afford to have nothing of the kind. The eagerness of its movement must be continuous and sustained. And this is, perhaps, why the regular novelist so rarely succeeds in the short story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His entire training is against him. He is usually too deliberate, too discursive; his touch is not light enough, his method is not sufficiently rapid. He frequently betrays his ignorance of his medium at every turn. He writes condescendingly or reluctantly; he makes us feel that he grudges throwing away a good motif; or he adopts some purely mechanical device, such as combining a series of episodes, which are neither in themselves short stories nor in their combination a true novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter method was adopted by Barrie in his &quot;Window in Thrums&quot; and by Ian Maclaren in his &quot;Bonnie Briar Bush.&quot; The result is not unpleasant; but the various episodes do not stand by themselves and therefore are not short stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For no writer will ever succeed in the art of the short story who does not thoroughly understand that it is a form of art wholly separate from any other; and that it is also a form of art which is at once so difficult and delicate that it worthily challenges the highest qualities of genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regards the throwing away of a good motif, it is undoubtedly true that a man cannot enter on the career of the short-story writer who is parsimonious in motifs. But the extravagance is more apparent than real, for the reason that the motif which makes a great short story can rarely be utilized in any other way. It is possible to expand a short story into a novel; Mr. A. E. W. Mason has done it successfully in &quot;The Four Feathers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to transform it into a play; Mr. Jerome has done it in the &quot;Passing of the Third Floor Back.&quot; But such instances must be ranked with the exceptions. As a rule, the essential factor in a great short story is that it can be expressed in no other way with anything like the same success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would attempt to create a novel out of Kipling's sea-serpent story, out of the &quot;Incarnation of Khrisna Mulvaney,&quot; out of &quot;The Finest Story in the World&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognize at once how impossible such a feat would be. And therein lies both the claim and the justification of the short story. Life consists both of prolonged sequences and of flashing episodes. The first afford the material of the novelist, the second of the short-story writer. And life is so rich in episode to the observant and adventurous that he is much more likely to suffer from embarrassment of material than from poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be true that all the plots of the novelist have been used before, but that is only because the novelist persists in the use of a certain type of plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the episodical wealth of life is inexhaustible. A year's study of a daily newspaper may furnish the short-story writer with more material than he is likely to utilize in a lifetime. A face seen in a crowd, gossip overheard in a tavern, a conversation at a street door, the revelations of hostile eyes in meeting or in parting, the sudden passing of insignificant men and women across the beam of his questing searchlight—these are enough to excite his imagination, to start the wheels of fantasy; and if he will but continue to see vividly the dramatic possibilities of life, and to report truthfully what he sees, he need never lack material for the warp and woof of the stories he can spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chaptertitle&quot; id=&quot;ingenuity-adventure-horror-three-types-of-modern-short-stories&quot;&gt;Ingenuity, Adventure, Horror: Three Types of Modern Short Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So long as the three-volume novel reigned supreme and magazines held to the tradition of the long serial, there was neither opportunity nor motive for the British writer to practise the art of short-story writing. But the conditions which repressed the short story in England acted powerfully for its benefit in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we investigate the position of the American writer of fiction of the last century some extremely interesting facts are noticeable. The chief of these facts is that almost all the novels read by the American public were of British origin. There was no international copyright law, and the most that a British novelist could do to secure any reward from America was to sell advance sheets of his book to an American publisher. Obviously this was a very exiguous device to protect his interests. It broke down the moment his book was pirated, which it invariably was within a few weeks of its publication in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only was it pirated, but sold broadcast at extremely low prices. It is patent that the American novelist had no chance at all in this competition. Who would buy the work of a native author of local fame when he could purchase for a trifle the latest novel of Dickens or Thackeray?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result was that there was a very poor market for native fiction. The pirate publisher of those days did a great deal more than injure the British author by robbing him of his just reward; he injured yet more fatally the American author by robbing him of all chance of successful authorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driven from the field of legitimate fiction by unjust competition, there was but one road to success left open to him—the magazine and the short story. Here, at least, he was free from rivalry, for here was a demand which could not be supplied from British sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it was to the short story that the rising school of American writers of fiction devoted their attention. Among these writers Washington Irving and Hawthorne and Poe stand supreme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irving excelled in the brief sketch rather than the short story proper. It is only at a certain heat of the creative faculty that he attains pure narrative. Grave, wise, genial, he is apt to write with leisurely ease, in a mood of reflection rather than with directness and intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawthorne displays the same tendency, though in a much less degree. He is apt to delay his dramatic moment by philosophical observation, to be tediously analytical when the theme demands intensity, to stifle the fire of his imagination under a dull weight of pedantry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may even be said that Hawthorne's true and fine genius often appears to work in some obstructive medium; at least that is the impression which he frequently produces on the reader. It may have been distrust of his own powers, a kind of intellectual shyness, a native difficulty in speaking out. It may have arisen in large degree from his own inborn habits of introspection and metaphysical analysis. It may have consisted of a constantly changing combination of all these forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever it was, it was there, a resisting medium which gives the sense of effort to his work. In all his best work he conquers this obstruction. And in the short story he is at his best. His outstanding claim is that he applies a profound psychology to the art of fiction. He deals not with the surfaces of life, but with the depths. He delights in the exploration of what Arthur Hallarn called &quot;the abysmal depths of personality.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has a keen eye for the dramatic moment. His themes are uniformly significant and often of extraordinary fascination. In all that concerns the technique of the short story he is a great master. This technical excellence has been again and again recognized, and by later critics so completely that they have unhesitatingly chosen some of Hawthorne's stories as the perfect models of what a short story ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the true creator of the modern short story in American literature is neither Irving nor Hawthorne; that honor belongs to Poe. Poe brought to his task precisely those gifts most essential to achievement; a powerful reason of unusual subtlety, an imagination of extraordinary vividness, a faculty of observation only less extraordinary, and, above all, a mind wholly free, wholly unfettered by tradition and almost insolently scornful of accepted canons. His self-confidence is superb; in a man less singularly gifted it would have been ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His originality is unquestioned; and the witness to this originality is found in the fact that he was the first man to recognize completely the artistic possibilities of the short story. He found in it a sufficient vehicle for the expression of his genius. He brought to it the highest and rarest genius not only of his age, but of his nation. Both in poetry and in short-story writing Poe stands first in the literature of America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe excelled equally in three kinds of story: the story of ingenuity, the story of adventure and the story of horror. To take the first, what stories have surpassed in ingenuity the &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; and the &quot;Purloined Letter&quot;? Here we have in its perfection the method of deduction which Conan Doyle has so successfully copied in his Sherlock Holmes. The same ingenuity, differently applied, distinguishes the great story of &quot;The Gold-Bug.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many writers have since used cryptograms and concealed in them the secrets of hidden treasure, but there is not one who has ever surpassed Poe in this kind of story. The &quot;Descent into the Maelstrom&quot; and the &quot;Adventure of Hans Pfaall&quot; are equally unique examples of the story of adventure. The latter found an imitator in Jules Verne, but the Frenchman's &quot;Voyage to the Moon &quot; is a dreary pedestrian performance compared with the imaginative daring of Poe's narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the story of horror no one has ever pretended to rival him; and it may be questioned if Stevenson would ever have written &quot;Markheim&quot; had not Poe first written the &quot;Tell-Tale Heart.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mere fact that we can thus trace the influence of Poe among the most recent and the greatest of modem story-writers is conclusive evidence of his profound originality. His was a truly seminal mind fecund with ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without models, without a single counselling voice and without any real recognition or encouragement, he discovered the value of the short story, endowed it with form and method, devoted his rare gifts to its perfection and did each of these things so completely that his own stories have become classic, the value of his method has never been disputed and the form which he gave the short story has become the model of succeeding writers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, however, the chief contribution of Poe to the art of the short story lies not so much in form or method as in fantasy. Thus in the &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue &quot; he fails in immediacy. Again, in &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; the interest is wrought to the highest pitch when the treasure is found, and the explanation of the cryptogram, infinitely ingenious as it is, coming after the finding of the treasure, has the effect of an anti-climax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kipling, telling the same story, would probably have commenced with the discovery of the cryptogram and have found a true climax in the finding of the treasure. But this is, after all, to say no more than that the technique of the short story has advanced with the practice of the art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unique claim of Poe is that he endowed the short story with fantasy. He gave it wings, opened the heavens of imagination to it, made it almost a form of poetry and put it on the highest level of literary art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One fault he had which cannot be excused; he took a morbid delight in the horrible. This is a constant temptation to the short-story writer. It arises from the need to produce an instant and deep impression; and such an impression is most readily produced by an illicit appeal to fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stevenson makes this appeal in &quot;Thrawn Janet&quot;; Kipling in many of his stories, notably &quot;The Return of Imray&quot;; Fanu almost always. In going over the vast literature of short stories, it has been a surprise to the writer to discover how many of them are stories of pure terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That such stories may have qualities of art is undeniable; yet simply because the appeal to terror is so easily made, it is a kind of appeal which should be very sparingly used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use which Poe makes of it is constant and therefore illicit. This is his chief fault. Yet against it must be reckoned his extraordinary power of fantasy, and this gift raises his worst theme into the realm of the creative imagination. Poe was essentially a poet, a poet whose genius moved habitually on the darker side of life and was deeply tainted by the morbid and the abnormal. It is because he was so essentially a poet that even an illicit theme is redeemed by the wonderful splendor of the imagination with which he bathes it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For, after all, technique is not everything, a truth upon which some insistence needs to be laid today because its value is often overestimated. Thus, for example, in what must certainly be reckoned as one of the greatest of all Kipling's stories, &quot;The Man Who would be King,&quot; there is a wilful disregard of the law of immediacy which he uses in many shorter stories with such superb effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story has three distinct episodes. The first concludes on the railway station at Marwar Junction when he delivers Camehan's enigmatic message to the red-bearded man in the second-class compartment. The second begins in the newspaper office when Camehan and Dravot unfold their daring plan of becoming Kings and ends with the starting of the Afghan caravan. The third, which contains the real story, occurs three years later, when Camehan relates the marvellous adventures of himself and Dravot in Kafiristan, and concludes with that noble touch of fantasy when Camehan stands in the blinding sun singing:&lt;/p&gt;

His blood-red banner streams afar Who follows in His train.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laws of technique are violated, but surely it would be the merest pedantry to insist that therefore this is not a true short story. The sympathetic reader, thrilled with its pathos and its daring, astonished by its imaginative power, conscious of its Homeric bigness, will at once reply that it is at all events a great story, that it is indeed among the greatest of all stories in the English tongue, and he would be right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, technique is not everything. It is no more than the servant of the shaping creative force and must not be allowed to be its master. If it be not elastic enough to serve the end of the creative force, that force will certainly discard and transcend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By all means let the writer study technique; it is as useful to him as the life class and the art school are to the artist. But let him also recollect that technique alone never yet made a great artist. It is at best but the weapon of success; for while a writer may succeed with an imperfect knowledge of technique, it is certain that he cannot succeed without the creative imagination. To forget this is to magnify the lesser things of the law and to forget the eternal verities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is but to say in plainer language that in all forms of literary art, it is personality that counts for most. Great writing is always the expression of great personality. It is well to be acquainted with the unities of composition, but if that is all we know nothing awaits us but barrenness and failure. When a Shakespeare arises, he pours such floods of flame into the old dramatic forms that they are utterly dissolved, and none regret them but the pedants, with whom form counts for more than spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, as elsewhere, it is the letter that killeth, it is the spirit that giveth life. The cardinal questions to be addressed to a writer of short stories are these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has he any vital message to communicate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has he any sincere experience to impart?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has he seen life for himself, from his own angle of vision, and seen it truthfully and completely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has he the creative force that makes us see what he sees, feel what he has felt, comprehend what he has comprehended?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the inexorable questions, and the greatest writers of short stories have been those who could answer them most thoroughly. Such interrogations are not to be evaded on the plea of technique; personality transcends technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short story, more than any other form of literature, must have individuality; and to have it, it must be impregnated with the personality of the writer. It is from this source that it derives its color, its charm, its power to arrest and please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poe and Kipling, Stevenson and Hawthorne, write nothing that is not impregnated with personality, and this is the deepest secret of their fame. The most miraculous color in the picture is always that which is derived from the life-blood of the artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;theend&quot;&gt;~ The End ~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

        <summary type="html">The point at which any true appreciation of the short story begins is the clear perception that it is a distinct form of art; and the reason why the older novelists so rarely succeeded in the short story is that they did not apprehend this. If we bear in mind the three principles, that the short story must be complete in itself, that it is short because it cannot be long, and that it consists of a single incident, we can readily apply a critical test, which, while not infallible, nevertheless affords a valuable means of discrimination.</summary>
