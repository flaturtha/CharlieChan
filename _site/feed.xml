					<description>This is Martin Colby’s story, not mine. Three of us heard him tell it &amp;mdash; Willoughby, the eminent English clergyman, who is now filling a number of lecture engagements in this country, Mosby, the attorney, and myself—and we are all firmly convinced that he spoke the truth. I write it just as he gave it to us.</description>

					<description>There are thousands of tons of gold locked up in God's eternal mountains which men will never see nor spend. But that fact doesn't keep them from trying. There is something about yellow metal which turns heads, transforms morals and grows devils in the soil of saints.</description>

					<description>Detective Sullivan thought he had an air-tight murder charge against Francis Small. Clearly, he had poisoned his wealthy aunt in order to get her money, and Sullivan was confident his evidence would convict the ambitious young man … And then something happened, something quite unexpected, that completely upset Sullivan’s case … By a pretty piece of detective work he trapped the real murderer — and provided Tom Curry with a good story plot.</description>
