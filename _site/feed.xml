					<description>Detective Sullivan thought he had an air-tight murder charge against Francis Small. Clearly, he had poisoned his wealthy aunt in order to get her money, and Sullivan was confident his evidence would convict the ambitious young man … And then something happened, something quite unexpected, that completely upset Sullivan’s case … By a pretty piece of detective work he trapped the real murderer — and provided Tom Curry with a good story plot.</description>
