Thus he sat motionless, and there came a relaxation of the stern, expressionless face which he had turned toward the guard.\n\nThe reason for this was that the gray wall had melted away. Bright, warm sunlight streamed through the trees that stood sentinel-straight upon the slope of a small mountain; golden shafts of summer sunshine pierced deep into the clear, cold waters of a hidden lake.\n\nConvict 341 was not of those hill-born men who smother in the confinement of walls; not a man who had roamed the great outdoors, or had known happiness only in those far distant places where the air of freedom is untainted by the pursuits of man. He had been a clerical worker in a great city, where he had occupied a cell not unlike the one that was now his home.\n\nBut the siren, then, was not a signal of an attempted escape; it was a call to labor from which there was no escape. His name had meant no more to his employer than his number now meant to the warden.\n\nAnd the lake of his visioning was only a watercolor that had hung upon the office wall at Smedley &amp;amp; Sons, Importers, since his office boy days. It had been a symbol to the boy who swept out the office and ran errands. It was a symbol when the boy became the assistant bookkeeper, and it was still a symbol to the man who for twenty years was a trusted cashier.\n\nThe salary had not been great. Good enough, perhaps, for a vacation at some mountain retreat, but the man who was to become No. 341 had dreamed his dream too long. He wanted to forget the gray walls of the office, to shut out the weird taunts of the factory siren that summoned others to work and to whose summons he responded. There had grown up in him a great ambition that took complete control of his actions, his dreamings, his planning. He must own for himself the great peace and quiet of that hidden lake where the sunlight did not filter through masses of smoke, and only the imagined songs of free birds avoided the hush of complete silence.\n\nHe had saved some money when he was thirty, but an illness had used up the fund, and then he knew that he must resort to other means than saving. He invested small sums, bet at long odds at the races, risked small amounts on the Chinese lottery. But his losings about offset his winnings, and his dreams came no nearer to realization.\n\nThen he knew. He must really gamble. No more long shots. One supreme game where he would t the only treasure he possessed. His dream. If he won, it would be fulfilled. If he lost, it would be gone forever. But into this game he must put his best. There must be no ill-considered moves, no hasty action. Only care—thought—deliberation.\n\nHe was thirty-two years of age when he perfected his plans—long, careful plans that occupied all of his spare time. Even when he was in his cage, he would pause to stare into space, not at the vision of the lake, but blankly, as one who is lost in deep thought.\n\nSuddenly he evinced a new interest in the business. He studied accountancy at night and asked many questions about the conduct of the company&#39;s affairs.\n\nAt last he found it. A flaw in the system of accountancy used by the firm, a failure to carry out the proper checks to insure accuracy. If he were careful he could win through. Immediately he commenced to appropriate small sums of the money that passed through his hands.\n\nThe goal was fixed. Ten years, with each golden day contributing its mite toward the ultimate figure that was the sum of freedom. Patience, perseverance—a little luck and the game would be won.\n\nOne day Jimmy, the office boy, stood staring at the watercolor of the mountain lake. Turning to the man who was to become Convict 341, he said:\n\n&quot;Wouldn&#39;t I like to go swimming in that lake, though? Hot day like this. It would be fine, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;\n\nThat had started the only friendship No. 341 had ever known. His gray eyes looked kindly from out the sallow face, for here was someone else who also had a vision —his vision.\n\n&quot;Some day,&quot; he had said to the boy, &quot;I am going to quit working here and get me a lake like that.&quot;\n\n&quot;Say, that would be a great idea,&quot; said the boy. Then doubtfully: &quot;But that would take money—&quot;\n\n&quot;It would take money,&quot; admitted the man, but the words were not those of one who spoke of impossible hope.\n\nThe summer before he lost the game, he had given the boy ten dollars to go to a boys&#39; summer camp. It was his only charity. The boy had come back with enthusiastic tales of his wonderful week. Then the game had ended, and Convict 341 had lost his bet.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Symbol of Freedom\n\nHis first few weeks in the penitentiary had been almost unbearable. Not that he was offended by the prison fare, or the discipline, or the confinement. His life was not so different than it had formerly been, and he rather enjoyed his work on a lathe in the carpentry shop. His great agony was due to the ending of his dream. The long hours, with nothing to think about — he had lived with this one plan, this one hope, so long that there was nothing left.\n\nFor how could a man of forty-two plan what he would do when he was sixty-two, And this was his home for the next twenty years. Twenty years was a harsh sentence for his offense, but the prosecutor had made much of his breach of trust and the man who had for so long retired within himself had not known how to plead for leniency. Without friends or influence, there was small hope that the sentence would ever be shortened.\n\nThe siren sounded. Its long, sobbing, throaty blasts were blended with the shrieks of smaller sirens as the prison cars, loaded with gray-uniformed men, dashed out of the great gates and raced off in the distance.\n\nThe convict next him at the lathe whispered.\n\n&quot;God! I hope he makes it!&quot;\n\nThen they were herded to their cells, where they remained until the chase had abated and the investigation following had been completed.\n\n&quot;Who was it?&quot; he whispered cautiously to the man at the next lathe.\n\n&quot;Jack Wood.&quot;\n\n&quot;Did he make it?&quot;\n\n&quot;No; they got him. He&#39;s in the black hole.&quot;\n\nTwice that year he was first startled, then thrilled, by the wild cry of that siren. His symbolism was reversed now. The siren was the symbol of a soul&#39;s dash for freedom. It was another game, a fresh deal. If the siren would only remain silent a little longer! Just a little more time, and the escape might be successful!\n\nHe began to see against the gray wall of his cell a glorified watercolor. Once more he took up the dream of his lifetime. Perhaps it was not too late. Now it was a game against time, the game of one man against a mighty siren.\n\nWith improvised tools stolen from the work room, he spent long hours chipping, chipping, at the concrete. His progress was barely noticeable. In a year, he had made progress. In two years he could see hopes for his plan. Three years, and he was certain that he could get out of the cell. He was now held only by a shell.\n\nBut there were other obstacles. One was that he must make his way to the prison yard and then scale the wall.\n\nA train stopped at the station at eight forty-five o&#39;clock each evening. He must get over the wall, drop to the roof of this train, and be whisked away into the darkness, for the cleared country about the walls was so thoroughly lighted in all directions that it would be impossible for him to make his escape on foot.\n\nThe men were returned to their cells at six o&#39;clock. At seven-thirty and at nine they were required to stand up in front of their cots for inspection.\n\nThe seven-thirty inspection was the greatest obstacle to his plan. He could not be in his cell at that time if he were to be successful in his flight, for at that time there was a change of guards at the wall and in the yard, and he must take advantage of this circumstance so that he would not be discovered from the outside.\n\nOne night at seven-thirty, as the guard passed his cell. Convict 341 remained standing until the guard was in front of him. As the guard looked within, 341 started to sit down then straightened up. For two weeks he did this at exactly the same time.\n\nThen he did not straighten up as the guard looked at him, but sank lower toward the cot. This he kept up for another two weeks.\n\nNext he sat down just as the guard looked within. For weeks, as the guard appeared at the door. No. 341 sat down. Then he commenced sitting-down just before the guard came to the door, and finally remained seated until the guard had passed. One night there was a relief guard. Number 341 remained seated holding a newspaper before his face as he had done for several days. The new guard called him to attention. Was his careful plan going to avail him nothing?\n\nThe next night he hesitated long, debating whether to stand or to remain seated on the chance that his old guard was back. He was in a terror of apprehension as the steps of the sentry approached. He was tense as he remained seated with a newspaper before his face. If it were the new guard, he would be reported and forced to stand, perhaps to abandon his entire plan. Four years of work to vanish in despair.\n\nBut the guard passed by.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Symbol Of Slavery\n\nThe time for his escape was at hand. It was winter, for he had chosen the short days in order that darkness might conceal him, once he was out of that circle of light about the buildings. If he were observed by a guard and the train stopped, he would be able to slip off the train and have a chance of winning free.\n\nConvict 341 had no friends outside of the walls who were enough interested in him to write him even an occasional letter. During the entire period of his incarceration, he had never received any communication from the world outside. When one evening, Guard Conroy was handed a postcard for 341, he was interested. This was unusual.\n\nBeing curious, he examined it. It was a picture of a mountain lake with a hillside of tall trees. The writing was a boyish scrawl.\n\nYou will be glad to hear I am living at a lake just like the picture. I ran away and bummed it here and got a job with a rancher. He owns the lake. Wish you were here. It sure Is great for swimming aud everything.\n\nYour friend,\n\nJimmy.\n\nGuard Conroy walked down the corridor and tossed the card through the bars. &quot;Letter for you!&quot; he called, as he passed on. The figure on the bed was interested in the newspaper held before his face. There was no response. A few minutes later. Guard Conroy made the seven-thirty inspection. As usual, 341 did not stand up, but as the guard passed by, he saw that the postcard still lay on the floor. He wondered at the convict&#39;s indifference to the first piece of mail he had ever received.\n\n&quot;Hey, there!&quot; he called. &quot;Why don&#39;t you read that postcard?&quot;\n\nThere was no response.\n\nGuard Conroy went on with the inspection, and as he went, he kept turning over in his mind the refusal of 341 to read the card. So he walked back to the cell.\n\n&quot;Stand up, 3411&quot; he ordered.\n\nNo. 341 remained seated on his cot.\n\n&quot;Come, now, snap out of it!&quot; commanded the guard in a louder voice.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nSure, now, that something was wrong, he unlocked the steel door and entered the cell, and pulled away the newspaper.\n\nA dummy sat on the cot and 341 was gone.\n\nThe siren screamed again. The guards rushed from their quarters. Cars sprang from garages and through the gateways, as the massive gates swung open. The hunt was on.\n\nThe inmates were lined up at the doors of their cells, and a check was made to see if any others were missing.\n\nThe prison yard was searched, and under a box that had contained new machinery for the shop. Convict 341 was found. The siren had beaten him. It was, after all, the symbol of slavery.\n\nAnd the siren had held as a trump in that game of time a card with the picture of a mountain lake, bearing a kindly message from the only friend Convict No. 341 had in all the world!\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

The moonlight had faded from the lake. Out to the south, over the line of wooded hills, summer storm clouds had risen to obscure the moon and make the placid lake surface a dim expanse of purple. Now as Barrington rounded the point, the lights of the summer hotel in the cove beyond the cottage where he lived with Bruce Arton, were vaguely visible through the trees. It was nearly midnight and there were only a few lights. Some of them winked out as Barrington stared at them. He was following the shore now. In a moment the lights were obscured. No one would notice the tiny blob of his canoe, merging with the shadows of the shoreline.\n\nIt occured to Barrington as a thing very strange that he should care whether or not anyone saw him returning home from the dance at Woodhaven across the lake. George Barrington liked dancing. He was fond of all the lighter, gay things of life. At twenty-seven now he was a tall, dark, sleek and handsome fellow.\n\nAlways well dressed, perfectly groomed. His manner was suave, sophisticated; his personality charming, especially to women. He knew all that, but it didn&#39;t make him conceited. From a business point of view, he had to be personable. His looks, his manner, his soft cultivated voice were all part of his stock in trade.\n\nBecause some day George Barrington would be recognized as one of the country&#39;s great actors. Recognition had been a little slow coming — but it would come. Underneath his light gayety, there was the real Barrington; a cool, calm, perhaps ruthless sort of fellow who knew what he wanted, and was determined to have it. You had to be that way, or life would side-track you … .\n\nNow he was tense, and he hoped that his canoe wouldn&#39;t be seen. More than that, he was making sure that it wouldn&#39;t be seen. He tried to tell himself that there would be no trouble with his cousin, Bruce Arton. He had determined to have the showdown now, tonight — because he and Arton would be alone tonight; and tomorrow Arton&#39;s fiance was coming and the housekeeper would be back and there would be other friends in, the next day. After tonight it would be too late. Too late for what? Barrington didn&#39;t face the question. He set his handsome mouth more grimly, put more power into his strokes of the paddle, as though suddenly there was a tense urgency in what lay ahead.\n\nThe lake darkened. Overhead the clouds were spreading. Now there was only one light visible at the ragged, wooded shoreline — the light in Arton&#39;s cottage, one of his windows of the chemical laboratory where he was undoubtedly working.\n\nBarrington silently swept his frail little craft up to the small dock; he pulled the canoe up on the incline and put on his jacket. Quietly he ascended the little trail that led up through the trees and along the edge of a ragged gully, from the dock to the house.\n\nThe Death Trail. The name, from a hundred years ago, still clung to it — this little trail that led from the lake up into the hills where once an Indian brave had met his young betrothed here in the summer moonlight and killed her and then himself. Barrington knew little of the legendary story and cared less. But he thought of the name now as he followed the trail up to Arton&#39;s cottage. He thought of it with a queer, vague feeling like a shudder.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Real Secret Of Ductility\n\nArton had built a south wing on the house last summer, equipped it as his private laboratory so that he could continue his experiments in research chemistry during the months he was up here from the city. Barrington entered through the little side door. He closed it after him.\n\n&quot;Oh, you George?&#39;&#39; Arton greeted. &quot;You&#39;re back early. Have a nice time?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, thanks.&quot;\n\nBarrington sat down on a little stool, here by the door, midway of the room. It was a narrow, oblong room, with bench tables and shelves littered with bottles and what to Barrington was a meaningless maze of chemical apparatus. The place glowed with dim eerie light; it was redolent with queer smells. A place of mystery. Interesting maybe, if you liked that sort of thing. Barrington didn&#39;t. The realm of chemistry was worse than Greek to him, a thing for the fussy type of mind like Arton&#39;s.\n\nCertainly no two men could have been more wholly different than the handsome, fun-loving, suave George Barrington and his older cousin. Arton who was busily at work now. He was standing in the narrow glare of a hooded light at a table across the room.\n\nThe steady droning hum of an electric motor came from there. Two tiny spindles a few feet apart were whirring, with a big metal arm very slowly oscillating between them. Arton, in his shirt sleeves and baggy trousers, with his thin sandy hair rumpled, had turned briefly to greet Barrington; now he was back, intent on his work. Bruce Arton was thirty-five — a smallish, slim, wirey fellow with a grave and solemnly intellectual face. He was in business for himself, what he called a research chemist with several big manufacturing concerns for his clients.\n\n&quot;You look busy,&quot; Barrington said into the moment of silence.\n\nArton turned around again. He certainly seemed in a good mood; there was an air of quiet triumph about him.\n\n&quot;I solved it,&quot; Arton said, &quot;and by Jove I believe it&#39;s the most important thing I&#39;ve ever done in my life.&quot;\n\nHe added something about the great Bell Telephone Company, and what his client, some National Wire Company, would have to say to them when this new Arton Process was patented. A lot of Greek to Barrington. He hardly listened to it; he was thinking of Marjorie. He had telephoned down to the city tonight, but hadn&#39;t gotten her.\n\n&quot;Oh,&quot; Barrington said. &quot;Well, that&#39;s fine, Bruce.&quot;\n\nIt sounded as though there might be a lot of money in it for Arton. Good enough. The prospect of that would have him in a receptive frame of mind. Now was the time to cinch the thing.\n\n&quot;Fine?&quot; Arton echoed. &quot;Yes, I&#39;m very gratified, of course. I&#39;ve certainly worked hard enough on it this summer.&quot; The electric hum had suddenly stopped. The little spindles were motionless. Arton looked at a dial, nodded to himself and smiled. He was full of quiet enthusiasm, just in the right mood.\n\n&quot;You&#39;d say I&#39;ve just discovered the real secret of ductility,&#39;&#39; he added. &quot;The ability to draw metal out, into an infinitely fine wire. I&#39;ve got it, George. A more perfect ductility than has ever been achieved before. A gossamer metallic thread, yet so strong you couldn&#39;t snap it with your fingers. Can you imagine how nice that will be for the intricacies of telephone switchboards? For — &#39;&#39; &quot;Sure, that&#39;s grand,&quot; Barrington said abstractedly. How was the best way to broach the thing? Arton had been stalling these past weeks, of course.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Damn Little Double-Crosser\n\nArton now had one of the tiny spindles in his hand. He was saying, &quot;A metallic alloy, quite the usual thing, and then I added a totally new compound. And that did it! You&#39;d never believe — &quot;\n\nBarrington managed a grin. &quot;I sure wouldn&#39;t, whatever it is. Bruce, listen — &quot;\n\n&quot;I could put thousands of yards of it in a thimble,&quot; Arton went on. &quot;And it&#39;s so strong — I&#39;ve just been measuring its length and strength. You — &quot;\n\n&quot;Bruce listen, that little matter we were discussing — &quot;\n\n&quot;Eh? Oh, what&#39;s that, George?&quot;\n\nBarrington tensed. The thing suddenly seemed more important to him than ever before. A turning point in his life, with his future stretching ahead — a future that could be drab, full of frustrations like his past; or flushed with victory, expanding like a snowball, rolling up into the success of fame and riches.\n\n&quot;My new show, Bruce,&quot; Barrington was saying. &quot;You can&#39;t lose backing it, there&#39;s no possible way.&quot;\n\nThe enthusiasm faded out of Arton&#39;s thin, studious face. &quot;Oh, that again.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, that again.&quot; Barrington tried to talk quietly. &quot;We&#39;ve been all over it, and I had you convinced — &quot;\n\n&quot;Did you?&quot;\n\n&quot;To be frank, Bruce, we need the first five thousand, well, tomorrow. And another in a month should see us through. You said — you see, we&#39;ve been relying on — &quot;\n\n&quot;Have you?&quot; Arton&#39;s thin lips went grim. He was getting angry — a queer fellow, like a little chimney, to be heated in a moment.\n\n&quot;I never said a damn thing, just listened to you talk,&quot; Arton said. &quot;And now I realize you didn&#39;t give it to me straight, George. Crooked, like all your thinking, like everything you do as a matter of fact. You didn&#39;t tell me about this Marjorie LaMotte — is that what she calls herself?&quot;\n\nMarjorie! How in the devil did he know about —\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve heard of her, naturally,&quot; Arton was saying. &quot;She was doing fine in burlesque until the Mayor closed down all that sort of stuff. So now you want me to angel a show that&#39;s going to put my cousin over as a great actor! Some day you&#39;ll be another E. H. Southern or like Maurice Evans, maybe? That&#39;s what you tell me! So I&#39;m supposed to risk ten or fifteen thousand in a honky-tonk for you and this LaMotte woman! Don&#39;t make me laugh!&quot;\n\nIt wasn&#39;t going to work … ! Arton had never any idea of helping, just a damn little double-crosser … . The thoughts, with no process of thinking back of them, stabbed at George Barrington. Arton was engaged to marry a damn snobbish society girl. He&#39;d discussed the thing with her, of course. And she&#39;d queered it! She&#39;d queer everything, once he married her — for instance, the present arrangement of Arton&#39;s staking his cousin to three thousand a year allowance until he got started in business. And any chance at big money —\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nProphetic Words\n\nBarrington was on his feet. Arton was angry and sarcastic. Well, two could play at that! &quot;I don&#39;t like to hear that kind of stuff,&quot; Barrington heard himself saying. &quot;When you talk about Marjorie LaMotte — anyway, how did you — &quot;\n\n&quot;She phoned me today,&quot; Arton snapped back. &quot;You told her everything was fixed, I suppose? And when she found it wasn&#39;t — &quot;\n\nArton smiled wryly.\n\n&quot;She — what you&#39;d call turned the heat on a little. You&#39;re my cousin, see? And I&#39;m going to be married, get the idea? You&#39;re my closest relative — I wouldn&#39;t want any scandal. Seems it isn&#39;t all just business between you and LaMotte, George. And if you don&#39;t come across now, she&#39;s liable to turn on you, and on me!&quot;\n\nWhat a fool thing for Marjorie to do, jumping in like this! Barrington stood speechless. He was across the room now, leaning against a work table a few feet from Arton.\n\nHe gasped, &quot;Marjorie didn&#39;t mean — &quot;\n\n&quot;Oh yes she did!&quot; Arton retorted. &quot;A refined sort of blackmail. That&#39;s what you&#39;d call it! My closest relative, well thank Heaven you&#39;re no closer than a cousin. I had a talk with Alice about it last night. We&#39;re going to wash our hands of you, George. You go right ahead — &quot;\n\n&quot;Why you — you rotten — &quot;\n\n&quot;Sure! And now you&#39;re showing your true colors, aren&#39;t you? Alice warned me! You go ahead, George — do your worst — &quot;\n\nProphetic words! Arton couldn&#39;t guess. It was only a vague blurred thought in the tumult of Barrington&#39;s mind. He was beyond reason, with the eerie laboratory room swaying before him and his right hand reaching for a little globular object on the table beside him. Then Barrington&#39;s cold fingers closed over it — a heavy retort, like a jug. Barrington hardly knew that he had flung it. Then he saw it strike Arton on the side of the head, and as it crashed to the floor Arton was tottering on his feet.\n\nBut he wasn&#39;t dead. He screamed when Barrington leaped upon him. It was a horrible, piercing scream. It filled the laboratory room. It surged out the open window, echoed out through the trees into the darkness of the sullen night … .\n\nShut him up! You&#39;ve got to shut him up! Silence him now forever! Barrington&#39;s thought blurred. Everything seemed dim and far away. But he knew that his fingers were gripping Arton&#39;s throat, his fingers strangling so that the scream died … .\n\nBarrington panted through an eternity, holding his grip tighter, with the lunging body under him, the flailing arms and legs gradually weakening; until at last the crumpled thing which had been Bruce Arton lay motionless.\n\nBarrington jumped to his feet. That scream still seemed echoing, though it was long since a memory. Somebody would have heard it! Somebodv might be coming from the nearby hotel across the wooded promontory! Worse than that! They were coming already! The terrified Barrington could hear them — the shouts of men out on the shortcut path down the hill!\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nHis Ace In The Hole\n\nIn that instant, Barrington had only the wits to snatch up the retort and wipe it off. Then he turned and ran, ducking out the side door the way he had entered. Now the laboratory wing was between him and the path down to the hotel. It shielded him; and then the darkness enveloped him as he fled down the trail, under the trees to the lake. Barrington was winded, breathless and covered with sweat as he crouched in the darkness of the little dock with his canoe on the incline beside him.\n\nThe shouts were up by the laboratory now. Then in the night silence he could hear that the men had discovered Arton&#39;s body … . Barrington fought for calmness. After all, he was in no danger. No one had seen him arrive from Woodhaven in the canoe. He could take it now and paddle away. No! He would be seen, out there on the lake. But suppose he had just arrived now? He would have heard the scream, just as the other men did, down at the hotel. He&#39;d hear it, and he&#39;d shout and run up to the house, just as they had!\n\nEverything was all right! Queerly a sort of calm triumph began enveloping Barrington. His heritage from Arton was ten or fifteen thousand at the least; Arton had been making a lot of money lately.\n\nBarrington realized that subconsciously he had been thinking of that all evening. His ace in the hole. It had been in his mind when he wanted not to be seen arriving. Money to put over the show and fix things up with Marjorie. And that chemical invention of Arton&#39;s — there would be his notes on it, of course. Barrington could get them, hold them dark for a couple of years, and then tackle those big companies himself. Maybe there&#39;d be a fortune in it for him. What luck!\n\nBarrington stood up on the dock. And then he saw that the time had come for him to shout his arrival. Two or three of the men suddenly appeared up on the trail. Their voices floated down. And then Barrington shouted back, ran up the trail a few feet, stopped and called … . It was so simple! Breathless, confused exchanges.\n\n&quot;I was just paddling up to the dock!&quot; Barrington was shouting. &quot;Heard somebody screaming! What is it? What happened!&quot;\n\n&quot;Bruce Arton! He&#39;s dead — &quot;\n\n&quot;Dead! Bruce dead — &quot;\n\n&quot;Somebody got in there and killed him!&quot;\n\nThese men were four or five of the hotel guests. Barrington knew some of them. He met them a little way up the trail, where Barrington had stopped and was standing speechless, breathless, shocked by the news.\n\n&quot;Why — why that&#39;s horrible — !&quot; he gasped. &quot;I thought it was his voice screaming — I paddled hard as I could — then I heard you people — &quot;\n\nOverhead pallid moonlight was straggling down through the rifted clouds now. It struck on the frightened faces of the men, and on the trees and on the naked rocks here along the gully brink.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA Tiny Thread Of Wire\n\nAnd now here was big Johnson, the hotel detective. He was coming down the trail with one of the men. But they weren&#39;t walking or running. They came slowly, bending down, and Johnson was holding his flashlight.\n\n&quot;Where the devil you suppose it goes?&quot; the man with Johnson muttered.\n\n&quot;Here it still is,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;Quicker if we lift it up.&quot;\n\nLift what up? What the devil was this?\n\n&quot;Oh, hello Barrington,&quot; the hotel detective said. The man with him muttered something, and Johnson turned. &quot;Shut up! Maybe so. We&#39;ll soon see, come on, keep going.&quot;\n\nBarrington and the men with him blankly stared as the detective and his companion went past them. Slowly they went down to the dock and then began coming back.\n\n&quot;Well I&#39;m damned!&quot; the man said. &quot;It&#39;s him — &quot;\n\n&quot;Shut up! Make sure!&quot;\n\nCold with puzzled apprehension, Barrington stood silent. And now he saw that the stooping detective was holding his light to follow something that lay along the ground.\n\nThen Johnson pounced. &quot;There&#39;s the end of it! Take a look everybody! Got him like we found him chained to the corpse!&quot; He was gripping Barrington now, pointing. &quot;Here is the killer, we got him!&quot;\n\nBarrington&#39;s mind swept back … . Arton in the laboratory, binding his new gossamer wire from one spindle to another, measuring its length and its strength.. Then Arton with one of the tiny spindles, much smaller than a thimble, in his hand … . And then Arton down on the floor, hands flailing as Barrington crouched over him … .\n\nNow Barrington saw the tiny spindle with the gleaming gossamer thread trailing from it, where it had caught in one of the big ornate leather buttons of his summer sport jacket! It was the empty spindle; and its tiny thread of wire stretched from here back to the laboratory where the other spindle had been unwinding as Barrington ran!\n\nLike a death trail — damnable little gossamer that you couldn&#39;t break, connecting this murderer with his victim!\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Have you contemplated using the typewriter to frame a Black Hand epistle?\n\nIf so, just bear in mind while spreading the rhetorical poison or attempting to levy blackmail that the chances are the letters will be immediately traced to your pen, and even more swiftly if they are typed.\n\nThis is the admonition of James T. Cortelyou, former chief of postal inspectors, recently appointed chief of the Philadelphia District Attorney&#39;s staff of detectives.\n\nFrequently the sender of an anonymous letter will use a typewriter in the belief that his handwriting, even if disguised, might provide a clue, but that it would be impossible to trace the typed epistle.\n\nNothing could be more in error. When you use a typewriter for an unlawful letter you might as well sign it with your own thumbprint, because of all the typewriters in use throughout the entire world, no two, Cortelyou points out, write exactly alike. A typewritten line to the trailer of the poison pen and blackhand letter, such as the postal inspector, is regarded as much an identifying clue as the fingerprints left upon a safe which has just been blown open.\n\nFirst, the letter goes under a powerful magnifying glass to determine what make of machine was used, and then the class number is ascertained. Now comes the process of elimination after the recipient of the letter has provided a lengthy list of all persons who might feel unfriendly toward him.\n\nGradually the list narrows down, and then among the suspects it is learned which have had access to such a typewriter as was used. Sounds easy, doesn&#39;t it? But first you must qualify as a typewriting expert and rank in the same class as the highly-paid handwriting expert before your testimony would be acceptable.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nAn Interesting Case\n\nOne of the most interesting cases in the Cortelyou records is that of the Black Hand letters which for 17 months completely baffled a corps of inspectors. It has for its finale the arrest in a woodland shack near Coryopolis, Pennsylvania, of a pretty girl thrill-hunter who had been the author of the poison-pen and blackmail letters simply because she gained a &quot;kick&quot; out of being ht.\n\n&quot;In this case,&quot; said Cortelyou, &quot;wealthy residents of Coryopolis were in constant receipt of letters demanding amounts which varied front $5,000 to $50,000. The letters were typewritten and in each one the recipient was instructed to display willingness to meet the demands by inserting in the personal column of a Pittsburgh newspaper a cipher message contained in the letter.\n\n&quot;For seventeen months this continued. The cipher replies were inserted in the newspaper, but no further move was made. Then I went to Coryopolis to direct the search for the mysterious writer, and was convinced that I was up against the toughest case of my career.\n\n&quot;My check-up showed there was no typewriter in Coryopolis upon which the letters were written, unless it was well concealed. The check-up then extended to those who commuted to a larger town and who would have access to typewriters there.\n\n&quot;While awaiting developments my attention had been attracted at the railway station by a pretty bobbed hair girl of the flapper type who made the daily trip to the larger town, chatting and laughing with her fellow passengers and appearing to be a general favorite and confidant of girls of her own age and station, who had occasion later to regret having revealed indiscretions to this sympathetic listener.\n\n&quot;My attention became more closely drawn when I noticed that on two evenings each week, instead of alighting from the returning train on the station platform, she jumped down from the opposite side of the coach, forcing her way through brush and over rubbish heaps, and vanishing into a strip of deep woods.\n\n&quot;In the meantime we had been sending some fictitious query to every concern in the other town where a Coryopolis commuter was employed and the replies were coming in typewritten form as we had sought.\n\n&quot;Looking over a batch of these replies, I saw before me the imprint of the same type keys which had struck out the blackmail letters. It was a concern specializing in the collection of bad debts, and three hours later I had learned that the flapper, into whose small pink ears other girls loved to pour their secrets, was employed there as a typist.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nJazz-Aged Thrill-Hunters\n\nThat night I had my men planted in the woods into which the girl was accustomed to make her way. I also was under cover near the railroad tracks.\n\n&quot;Sure enough, as the train came to a stop, the girl, clad in a collegiate sweater and white sneakers, swung down from the platform. Carrying a tennis racket and a number of packages, she made her way over the old route.\n\n&quot;Finally, in a clearing which might easily have been hidden from our view even though we&#39;d been searching for it, we saw the shack and a great hulk of a youth in soiled flannels lounging on a bench before it.\n\n&quot;Making certain that my men had surrounded the place, I stepped forward and asked if I might have a bucket of water for the dry radiator of my car which had stalled on a back road near here.\n\n&quot;&#39;He&#39;s a spy, Joe,&#39; shrilled the girl. &#39;Knock him off!&#39;\n\n&quot;With a shouted curse, the youth—her brother, I later learned—made a grab for an automatic pistol on the window sill, while the girl tried to reach a pump gun standing in a corner. My men were too quick for them, however.\n\n&quot;The girl did succeed in breaking loose for an instant after she had sunk her teeth into the wrist of an inspector, and attempted to destroy some slips of paper which we found were different codes which had been used in the letters. We also found another typewriter, a quantity of stationery which had been used for those baffling letters and lengthy memorandum as to the confidences girl friends had been pouring into her ready ear on the commuters&#39; train.\n\n&quot;The brother, a fugitive because of a series of robberies in which he had sought thrills rather than plunder, and his sister admitted they had planned a series of blackmail and poisonous letters which would have ruined the lives of the foolish flappers who had confessed indiscretions and might have driven one or two brides to suicide.\n\n&quot;Here was an example in which two jazz-age victims, jaded from normal pursuits, had gone forth as thrill-hunters. They confessed they found thrills in seeing the code messages appear in the newspaper personal column in swift reply to their demands.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

It was a horrible night, and the mean streets through which the officer was patrolling were completely deserted.\n\nEven the inevitable down-and-outs had vanished. Probably those unfortunate people were crouching in doorways for shelter. Simpson&#39;s powerful bull&#39;s-eye only made a blur in a fog, and he switched the light off as he started down Canal Street to the end of his beat.\n\nSomething flashed by him with a terrified squawk. It was a cat, tail stiff and fur bristling. Only for a moment did the constable see it, and then the animal was swallowed up by the fog.\n\n&quot;Wonder what scared it?&quot; Simpson mused.\n\nAs if in answer a scream echoed down the street. Never had the constable heard such a frightful sound. He felt his blood run cold, and for several moments was unable to move. Then he began to run as the scream broke on a high note and died away in a rattling gurgle.\n\nThe fog made it difficult for him to locate the direction from which the cry had come. He ran the length of the long street, and turned into Potter&#39;s Lane, shouting as he went along. His own voice was thrown back to him in a muffled echo, but the scream was not repeated.\n\nIn the neighbourhood doors were opened, and harsh Cockney voices demanded to know what was the matter. Simpson turned back. The cry must have come from higher up the street.\n\nAs he went along Simpson, heard a slight squeaking mingled with the sound of somebody breathing hard. A trolley, made out of a shallow box and fitted with bicycle wheels, rolled out of the darkness. On the trolley a man squatted. He was propelling the vehicle by moving the wheels with his hands, and from the open front of the box projected a pair of wooden legs.\n\nSimpson recognised a character of the neighbourhood, a beggar who was known as Peg-Leg. He was often to be seen rolling himself through the streets on his homemade trolley. A placard on his hack stated that he had lost his legs in the war, and the tin cup he held up to passers-by was always well filled.\n\nPeg-Leg carried a handful of shoe laces and a few boxes of matches as a pretence that he was a hawker and not a beggar. He rolled his big bead back and looked up at the constable with frightened eyes.\n\n&quot;Did you &#39;ear that?&quot; he gasped.\n\n&quot;I did,&quot; snapped Simpson. &quot;Who yelled?&quot;\n\n&quot;Dunno. Seemed to come from about &#39;arf way down the street.&quot;\n\nHe turned the trolley with his powerful hands, and followed the officer. They reached an alleyway which cut off at right angles from the street. It was a cul-de-sac which led to the yard of a bottle works. Simpson went down it a little way, but could see nothing.\n\nA hoarse cry from Peg-Leg brought him running back to the head of the alley. It had started to rain, and the fog had been driven away. There was sufficient light to make out a huddled shape which sprawled over the sill of a window over twenty feet from the ground.\n\nSimpson turned his bull&#39;s-eye on the object. The light picked up the yellow face of an old man who was hanging half out of the window. His mouth was slightly open, and his eyes bulged. Simpson shuddered as he snapped out the light.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s Levy, the pawnbroker!&quot; Peg-Leg said in an awed voice. &quot;What&#39;s the matter with him, guv&#39;nor?&quot;\n\n&quot;None of your business!&quot; Simpson snapped. &quot;Get away home just now. You&#39;ll probably have to answer a few questions later.&#39;&#39;\n\nWith a surly grunt, Peg-Leg wheeled himself off.\n\nSimpson blew a shrill blast on his whistle; and then hurried round the angle of the block to the front door of the pawnshop. There was no answer to his hammerings. He knew that the old pawnbroker lived alone up there, and promptly put his sturdy shoulders to the door. The flimsy lock snapped, and the constable stumbled into the shop.\n\nPushing his way by the racks of old clothes and similar pledges, he mounted a winding flight of stairs which led to the room where Levy slept. The old house was three storeyed, and the uncarpeted stairs creaked as the officer hurried up.\n\nHe tried two rooms on the top floor, but they were used for storage. When he tried a third door on the landing he found it locked. Flashing his light into the keyhole, he could see the key on the other side.\n\nHe tried to force the door. It was much stronger than the one on the street, however, and it took several charges to send it crashing inwards. Simpson rushed in and crossed to the figure that sprawled over the window-sill.\n\nOne glance was sufficient to tell him that the old pawnbroker was dead. There were ugly bruises on his scrawny throat, his lips were blue, and his tongue was swollen. He had been strangled.\n\nThe room itself showed plenty of signs that the dead man had struggled valiantly. A table was overturned, and even the black-out curtains had been torn down. A cash-box lay on the floor, wads of notes scattered in all directions. The killer had been scared away before he could complete the robbery he had attempted.\n\nThe thing that puzzled Simpson, however, was how the criminal could have entered the room and left it.\n\nThe door had been locked on the inside, there was no hiding-place, and the only exit was by the window. A wall of smooth red brick went down for twenty feet into the alley, and there was no drain-pipe or anything else by which the man could have climbed.\n\nConstable Simpson almost stopped breathing. He turned off the light, and with his powerful flashlamp began to look carefully over the floor. He gave an exclamation when he found strange marks close to the window. They were the marks of claws, exactly like those of some gigantic bird.\n\n&quot;The Bird Burglar!&quot; gasped Simpson. &quot;A killing this time, too. I&#39;ve got to telephone Scotland Yard. Those fellows are in charge of this case.&quot;\n\nHe closed the broken window as best he could, and then hurried down to the shop, where there was a telephone.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nHawke Takes Charge\n\nThe Bird Burglaries, as they were called by the newspapers, had started about a month before. They were sensational, because the criminal always entered by a window far above the ground, and there were never any traces to show how he had climbed up.\n\nIn every case the claw marks of a giant bird had been found on the scene of the robbery. There were no footmarks and no finger-prints. The crimes were carried out swiftly and silently, sometimes while the victim was peacefully asleep in the same room.\n\nThe police had been completely baffled, and finally Scotland Yard authorities had been called in. Equally as puzzled as the police, they had at last put the case in the hands of Dixon Hawke, the famous criminologist.\n\nHawke had checked the alarming number of robberies by suggesting that people with valuables should keep their upstairs windows as securely closed as those on the ground floor. For over a week after the suggestion had been made public the Bird Burglar had been quiet.\n\nThe murder of Levy was likely to cause a panic. Nobody was safe from a criminal who seemed capable of flying twenty feet into the air.\n\nWithin one hour of Simpson discovering the crime, Dixon Hawke was on the scene, together with his assistant, Tommy Burke, and several of the Yard officials. A police doctor had just finished examining the body.\n\n&quot;Strangled all right,&quot; he said. &quot;The murderer had very powerful hands, too. I have rarely seen such marks made by human fingers.&quot;\n\n&quot;Any finger-prints, doctor?&quot; Hawke asked.\n\n&quot;None. He wore gloves.&quot;\n\nHawke nodded. The Bird Burglar had always worn gloves. The only telltale marks he left on the scene of his crimes were these giant claw-marks. In this instance they were clear and sharp, and made a deep dent in the worn carpet near the window. The raider was of heavy build.\n\nLooking round the room, the criminologist noticed the remains of a fish supper on a side table. He judged that the dead pawnbroker had prepared his meal and opened the window to let out the smell of the cooking. Forgetful of the open window, and the black-out, he had sat down to go over his accounts.\n\nLevy was something of a miser. He did not trust banks, and kept a large sum of money in his rooms. There was a safe of the very latest design in one corner.\n\n&quot;He was asking for trouble to keep so much money here, chief,&quot; Tommy Burke said. &quot;Gosh! No wonder the Bird Burglar paid him a visit!&quot;\n\n&quot;I wonder how he knew Levy had so much money here?&quot; Hawke mused. &quot;H&#39;m! It seems to me the killer knew this district very well, and waited a long time for that window to be left open.&quot;\n\nHe went to the window as he spoke and began to examine the sill with the aid of a powerful flash. The freestone was covered with a layer of soot and grime from the factories in the neighbourhood.\n\nIt was possible to make out the smudgy marks of Levy&#39;s body. The killer had apparently carried his victim to the window with the intention of throwing him out, but had abandoned that idea when the shouts of Constable Simpson alarmed him.\n\nLooking further along the stone ledge, Hawke found two sets of broad marks, four in each. They had been made by the gloved hands of the raider hooking over the ledge to haul himself into the room.\n\n&quot;And twenty feet to the ground,&quot; Hawke said. &quot;How could he jump so far? And he either jumped or flew to reach this window.&quot;\n\nThey left the room and went down to the alley. After searching round, Hawke found the claw-marks of the Bird Burglar&#39;s feet deeply imprinted in mud. A few yards away he found another set, and then close to the first marks some further ones. It was just as if the amazing criminal had been hopping round bird fashion.\n\nThe marks grew fainter and fainter, however, and the last set Hawke found were just a blur. His keen eyes noticed something else, a double track on the greasy road made by the worn tyres of bicycle wheels.\n\n&quot;Were there any cyclists round here, Simpson?&quot; Hawke asked the constable, who was standing near.\n\nSimpson shook his head.\n\n&quot;No, sir. What you&#39;re looking at are the tracks of Peg-Leg&#39;s trolley.&quot;\n\n&quot;Peg-Leg?&quot;\n\n&quot;Something of a character, sir. He&#39;s a beggar with wooden legs. He saw Levy before I did. I sent him home, and told him he might be questioned later.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good,&quot; said Hawke. &quot;Still, it&#39;s a bad night for a beggar to be out,&quot; he added thoughtfully.\n\n&quot;Oh, he often prowls round, sir. Really amazing the way he handles that sugar-box trolley of his.&quot;\n\n&quot;Was he the only person you saw on your beat? Nothing else happened before you heard the scream?&quot;\n\nSimpson fingered the strap of his helmet thoughtfully. He was a man of keen intelligence, and carefully reviewed every detail of what had happened before the cry of the dying man echoed through the street.\n\n&quot;Well, there was a cat,&quot; he began.\n\n&quot;A cat?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes. sir. It ran past me through the fog, squawking with fright and its hair bristling. It takes a lot to scare an alley cat. I suppose the Bird Burglar must have frightened it.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s possible,&quot; Hawke agreed. &quot;The cat probably smelt Levy&#39;s fish supper, and was prowling in the alley. Humph! So our flying criminal must have reached the window from the alley. Apparently he does not fly until he reaches the scene of his crime—if he does fly.&quot;\n\nTommy Burke looked at his chief swiftly. There was a lot of meaning in the criminologist&#39;s last words.\n\n&quot;If he doesn&#39;t fly he must jump,&quot; Tommy reminded him.\n\n&quot;I think it is more likely that he does jump,&quot; Hawke replied. &quot; Well, we&#39;d better complete Our investigations by interviewing Peg-Leg. If he was near Levy&#39;s place at the time, perhaps he can give us some help. Where does he lodge, constable?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll show you, sir.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nTommy&#39;s Orders\n\nThey tramped through the mean streets, finally reaching a mews which had given stabling to many horses in the old coaching days. Some of the stalls were now used to garage the lorries of a nearby factory, and some of the others had been made into rooms. The district was dirty and ugly.\n\n&quot;They&#39;ve condemned these places for dwellings,&quot; Simpson said, &quot;but there are one or two people hanging on still. We&#39;ll find Peg-Leg here, sir.&quot;\n\nHe pointed to an iron-barred window at the end of the mews. When he banged on the door and called out who he was, a surly voice answered. Then there was the squeak of wheels, and the door was opened.\n\nPeg-Leg still squatted in his trolley, but he had removed his wooden legs, and the folded ends of his trousers flapped over his stumps. Gripping the wheels of his trolley, he turned the little vehicle with amazing skill, backing into the room so that the visitors could enter.\n\nIt was certainly a terrible hovel to be the home of a cripple man.\n\nA mattress and a few ragged blankets formed the bed. They were indescribably dirty. In another corner of the room was a rusty Primus stove and a few cooking pots. The only other furniture was a rough bench, built about knee-high, on which were various tools, and several toys made out of wood.\n\n&quot;My bloomin&#39; &#39;appy &#39;ome!&quot; Peg-Leg snarled. &quot;&#39;Ow would you like to live here, mister?&quot;\n\nThe remark was addressed to Hawke. The criminologist finished looking round, and then met the angry stare of the cripple.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he said gravely.\n\n&quot;You&#39;d be more sorry if you tried to get round on wooden pegs and sell kid&#39;s toys for a living.&quot;\n\n&quot;Haven&#39;t you ever been given artificial legs?&quot; Hawke demanded. &quot;With your war service you&#39;re entitled to them. You could walk then. I&#39;ll see what I can do for you.&quot;\n\nPeg-Leg sat bolt upright on his trolley. There was a queer look in his eyes. He put a hand on the end of the wooden stumps which were in the trolley by his side.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t want any of those things!&quot; he shouted. &quot;I much prefer the legs I made myself.&quot;\n\nThere was no trace of Cockney in his voice, but suddenly he slipped back into the harsh and whining dialect.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t trust no bloomin&#39; thing I ain&#39;t made,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;Whatcher want to see me for, mister? A &#39;tec, ain&#39;t yer? Well, I don&#39;t know nuffin&#39; about the croaking of Levy.&quot;\n\n&quot;The constable tells me that you were with him when the body was discovered.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yus, I saw it first. He was &#39;anging head downwards out of the window.&quot;\n\n&quot;What were you doing out at that hour of the night?&quot; Peg-Leg scowled. He hesitated before he answered the question, but then he went on with his old confidence.\n\n&quot;The wet made me stumps ache,&quot; he said. &quot;I couldn&#39;t stop it, so I went out. I like going around at night. People don&#39;t look at a bloke so much then.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where were you when Levy screamed?&quot;\n\n&quot;Sheltering in the archway of Pump Court from the rain.&quot;\n\n&quot;Didn&#39;t you see or hear anything?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, yes and no, mister.&quot; Peg-Leg scratched his head thoughtfully. &quot;I &#39;eard a flapping noise,&quot; he said in awed tones. &quot;Like wings it was. Then there was a scream, and then the copper shouted and ran by me. I wheeled out of me shelter and met him. Lumme, but just before that I could swear I saw something flying over the roofs!&quot;\n\n&quot;Flying?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yus, like a great bat.&quot;\n\nConstable Simpson moved uncomfortably, and even Tommy, accustomed to weird angles of crime, shot a quick look over his shoulder. Only Hawke remained unconcerned. He was even smiling as he turned away from Peg-Leg.\n\n&quot;All right,&quot; he said. &quot;Thank you for your information, Peg-Leg. I&#39;m going to have something done for you.&quot;\n\nFor answer he received a surly grunt, and hardly had the party left the room than the door was slammed and a bolt slipped into place. Peg-Leg did not like his visitors.\n\nThey walked back to Canal Street. Hawke parted from the constable with a few kindly words. Then, with Tommy, he entered the car which had brought them from Dover Street.\n\n&quot;Home, chief?&quot; the young fellow asked, slipping into place behind the wheel.\n\n&quot;Home for me, but not for you, lad,&quot; Hawke said. &quot;There&#39;s something for you to do.&quot;\n\nTommy grinned. He was glad of work, although he wondered what he could do at that stage of the case. The next words of the criminologist startled him.\n\n&quot;Get back to the mews,&quot; Hawke said, &quot;and watch Peg-Leg. I want a full report of where he goes and what he does.&quot;\n\n&quot;But he&#39;s just a beggar, chief!&quot;\n\n&quot;Perhaps, but he&#39;s not the product of the slums that he pretends to be. Although that room looked so dirty, Peg-Leg was very clean. He&#39;s never slept in that awful bed, Tommy, and he never used those greasy cooking pots. He&#39;s got some other home.&quot;\n\n&quot;Gosh!&quot;\n\n&quot;His Cockney dialect is put on, too,&quot; Hawke went on. &quot;When he got excited, he slipped up and spoke good English. He also pronounced window as window, and not a winder, as the real Cockney would do. He might just be a professional beggar who makes a good thing out of it. I want you to find out.&quot;\n\nTommy nodded. There was no job which he could do better than shadowing a suspect. It was going to be interesting to find out what mystery there was behind Peg-Leg.\n\n&quot;Telephone me at once if you find out anything,&quot; Hawke said. &quot;I&#39;ll be at Dover Street.&quot;\n\nThe car purred away in the grey light of a typical London morning, and young Burke walked back slowly towards the mews. He could watch Peg-Leg&#39;s doorway from the alleyway entrance to the court, and there was a convenient fence behind which he could hide when the man came out.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nPeg-Leg&#39;s Trail\n\nIt was nearly six o&#39;clock when the door of the hovel opened and the cripple propelled himself into the court. He paused to lock the door, and then, turning the wheels of the trolley with his strong hands, headed in Tommy&#39;s direction.\n\nAt once the young fellow slipped behind the fence. Through a crack he watched Peg-Leg pass him. The man glanced cautiously this way and that, and then trundled down Canal Street and turned into the Aldgate Road.\n\nTommy followed at a distance, his coat collar turned up, and the brim of his hat down. He knew that in the grey light and the morning drizzle he would look like some weary worker returning from a night job. He went along slowly, shuffling his feet in keeping with the part he was playing.\n\nThere was some morning traffic about, drays and carts loaded with vegetables making for the markets. Peg-Leg manoeuvred neatly until he came to a small garage near Fenchurch Station. He whirled his trolley inside.\n\nPuzzled, Tommy stopped near the garage. A cart loaded with vegetables, which had halted while the driver and his mate tightened the ropes which held their load, gave him cover. He lent the man a hand, but all the time he worked his eyes were on the garage.\n\nNearly twenty minutes passed. The carter was ready to drive away, and fumbled in his pockets for some coin to give his helper. His mouth opened when the &quot;loafer&quot; flipped out a pound note and pushed it into his hand.\n\n&quot;Keep your cart here for a bit,&quot; Tommy said quickly. &quot;I want to work on this job a bit longer.&quot;\n\n&quot;Crazy, ain&#39;t yer?&quot; gasped the carter.\n\n&quot;Well, you get a pound because I&#39;m crazy,&quot; Tommy grinned.\n\nHe ducked under the cart and pretended to tighten a rope. A two-seater was driving out of the garage, and turned slowly into the street. The driver turned his head to see if there was enough room for him to clear the cart.\n\nTommy had difficulty in pretending to be interested in nothing but his work. Although the motorist was quite well dressed and had a clipped military moustache, the keen eves of the young detective saw through the disguise. The man was Peg-Leg.\n\nHe waited until the car was on its way, and then he ducked out from under the cart and jumped for the running-board of a motor milk van which was passing. The man at the wheel shouted angrily.\n\n&quot;Keep your shirt on,&quot; Tommy said. &quot;Do you see that car ahead? Then follow it.&quot;\n\n&quot;&#39;Ere, whatcher think I am?&quot;\n\n&quot;A fellow who&#39;s going to do what he&#39;s told,&quot; young Burke snapped. &quot;I&#39;m connected with the police. There&#39;ll be a couple of pounds for you if you follow that car.&quot;\n\nThe driver licked his lips and headed after the two-seater. A couple of pounds was not much less than his weekly wage, and he was certainly not going to pass the money up. While Tommy huddled back behind the tarpaulin which protected the front seat from the rain, the van sped along directly behind Peg-Leg.\n\nThey passed through Holborn into Oxford Street. Near Hyde Park, Peg-Leg entered a quiet square, where there were some fashionable apartment buildings. Tommy ordered the van to stop, for he saw that Peg-Leg was slowing up outside one of the houses.\n\nThe man took a couple of crutches from the dickey of his car, and then neatly scrambled from his seat. He was wearing artificial limbs now, those marvels of medical science which make it possible for a cripple to move round comfortably.\n\nLimping up to the door of the building, Peg-Leg fumbled for a latchkey. A constable walked by, saluted him, and called out a cheery good morning.\n\n&quot;All right,&quot; Tommy said to the driver of the van.\n\nHe gave the man the money he had promised, and waited until he drove oft.\n\nJust then the constable came up.\n\n&quot;Wasn&#39;t that Mr. Wilson you spoke to, then?&quot; Tommy asked.\n\n&quot;No. Captain Gosling,&quot; the officer said briefly.\n\nTommy nodded and strolled away. He was bewildered by the sudden change in Peg-Leg. Certainly Hawke had been right to suspect there was some mystery about the man, but whether it was connected with the case or not was another matter.\n\nPeg-Leg might be a prince of beggars, one of those clever rascals who trade on human sympathies, and make real money out of it. The young fellow knew of several such cases.\n\nReaching a corner phone booth, he dropped in his twopence and called Dover Street. Dixon Hawke&#39;s clear voice came over the wire, and Tommy quickly told him what he had discovered.\n\n&quot;Smart work        !&quot; the criminologist said. &quot;So Peg-Leg becomes Captain Gosling, and lives in fashionable Laurel Gardens.&quot;\n\n&quot;He&#39;s just a fraud, chief.&quot;\n\nThere was a long silence at the other end. Then Hawke spoke again.\n\n&quot;Young &#39;un, I want you to wait round until Peg-Leg comes out again. This time I want you to be clumsy. Let him recognise you.&quot;\n\n&quot;But that&#39;ll scare him !&quot;\n\n&quot;I want him scared,&quot; came the brief reply. &quot;Soon as you&#39;re sure he&#39;s recognised you come back here.&quot;\n\n&quot;If that isn&#39;t the blinkin&#39; limit!&quot; Tommy gasped, hanging up the receiver. &quot; The chief&#39;s got something up his sleeve all right.&quot;\n\nHe went back to the square, and after hesitating a moment walked slowly through the place. The City was waking up, and already maids could be seen busy cleaning. Tommy leaned against the railing of the tiny park and watched the windows of the house he had seen Peg-Leg enter.\n\nThe mysterious fellow would notice him and become suspicious. Tommy knew that he hadn&#39;t long to wait.\n\nAfter some ten minutes, he was sure that the face of Captain Peg-Leg Gosling showed itself at a window on the third floor. The curtains moved as if the man was standing behind them, looking down into the square. Tommy walked slowly away, and pretended to examine the car at the kerb.\n\nSuddenly the door opened, and Peg-Leg hobbled out. He was only using one crutch now, and it was really amazing how well be walked. Tommy turned his back as the man came over to his car and began to fumble in one of the door pockets as if he was searching for something.\n\nOut of the corner of his eyes Tommy saw that the man was watching him intently. He was apparently not quite sure of his suspicions.\n\nFinally, his curiosity grew stronger than his caution. He coughed loudly to attract Tommy&#39;s attention.\n\n&quot;Hey, you!&quot;\n\nTommy turned round, making a clumsy attempt to hide his face.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; he asked.\n\n&quot;Has anybody been near my car? I had something in this pocket, and now—&quot;\n\nHis voice died away in a thick gasp of alarm. He had recognised the loiterer as the young man who had been with the detective and constable at Canal Street. He ducked his head and pulled a map from the car.\n\n&quot;All right, I&#39;ve got it,&quot; he mumbled.\n\nPeg-Leg swung round and limped swiftly back to the house. Obeying his master&#39;s instructions, Tommy walked slowly out of the square and hailed a taxi from the nearest rank.\n\n&quot;Dover Street,&quot; he said briefly.\n\nTommy looked back as they drove round the fringe of Hyde Park. He saw a familiar two-seater dodging through the traffic. Peg-Leg was following.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nTommy the Decoy\n\nDixon Hawke was sprawling in his chair near the window, puffing at a pipe, when Tommy came in.\n\nThe young fellow shook his head as he met the quizzing stare of his chief.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; he said. &quot;It cost me three quid to keep hidden from Peg-Leg while I followed him, and then you go and make me let him know who I am.&quot;\n\nHawke laughed.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry, young &#39;un. Your work&#39;s not going to be spoilt. By the way, Tommy, how. are your nerves?&quot;\n\n&quot;Pretty good. Going to give me a shock?&quot;\n\n&quot;No, but you&#39;ll have a shock tonight. You must stay in this house for the rest of the day, and round about midnight you can go to bed—with the window open.&quot;\n\n&quot;A bird might fly in, chief.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m hoping a very big bird will fly in,&quot; Hawke said quietly.\n\nFor the rest of the day Tommy lounged round, reading, and wondering what scheme the criminologist had formed. Obviously he was expecting a visit from Levy&#39;s murderer, but for the life of him the young fellow could not see the connection between the Bird Burglar and Peg-Leg.\n\nCertainly a man who had no legs could not be under suspicion.\n\nBig Ben was booming midnight when Tommy went to his room. Acting on Dixon Hawke&#39;s instructions, he did not undress. Instead he went to the window and leaned his arms on the sill, looking down into narrow Dover Street. It was moonlight, and even in this war-time London there were still a number of people moving about, coming from the neighbouring clubs, but in another hour all would be still.\n\nFinally Tommy yawned, and, stretching himself, left the window, and lay down on his bed.\n\nA soft tap came at the door, and Dixon Hawke&#39;s lean figure slipped into the room. He stretched himself on the floor by Tommy&#39;s bed, and placed an automatic by his side.\n\n&quot;I once went hunting tigers in India this way,&quot; he whispered. &quot;We had a goat tied up for bait.&quot;\n\n&quot;And so I&#39;m the goat,&quot; Tommy grinned.\n\nThey were silent. Long minutes ticked by, and the noise of the vast city slowly died down. Tommy was sleepy and began to doze. He had forgotten, until he came to bed, that he had not slept the previous night.\n\nA sharp, clicking noise had come from somewhere. Tommy wondered if he was still dreaming, and looked slowly round the dark room. Suddenly he was wide awake.\n\nWhen he glanced at the window he was sure that he was mixed up in a nightmare.\n\nSomething black sailed up against the sky. It was the figure of a man. For half a second it seemed to remain poised in mid-air, and then dropped again below the level of the window. Tommy saw a pair of large hands hook over the sill. The creature was there, clinging to the ledge of his window after rising a sheer thirty feet into the air.\n\nSlowly a head and then a pair of shoulders came over the sill. The Bird Burglar waited a moment, and then pulled his body into the room. He stood there crouching, looking towards the bed with eyes that glittered in the darkness.\n\nTommy knew that he could not last out much longer. He would have to jump up and yell. He had never been so scared in his life. The creature approaching him was absolutely ghostly.\n\nAbruptly a vivid beam of light snapped out from the other side of the bed.\n\n&quot;Put up your hands!&quot; roared the voice of Dixon Hawke.\n\nA muffled cry came from the raider. He stood for about a second blinking through the silk mask which covered his face. Then suddenly he threw up his hands.\n\nA white powder filled the room, and was carried towards Hawke and Tommy by the draught from the open window. They coughed and then began to sneeze violently. The Bird Burglar had flung sneezing powder at them, and no better weapon could have been used to break from the trap which had been set for him.\n\nTurning, he put one hand on the sill of the window and vaulted out. Hawke&#39;s gun roared twice but the shots were wide. It was impossible to shoot straight when caught by a fit of sneezing.\n\nThe criminologist and his assistant ran to the window. They were in time to see the raider strike the centre of the road, landing on his feet like a cat. Instead of rolling over seriously injured, he bounced up a good ten feet with a sharp, clicking noise. To and fro he hopped like some gigantic bird.\n\nSuddenly from the basement of a club over the way several men emerged. A whistle shrilled, and two more parties of men appeared to left and right of the hopping murderer. They closed in with a swift rush.\n\n&quot;Ah, Baxter and his flying squad men didn&#39;t fail me!&quot; Hawke said.\n\nTommy sneezed.\n\n&quot;Gosh!&quot; he gasped. &quot;That blighter almost got away. Sneezing powder! What a trick to pull on us!&quot;\n\n&quot;We&#39;d better be in on this,&quot; said Hawke, and the pair hurried down to the street. The officers had secured their prisoner, who lay on the ground, spitting defiance.\n\n&quot;A wooden-legged man, Mr. Hawke,&quot; Detective-Inspector Baxter said. &quot;He popped into the air like a clay pigeon shot oil at a rifle range.&quot;\n\nHawke nodded.\n\n&quot;The Bird Burglar,&quot; he said. &quot;Alias our friend Peg-Leg of Shoreditch. Alias Captain Gosling, the war hero of Laurel Gardens.&quot;\n\nQuickly he unstrapped one of the man&#39;s artificial legs. He turned it to show the rubber pad, which was fitted on the end of the stump. In the rubber was the design of a bird&#39;s claw.\n\n&quot;So much for the clawmarks,&#39;&#39; he said. &quot;Now to show you how this man flew.&quot;\n\nHe threw the leg sharply down on the pavement. With a click it bounced nearly six feet into the air.\n\n&quot;A spring!&quot; gasped Tommy.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; Hawke added. &quot;These stumps consist of two tubes sliding one inside the other, and containing a powerful spring. Here is a rack arrangement by which the springs can be drawn up. By releasing this catch the wearer of the legs would be shot into the air. When he dropped back the shock of the fall would compress the springs far enough to throw him to a third-storey window.&quot; He smiled as he watched the expressions of amazement on the faces of his audience.\n\n&quot;Of course, the man had to know how to balance, and I expect Peg-Leg had some bad falls before he learned the art. Then he was able to stage those sensational robberies, and finally the murder. Nobody would suspect a poor cripple who trundled along on a trolley.&quot;\n\n&quot;And I suppose he made such a good thing out of his crimes that he was able to keep that smart flat on Laurel Gardens,&quot; Tommy whistled. &quot;What I would like to know, chief, is how you began to suspect him.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, that began when Constable Simpson told me about the cat which ran by him, scared to death, just before Levy screamed. Obviously it had been frightened by something unusual—very likely somebody bounding twenty feet from the alley to Levy&#39;s&#39; window. When I looked round I noticed how the bird marks became fainter as the raider hopped round. I realised that must be caused by the man getting nearer to the ground with each hop, and at once I decided that he was a Spring-heeled Jack.&quot;\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n&quot;After that I was lucky. I saw Peg-Leg, realised that there was something mysterious about him, and when Tommy found out what it was, I gambled on what the Americans call a hunch. I knew that if Gosling was the Bird Burglar he would come and try to kill Tommy, realising that he knew too much.&quot;\n\n&quot;I was the goat for the tiger hunt, chief,&quot; Tommy grinned.\n\n&quot;Yes, you were the decoy,&quot; said Dixon Hawke.\n\n&quot;And it certainly worked,&quot; added Tommy.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

He even eats very silly. We are in a School Street beanery one night, and he orders herring and fried eggs for dinner. It is almost a riot he causes, and I says to him will he excuse me a minute as I wish to go next door. Two minutes later, when I come in with a handkerchief tied over my pan, the peroxide-toupeed doll at the cash register yells very loudly: &quot;Ha-a-alp! Pole-e-ece! Robbery!&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, rest your pipes,&quot; I says testily. &quot;I am only trying to shut out a smell.&quot;\n\nIt is some time before I can convince the proprietor of the joint that I am not an unlawful citizen. Then I says to Snooty Piper I wish a bone would get crisscrossed in his windpipe.\n\n&quot;That is an awful mess to eat, you crackpot!&quot; I toss at him.\n\nSnooty pays no attention and completes his gastronomic orgy with quite some gusto, and when he eats his pie, he says it tastes awful funny.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s the same fork you mauled the fish with, dope,&quot; I says. &quot;Did you expect it to taste of persimmons?&quot;\n\n&quot;Bring me a clean fork,&quot; Snooty squawks at the dame who juggles the trays. &quot;What kind of a jernt is this, anyhow?&quot;\n\nSnooty and me go down later to the Greek&#39;s, where the crackpot drinks six steins of suds without taking a breath. He still smells of Nova Scotia cologne, and a couple of alley cats come into the grog shop and climb all over him.\n\n&quot;You should get air-conditioned, Snooty,&quot; I tell him, &quot;or go and buy a nice lavender sachet.&quot;\n\nI am still thinking up some more very cutting insults when the phone rings like it meant business. The Greek answers it and yells that it is for either me or Snooty Piper.\n\n&quot;Queek, she soun&#39; like she is been the hurry for wanting to see somebody. She ees the ceety&#39;s editor for what works for you.&quot;\n\nSnooty says, &quot;Answer, Scoop,&quot; and I do. It is Dogface Woolsey over at Mr. Guppy&#39;s Evening Star, and what he says to me is quite startling. I jump right off the floor, half of my noggin going through the top of the phone booth.\n\nI says: &quot;We will hurry to her side right now, Dogface. Oh, that&#39;s awful!&quot;\n\nI run out and grab Snooty and holler: &quot;Hurry up and grab your skimmer, as what do you think has happened?&quot;\n\n&quot;They&#39;ve found Judge Crater,&quot; the crackpot says, taking a pull at another beaker of hop elixir.\n\n&quot;How does he look?&quot;\n\n&quot;It is Abigail. There has been a murder out at her house. Her  —  her pet Angora cat has been kidnaped. She is hysterical. Somebody bumped off the bosco who was takin&#39; it out for its evenin&#39; constitution. Step on it. Snooty!&quot;\n\n&quot;Abigail?&quot; he gulps and forgets his thirst. &quot;To horse!&quot;\n\nNow Abigail Hepplethwaite is a rich old jill who lives out in Back Bay. She could finance three wars in Europe for ten years and still not make a dent in her rock pile. Me and Snooty are quite well acquainted with the old girl and have even joined her at times in a game of rummy.\n\n&quot;That catnip sniffer!&quot; Snooty pants as we dive into a swindle chariot. &quot;She thought more of it than her right leg. It&#39;ll kill her, Scoop! Here is where we fight to the bitter end. I will track down the dishonest criminal, if I have to crawl all the way to Little America on my hands and knees.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nCatnipper — Kitnappers — Nipcatters\n\n\n\nWhen we get to Abigail&#39;s tepee, which is all lighted up like the Boston Garden and which is twice as big, we find that Iron Jaw O&#39;Shaughnessy is already there looking for clues. Iron Jaw is a detective who has solved as many cases in Beantown as a fish has feathers. One or two big policemen are trying to calm Abigail, but the old girl is quite furious. She is giving them quite a bashing around with her lorgnette, which weighs almost as much as the stone bench she is sitting on.\n\n&quot;Do something — find something that will lead me to Queen Victoria&#39;s abductor!&quot; she wails.\n\n&quot;O&#39;Shaughnessy, why are you here? You could not find the tracks of a twenty-ton truck in the snow! Oh, where are those reporters? Where&#39;s Piper an&#39; —  Oh, there they are!&quot;\n\n&quot;Hello, Ab — er — Miss Hepplethwaite,&quot; Snooty says briskly, stepping on Iron Jaw&#39;s fingers as the big, talking boxcar moves around on the grass on his hands and knees in search of clues. &quot;We did not tarry. Where&#39;s the remains?&quot;\n\nIron Jaw&#39;s howl of pain almost drowns out the answer, but Abigail hollers lustily: &quot;Over there by the rose arbor! It is my gardener, Olaf Kumquat.&quot;\n\nThe old girl wrings her hands in distress.\n\n&quot;Somebody hit him with the top of that bird bath, and I think he is dead. Oh, poor Queen Victoria, where are you, my lambie pie?&quot;\n\n&quot;You think he is dead, huh?&quot; Snooty queries, while Iron Jaw breathes on his digits. &quot;I never was so sure of anything in my life, even that Iron Jaw is a moron. Olaf is out like the Chicago fire, I am quite convinced. It was quite a hefty taxpayer who massaged him with the masonry. What do you think was the motive?&quot;\n\n&quot;Murder,&quot; I says, and Snooty kicks me on the shin.\n\n&quot;Oh, I know,&quot; Abigail cries, &quot;it is ransom they want for Queen Victoria. Oh, I&#39;ll pay it! Anything up to a million smackers. Life doesn&#39;t matter to me without that cat. I will pay it, and don&#39;t you dare interfere, any of you policemen. I — &quot;\n\n&quot;There is a citizen who has been rubbed out,&quot; Snooty reminds her. &quot;That is very illegal, and you will be aidin&#39; an&#39; abettin&#39; criminal characters if — &quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah,&quot; Iron Jaw bellows, &quot;we will not stand by and let a criminal evade punishment just because of an alley cat!&quot;\n\nBingo! It was Iron Jaw&#39;s number, and it seemed to be up. The lorgnette smacked the flatfoot right on the scalp, and I says to the coroner who just trotted up with his valise: &quot;You can look at either body first. It does not matter.&quot;\n\n&quot;Anybody else want to insult my cat?&quot; Abigail growls belligerently.\n\n&quot;Nice kitty,&quot; I says fast.\n\nThe coroner looks at the late Olaf Kumquat, and he states that the gardener is quite dead.\n\nIron Jaw begins to move just as the corpse diagnostician feels of his pulse. The big slewfoot scrambles up waving his arms and sounding very energetic. &quot;You bet, men, let&#39;s start trackin&#39; them catnipper — kitnappers — nipcatters. We&#39;ll leave no tones unsturned. We&#39;ll —  Where am I?&quot;\n\n&quot;Here, Iron Jaw,&quot; Snooty says. &quot;It is a murder — remember?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yah,&quot; I says. &quot;And it&#39;s the cats!&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Muscle-Bound Biscuit Burner\n\nAbigail gets very impatient and threatens to call up the mayor and have everybody fired. I do not blame her very much and ask her a question very quickly.\n\n&quot;Who have you fired lately?&quot;\n\n&quot;Why — er — I had a cook I had to let go,&quot; the old girl answers me, loosening up her nerves. &quot;She was almost as big as Iron Jaw, but even dumber. She put meringue on a meat pie and washed the celery with soap flakes.&quot;\n\n&quot;She could have nailed Olaf with the chickadee font, easy, huh?&quot; Snooty suggests.\n\n&quot;Why — er — she certainly could!&quot; Abigail exclaims, and Iron Jaw steps in close.\n\n&quot;I saw her lift the back end of an ice truck one morning to get it off her foot. I&#39;ll bet she came back here and stole Queen Victoria! All right, go and arrest her, somebody! She did it to get even. She — &quot;\n\n&quot;It is quite hasty we&#39;re getting,&quot; Snooty observes. &quot;It is circumstantial evidence. Let us look around a little more first. I am sure that criminals always slip up and leave a clue.&quot;\n\n&quot;Piper, I am disappointed in you,&quot; Abigail sniffs. &quot;Iron Jaw, maybe I have misjudged you. That muscle-bound biscuit burner&#39;s name is Henrietta Trilby, and she lives in East Boston. I&#39;ve got her house number somewhere. I&#39;ll get it for you. You&#39;ll find she has stolen Queen Victoria, I&#39;ll bet. Oh, Victoria&#39;ll die if she doesn&#39;t get her liver on time! She is a very delicate cat, and —  Poor Olaf! I have been very neglectful of him, haven&#39;t I, boys?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, you have overlooked him a bit,&quot; Snooty agrees. &quot;Did Olaf have any relatives?&quot;\n\nAbigail shook her head. She said that the horticultural citizen had always been very close-mouthed and that his tongue must be as good as new.\n\n&quot;Well, get the body outta here,&quot; Iron Jaw trumpets. &quot;Let&#39;s get goin&#39;, men. All we got to do is grab that kitchen mechanic an&#39; put her on the griddle. The victim here with the mashed noggin caught her sneakin&#39; outta the joint with the cat, and he got put on ice for keeps with the bird bathtub. Now — er — Miss Hepplethwaite, if you&#39;ll give me the address of that Powerful Katinka — &quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s in the house,&quot; says Abigail, and she starts up the walk. The dead-wagon boys put Olaf Kumquat into a wicker smock, and that is the last we see of him.\n\nI follow Iron Jaw and another very large gendarme up to the house, where Abigail has already handed over the address of Henrietta&#39;s manage. Suddenly I miss Snooty Piper, and so does Abigail.\n\n&quot;Where is that halfwit?&quot; the old doll asks. &quot;If he is walkin&#39; in my pansy bed, he&#39;ll never sleep in his again. Pi-i-i-ip-er!&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, good-night everybody.&quot; Iron Jaw thunders. &quot;I will have Henrietta all trussed up for the braising boudoir when I see you again.&quot;\n\n&quot;Volts for women, huh?&quot; I says.\n\nNobody laughs, as somebody is coming in singing. It is Snooty Piper, sounding like a mighty pipe organ, as he hollers: &quot;Ma-a-a-any br-r-ra-ave hear-r-rts are asle-e-ep in the dee-e-e-ep, so be-e- war-r-re, be-e-e-ewa-r-r-re! O-h-h-h, the bell e-e-eyun the-e-e o-o-old t-oower r-i-i-ings, Oh sa-a-ail-or be-war-r-re!&quot;\n\n&quot;Snooty Piper,&quot; Abigail yips, &quot;if you&#39;ve been in my wine cellar. I&#39;ll — &quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, I was eatin&#39; fish earlier this evening, and I feel very salty, ha, ha,&quot; Snooty chirps. &quot;How are you, Scoop?&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll send the wagon back for him, Miss Hepplethwaite,&quot; Iron Jaw promises. &quot;Just humor him a little.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n“I&#39;m Innercent”\n\nTen minutes after Iron Jaw O&#39;Shaughnessy has pulled out of the estate. Snooty says he is quite sure that Henrietta has not stolen the long-haired feline and that everybody has been acting quite hastily about it all.\n\n&quot;We should look into Olaf Kumquat&#39;s room over the garage and see what kind of a past the taxpayer had,&quot; Snooty declares.\n\n&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Abigail says. &quot;My feet hurt. I am sure Queen Victoria will be back in her basket before midnight. It should look quite simple even to you, Piper. I fired the cook. The cook got burned up worse than her cakes. The cook came back. She stole the cat.&quot;\n\n&quot;Did Henrietta knit?&quot; Snooty asks.\n\n&quot;Huh? Why, yes, she did,&quot; Abigail answers. &quot;So what, Watson? Ha, ha, you find a needle?&quot;\n\n&quot;It looks like I can expect no co-operation here, Scoop,&quot; the green-suited crackpot sniffs. &quot;I will leave. Come on.&quot;\n\n&quot;And don&#39;t cross that flower bed, Piper!&quot; the old girl hollers.\n\n&quot;Oh, go drop a stitch!&quot; Snooty snorts, and Abigail sicks a great Dane on us. We beat it to a taxi two blocks away by the length of the Dane&#39;s whiskers.\n\n&quot;Now she is mad at us,&quot; I says to him. &quot;You would stab Santy Claus, you nitwit.&quot;\n\n&quot;The old girl&#39;s slipping,&quot; the numbskull declares. &quot;She believes that Iron Jaw O&#39;Shaughnessy is right.&quot;\n\n&quot;I am bettin&#39; on Abigail,&quot; I says. &quot;I suppose you picked up a footmark in the grass, huh? What were you doin&#39; out there while — &quot;\n\nSnooty ignores me and tells the driver of the hack to go down to headquarters. When we walk in we find that Henrietta Trilby is already quite securely in the hands of the law. After one look at the kitchen flunkey, I am sure she could have murdered Olaf Kumquat with a corner of Fenway Park just as easy as with the bird bath. Henrietta is built like a concrete mixer, and a blacksmith could very easily bend horseshoes into shape over her lower jaw. The amazon keeps trying to land a fist on Iron Jaw&#39;s chin every time he sticks it out to ask a question.\n\n&quot;Come clean, Henrietta,&quot; the big flat- foot bellows, keeping up his footwork. &quot;Look at the white hairs on your coat. They are from the tabby cat. You are guilty of rubbing out Olaf Kumquat. You crocked him with the b — &quot;\n\n&quot;Ya&#39;re a liar, ya big hogshead,&quot; the cook says. &quot;Them white hairs was offen a furpiece I had stole from me in a movie joint. I&#39;m innercent, an&#39; if I ever git outta this can, I&#39;ll sink my fist into ya so far they&#39;ll have to operate t&#39;git it out! Ha-a-ah, I caught ya a pretty one that time!&quot;\n\nIron Jaw reels around, feeling his bugle, and when it comes away, it looks like a stop-light. Me and Snooty have to laugh, and the gendarmes throw us out into LeGrange Street.\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; I says as we head for the Greek&#39;s, &quot;you saw them white hairs on her coat. That tags her. Boy, is she dumb not thinkin&#39; to brush herself off? I will &#39;phone Dogface all I know.&quot;\n\n&quot;That will take but a second or two,&quot; the fresh yap says. &quot;You are just as dumb as Iron Jaw an&#39; Abigail. I will show the commonwealth that they are persecuting a defenseless woman.&quot;\n\n&quot;If she is,&quot; I snort, &quot;a saber-toothed tiger is a pushover for a mouse.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh-h-h sa-a-ailor be-war-r-re. Sailor be-war-r-r-e — &quot;\n\n&quot;Listen,&quot; I says, very solemn, &quot;I can stand just so much, Snooty Piper. Look, everybody is watchin&#39; you — and that cop is gettin&#39; ready to —  Hurry up and let&#39;s get to the Greek&#39;s.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nFifty Thousand Dollars For Queen Victoria\n\nSnooty Piper takes something from his pocket at a table in the Greek&#39;s, and it is a long piece of steel with some yam sticking to it. &quot;I found it in the rose bower,&quot; he says. &quot;It is Exhibit A.&quot;\n\n&quot;You take it right down to headquarters,&quot; I says, &quot;you crook! You are stoppin&#39; the wheels of justice, an&#39; it proves that Henrietta Trilby assassinated Olaf, the plant nurse. Snooty, you hear me?&quot;\n\n&quot;How could I help it even if I was deef?&quot; he retorts. &quot;Don&#39;t you notice anything unusual when I show it to you up close? Concentrate, Scoop.&quot;\n\n&quot;It is still a knittin&#39; needle, and a big one,&quot; I says. &quot;If that female Carnera weighed another pound, she would make doilies with crowbars. That will land her right on the toasting sofa.&quot;\n\nSnooty shakes his noggin quite wearily. &quot;You will never be a criminologist, Scoop. Still, how could you think like a citizen who eats a lot of fish like me. Ha, ha!&quot;\n\n&quot;I shudder when I think what you would be like if you never ate any fish,&quot; I counter. &quot;Well, let&#39;s go and pick up a morning journal and read the news.&quot;\n\n&quot;If you was a subway guard,&quot; Snooty says, &quot;you would spend your two weeks&#39; vacation in a coal mine. But maybe we should read and improve our minds, huh?&quot;\n\nThe early edition of the Beantown morning rag only tells us what we already know. Iron Jaw O&#39;Shaughnessy promises the public that he will have Henrietta&#39;s confession on the records before the next lunch hour before the workaday world heaves into sight. The paper says that Abigail Hepplethwaite is quite ready to forgive Henrietta if she will only take down her hair and own up where she cached the feline. But Henrietta is quoted as saying that she does not have any idea where the liver destroyer is, and what is more, does not give a hoot in Hades. The morning rag says that the prisoner has assaulted one Aloysius O&#39;Shaughnessy, among other things.\n\n&quot;I would imagine that if Henrietta ever proved her innocence,&quot; Snooty remarks as we evacuate the beer joint, &quot;Iron Jaw would purchase a one-way ticket to Tahiti, don&#39;t you think?&quot;\n\n&quot;I wish to forget the whole thing,&quot; I says. &quot;Let the law take its course, as Henrietta Trilby is a very dangerous citizen.&quot;\n\nThe next morning, Abigail comes to the Star office waving a letter around her skimmer. She yells for Mr. Guppy, but he is not present. Dogface Woolsey has to do.\n\n&quot;They have written me,&quot; she says. &quot;That woman&#39;s confederates want fifty thousand dollars before they&#39;ll give back Queen Victoria. We can&#39;t let the police know. Er — hello, boys!&quot;\n\n&quot;Mornin&#39;,&quot; I says, but Snooty snubs her.\n\n&quot;I want somebody to go to where they tell me to put the money with me,&quot; the old doll says, getting her grammar quite scrambled, &quot;so they won&#39;t dare to grab me, too. Huh, this is to be kept quiet, as I am willing to pay. What is fifty thousand dollars?&quot;\n\nSnooty snaps his fingers. &quot;I would not even stoop to pick up such a pittance. You are a sucker, Miss Hepplethwaite! You are encouraging crime and should be ashamed of yourself. You will let the unlawful element go free to snatch other things. Maybe somebody&#39;s mother will lose her little child. It is appalling, to say the least. I will tell the public if you —  I will call the police, for I will not stand aside and — &quot;\n\nAbigail picks up Dogface Woolsey&#39;s bottle of ink and throws it at Snooty, but it goes right through a brand-new pane of glass in the door that has OSWALD GUPPY, PRESIDENT, on it in gold letters.\n\n&quot;Come on, Scoop!&quot; Snooty yells. &quot;I am going to find Olaf&#39;s murderer before the state&#39;s chef roasts Henrietta. Well, anyway she is a cook and can tell them when they have her well done!&quot;\n\nI only follow Snooty because Abigail tries to hit me with a paste jar. I get into a taxi with him and almost swallow my bridgework when he tells the bandit driving the cab to go to Back Bay.\n\n&quot;We got to get there before Abigail gets home,&quot; the crackpot says. &quot;I must look into Olaf&#39;s shanty.&quot;\n\n&quot;That will be breaking and entering,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Don&#39;t you ever get scared of anything?&quot;\n\n&quot;Only school teachers,&quot; he retorts. &quot;Is this as fast as you can go, driver?&quot;\n\n&quot;Go much slower and I will pay you double,&quot; I says.\n\n&quot;Drive faster!&quot; Snooty snaps.\n\n&quot;Say, I ain&#39;t no Siamese twins,&quot; the swindle-bus jockey snaps. &quot;Make up your minds.&quot;\n\nI refuse to follow Snooty into Abigail&#39;s grounds when we get to her place. &quot;I&#39;ll sit right here,&quot; I says. &quot;I have met that great Dane, and he don&#39;t purr. Ha, ha, I will be prayin&#39; for you!&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nHow&#39;s Your Liver?\n\nThe crackpot could crawl into a sewer and come out with a bouquet of orchids. In about fifteen minutes he comes over the hedge, and he is grinning like he won the Irish Sweepstakes.\n\n&quot;A big guy tried to stop me,&quot; he says, &quot;But I showed him my G-man&#39;s badge and he gave me three dames to call up and held the pooch while I looked into the place where Kumquat used to live. Come, come. Oh-h-h lou-oudly the bell e-eyun t h e-e-c o-o-old to-ow-wer ri-i-ings. Sa-a-ailor, ta-a-ake care. Sa-a-ailor be- wa-rr-re!&quot;\n\n&quot;Where ya wanna go?&quot; the hack driver snarls. &quot;I ain&#39;t physic!&quot;\n\n&quot;Sailors Snug Harbor. Take us to India Wharf. Maybe I&#39;ll sign up for a hitch around the Horn. Stow ya gab, matey, or I&#39;ll keel haul ya! Thar-r-r she blows!&quot;\n\n&quot;Ah — er — s&#39;long, Snooty,&quot; I says hastily. &quot;Driver, stop this cab and then keep on goin&#39; to Danvers. I been expectin&#39; this for weeks. He is violent an&#39; — &quot;\n\n&quot;Huh? A nut? Er — ya mean — &quot; The citizen stops the cab very suddenly, and when I pick myself out from under the dash, he is gone.\n\n&quot;Let him go,&quot; Snooty says serenely. &quot;His picture and address are here. We will give him back the boiler after we are through with it. Quite skittish, ain&#39;t he?&quot;\n\n&quot;Listen here,&quot; I says, &quot;what is your name? What day is this? Who is president? Where was you born?&quot;\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t be silly, Scoop,&quot; the crackpot says and gets into the driver&#39;s seat. Before I have my marbles all back, we are getting out of the cab near India Wharf and walking into a butcher shop.\n\nThe citizen at the block bangs the leg of a cow in half with one lusty wallop and then roars: &quot;What&#39;ll it be?&quot;\n\n&quot;How&#39;s your liver?&quot; Snooty asks him.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t git fresh, or I&#39;ll rip that green burlap from top to bottom an&#39; it&#39;ll fall right away from you!&quot; the meat carver bays, eying Snooty&#39;s bright-green suit.\n\nSnooty flashes that badge. I try to reach for a cleaver, but he pushes me out of the way and asks: &quot;Have you sold much liver lately, sir? I am of the F.B.I. and demand some respect. Any guys come in and buy liver? Beef liver from a cow?&quot;\n\n&quot;You couldn&#39;t git it out of no turkey,&quot; the butcher counters. &quot;Er — -say, dat&#39;s right — I was tryin&#39; t&#39;figger it out. Mostly it&#39;s skirts what comes in an&#39; buys the meat, but this time it was a big swab what walked like a duck. He bought all I had.&quot;\n\n&quot;Describe him!&quot; Snooty demands, like he had authority.\n\n&quot;Aw, he had an ugly mug wit&#39; a beezer that looked like it lost in a argyment wit&#39; a pile driver,&quot; the butcher says. &quot;The guy had a big gold tooth, an&#39; his ears was as big as flapjacks. I fink he was a sailor from one of them scows out there. They come in here this time of year wit&#39; salt mackerel. I says, what ya want wit&#39; all that liver? An&#39; he says: &#39;What ya t&#39;ink, nosey? A guy&#39;s gotta have a spare, just in case.&#39; An then he gives me the laugh.&quot;\n\n&quot;I suppose he killed Olaf Kumquat, huh?&quot; I sneer. &quot;I s&#39;pose a tough citizen like that one that bought liver, crochets ? What if he did buy liver? Ifs been bein&#39; et.&quot;\n\n&quot;What terrible language you use,&quot; Snooty chides me. &quot;Let&#39;s go down and look at the ships, Scoop. The sea is in my blood at times. O-h-h-h, sa-a-ailor, be- war-r-r-e! Sailor, ta-a-ake car-r-r-e — &quot;\n\n&quot;Ha, ha,&quot; I says. &quot;Okay, Snooty, it is ail right. I understand. Jus&#39; take it easy, as Scoop Binney understands you!&quot;\n\n&quot;You think I&#39;m nutty, huh?&quot; he bridles. I&#39;ll show you.&quot;\n\nThe crackpot goes down to the dock, and I don&#39;t have no more sense than to follow. There is a schooner tied up, and big white letters on the stern tell the world that she is &quot;Betsy Boop&quot; A bosco is hanging over the rail, looking at us, and he does not look like Freddy Bartholomew.\n\n&quot;Ahoy!&quot; Snooty hollers as he climbs aboard the packet, which does not smell like it carried coffee. &quot;Where ye bound?&quot;\n\n&quot;Huh?&quot; the very tough tar grunts. He is wearing a big sweater, which looks home made, and Snooty says in a whisper to me: &quot;I bet you think a citizen with that awful mug would have a dame to knit for him, huh?&quot;\n\n&quot;Where&#39;s the skipper?&quot; he asks out loud. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll sign on.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ha-a-a-h!&quot; laughs the big tar. &quot;You panty waists couldn&#39;t outfight a smelt much less a mackerel. Don&#39;t make me laff, &#39;cause me lips is cracked. If ya want the skipper, he&#39;s down in his cabin.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nSkullbuster Boody\n\nThere does not seem to be a crowd of seagoing citizens on the tub, and Snooty explains that they go ashore and get scalded to the ears after being out on the fishing banks for months.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s the idea?&quot; I whisper at him as he goes down a ladder. &quot;You think Henrietta&#39;s confederates are here, huh? Maybe they will fool you and show cards that say they are in the Union Army. Ha, ha!&quot;\n\n&quot;Shut up,&quot; Snooty breathes back at me. &quot;Don&#39;t look now, but I think the very tough citizen on deck is follerin&#39; us down.&quot; He takes something from his pockets and drops it when we get down into where the crew of the &quot;Betsy Boop&quot; gets in out of the weather. It is the knitting needle with the yarn around it. I open my mouth, but Snooty closes it.\n\n&quot;Shh-h-h! I am lishin&#39;,&quot; he says.\n\nJust then I hear something. It says, &quot;Me-e-o-ow!&quot;\n\n&quot;What was that?&quot; I gulp.\n\n&quot;A dog, Scoop,&quot; Snooty snorts. &quot;What did you think? We&#39;re getting warm.&quot;\n\n&quot;I am afraid we will be as cold as a cod on ice in very short order,&quot; I quaver, &quot;if we don&#39;t get out of here.&quot;\n\n&quot;Avast there, ya swabs!&quot;\n\nIt is not a very musical voice that turns us around as if we are on casters. A big bosco is standing in a doorway. If he leaned against the Statue of Liberty, France would have to send us another one.\n\n&quot;Uh — er — look at the nose an&#39; his ears,&quot; Snooty gulps. &quot;Er — we are lookin&#39; for the skipper of this tub. We would like to go fishin&#39;. Are you the captain?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah,&quot; the massive mariner blows. &quot;I&#39;m him! Skullbuster Boody, that&#39;s me! Who wants ta know?&quot;\n\n&quot;Why — er — &quot; I begin. &quot;Snooty, tell him.&quot;\n\nIt is just then that the big bosco from up on deck comes down and hands Boody something. &quot;I foun&#39; it, skipper,&quot; he says. &quot;Dat knittin&#39; needle ya lost. Right at the foot of the ladder.&quot;\n\nI am almost ready to faint when the rough sea citizen says: &quot;Huh, I been lookin&#39; all over for it. I wouldn&#39; never git them mittens done without it. T&#39;anks, Keelhaul.&quot;\n\n&quot;You knit, huh?&quot; Snooty laughs. &quot;Ha, ha! I&#39;ll never be surprised at anythin&#39; any more, even if I see Iron Jaw O&#39;Shaughnessy hemstitchin&#39; lace curtains.&quot;\n\n&quot;Iron Jaw — who?&quot; Skullbuster trumpets, his glimmers getting very meanlooking. &quot;Ain&#39;t he a dete — &quot;\n\n&quot;Ah — er — I got to git some air. Snooty,&quot; I says. &quot;I will see you upstairs.&quot; Snooty is taking a gander at a yellowed sheet of paper he has in his hand. Before I can stop the crackpot, he says: &quot;Boody, once you sailed on the &#39;Minnis Ha Ha,&#39; didn&#39;t you?&quot;\n\nSkullbuster looks at the other salty bosco, and I can see he almost swallows his chew.\n\n&quot;What if I did?&quot; he growls at Snooty and almost blows off his green hat.\n\n&quot;There was a taxpayer on the same boat by the name of Olaf Kumquat. He was the skipper. I s&#39;pose you know Olaf is already as cold as a stepmother&#39;s kiss down in Davey Jones&#39; tepee, huh? It seems that Olaf was taking a very longhaired, white tabby cat for a trot around a garden and a very dishonest character hit him with a birdie&#39;s bath and stole the liver punisher. Own up, Boody. Where is the feline? That is the knitting needle I found near the scene of the crime!&quot;\n\n&quot;Run, Snooty!&quot; I holler, and I have quite a good start. I do not reach the ladder, because something smacks me on the coco, and it is not a truffle. I go head first into the tub&#39;s galley, and I can hear Skullbuster&#39;s swearing as he goes about killing Snooty Piper. I see a tea kettle on a stove when I get my marbles back and it is steaming.\n\nJust as the tough tar who has smacked me comes in to deliver the coup de grace, I pour the hot water right on his tootsies, and he tries to pick up both Great Danes at the same time. He howls very earnestly. I hit him with a soup kettle and then go out to help Snooty. He needs assistance very badly, as Skullbuster Boody has got him down and has his neck in both hands.\n\nThere is quite some slack at the back of Boody&#39;s pantaloons, and I pour the contents of the teakettle right into it. You never heard even an Indian on the warpath make more of a fuss. Skullbuster lets go of Snooty and rolls all over the deck. Then I hit him over the scalp with the empty kettle.\n\nSnooty Piper&#39;s face is quite blue, like fountain pen ink, and I am sure Skullbuster took two half hitches in his windpipe, for it is almost three minutes before the crackpot can talk.\n\n&quot;Th-thanks, Scoop,&quot; he gasps. &quot;How did you do it?&quot;\n\n&quot;Shut up,&quot; I tosses back at him. &quot;Let&#39;s get the cat and vamoose. Oh, you can get me into the worst — &quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nQueen Victoria\n\nWe go into Skullbuster&#39;s cabin, and there is Queen Victoria sitting quite cramped up in a parrot&#39;s cage. She is very indignant and even makes a pass at Snooty when he springs her. I jump for a very ugly-looking roscoe that Boody has right next to his bunk, and it is a very smart move because the two tough boys are ready to get quite nasty again. They come in waving fish knives around their noggins and tell us they will insert them right into our gills.\n\n&quot;Oh ye-e-eah?&quot; I says, pointing the cannon at the rough tars. &quot;M-make a sh-sh-shoot an&#39; I&#39;ll m-m-move. P-put up y-y-your bb-b-rains or I w-w-will blow y-your h-hands out. H-hurry, Snooty! Up the stairs and h-holler for help!&quot;\n\nBang! It is very nervous I am, and I do not mean to shoot. The slug goes right through the top of Snooty&#39;s hat and kicks a knife out of Skullbuster&#39;s hand.\n\n&quot;Did you f-forget I was with you?&quot; Snooty hollers.\n\n&quot;Go and yell for help,&quot; I says. &quot;We are not in the Y.M.C.A., you halfwit!&quot;\n\nSnooty Piper gets by the rough mariners and is carrying Queen Victoria by the collar like she is a valise. In a minute or so I hear Snooty hollering, and I am sure even the Northwest Mounted heard him. In a very few minutes we have three big policemen and some waterfront taxpayers down in the &quot;Betsy Boop,&quot; and they have at the pair of dishonest characters and truss them up.\n\n&quot;This is the Hepplethwaite cat!&quot; Snooty yells. &quot;Skullbuster Boody here is the assassin of Olaf Kumquat. He dropped a knittin&#39; needle, the sissy! It&#39;ll send him to the toasting salon at Charleston. Hello, Scoop. I am quite pleased with you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Wait until my nerves get unwound,&quot; I says.\n\nIt is not long before we are up at LeGrange Street and have the rough boys in the cooler. Iron Jaw O&#39;Shaughnessy won&#39;t believe us, so Snooty says:\n\n&quot;Listen, when I picked up the knittin&#39; needle with the yarn stickin&#39; to it, I smelled fish. It is like a steel fork you have been eatin&#39; fish with, as the smell sticks to it. I says to myself the assassin is a character who is around fish a lot. I knew that the Popeyes who sailed the briny did a lot of knitting. Ask anybody. So after they arrested Henrietta for having white hairs on her coat, I went and looked into the deceased&#39;s affairs and found that he used to be a seagoing tax-\n\npayer and was once skipper on the &#39;Minnie Ha Ha.&#39; I found a list of his crew, and one was named Boody.\n\n&quot;So I went to a butcher shop near the docks and found out a criminal character had bought out every smack dab of beef liver. Then I says I am on the right trail. I says to myself that the bosco who rubbed out Kumquat found out that his old skipper was a landlubber and was working for a rich old doll. So I figured that the assassin went to see Kumquat to get him to tap Abigail&#39;s safe. But Olaf was indignant and told the tar to scram. Skullbuster figured that any old dame thinks more of her tabby cat than anything, so he snatched the liver guzzler and held it for ransom. Olaf tried to dissuade Boody, but got tapped with the sparrow basin for his trouble.&quot;\n\n&quot;Guessin&#39; again, huh?&quot; Iron Jaw moans. &quot;I — er —  You let me have a half hour start before you let that cook loose! I&#39;ve got a right to protection. I — &quot;\n\n&quot;It wasn&#39;t all guessing,&quot; Snooty argued. &quot;That knitting needle was big enough to pry open a strongbox. And I am a connoisseur of fish. Just give me any knife that has been messing with fish and I will name what brain food it was by the smell. Boody, as you are all quite aware right now, reeks of the finned denizens that he chases. I wish you would open a window here.&quot;\n\nIron Jaw goes out very scared and almost bowls over Abigail Hepplethwaite, who rushes in to get her arms around Queen Victoria.\n\n&quot;Oh, Piper,&quot; she squeals, &quot;name your reward! I hope you&#39;ll forgive me. Name anything!&quot;\n\nI feel very happy as I am quite sure me and Snooty Piper will be taking at least a cruise on the Mediterranean very shortly. I says to myself, Snooty will at least ask for ten thousand.\n\n&quot;Ah — er — &quot; he stammers. &quot;Why — that new maid you&#39;ve got, the one witty the big dark lamps and that ooo — la-la I If you would put in a good word for me — fix it so I can take her out — &quot;\n\n&quot;If she don&#39;t go out with you, Piper,&quot; Abigail says, &quot;she is fired!&quot;\n\nEverybody makes a grab at me because, by now, I have got a cop&#39;s roscoe in my hand and am ready to slay Snooty. Two big policemen drag me into a cell and lock me up.\n\n&quot;It has been quite an ordeal he has been through,&quot; I hear the crackpot tell everybody. &quot;It has unnerved him. Let him out when you think he is all right.&quot;\n\nRight now I am hiding around the corner from where Snooty Piper rooms. He always gets home about one in the A. M. I will leave no clues, as I have already dug a hole to put the iron pipe in.\n\n~ The End ~\n"

If he’d contacted Landis, we’d have seen them.”\n\n“That’s right, Mr. Carter,” Detective Donovan affirmed earnestly. “That guy hasn’t even been to the men’s room without one of us tag-gin’ along; he just couldn’t have met Landis without us knowin’.”\n\n“He just couldn’t have, but he just has,” District Attorney Jeff Carter amended with deadly calm. “Or maybe you two think he pulls those phony tens and twenties out of his hat, the way a magician does rabbits. Louie and Landis are meeting somewhere, and meeting regularly.”\n\nHis voice rose to a sudden roar. “What’s more, they’re doing it right under your stupid noses. Now get back on the job, and this time try tailing Louie with your eyes open; you can tell Greene the same goes for him.”\n\nThe two detectives muttered hasty “Yes, sirs,” and departed from the district attorney’s office with an air of injured dignity which implied that they considered themselves unjustly impugned.\n\nWhen the office door had closed behind them, Jeff spoke to his younger brother Stephen, who had been slouched sideways with his feet dangling over the arm of the visitor’s chair while he waited for the district attorney to be ready to go out to lunch. “I’ve never known Greene or Donovan —let alone Forbes—to fall down on a simple assignment of this kind before,” he remarked; “yet the facts prove they’ve slipped somewhere. But I’m hanged if I can figure out where.”\n\nStephen pivoted about on the end of his spine until his feet came to rest upon the floor in front of him. “Just who are these chaps, Louie and Landis, Jeff?” he asked.\n\n“Counterfeiters,” the district attorney answered. “Lonesome Louie Madden pushes the stuff— gets it into circulation—and isn’t especially important. But Big Ben Landis is the brains of the gang; that’s why I want to use Louie to lead us to him. Naturally, the Federal men are working on the case, too; but they’re leaving this particular angle of it for my office to handle, and I’d like to show them we can make good. Only for some reason that’s a complete mystery to me, the best men on my staff seem unable to follow a trail that must be as broad as the back end of a Mack truck.”\n\n“Maybe Landis is passing the money along to Louie through some other member of the gang,” Stephen suggested.\n\nJeff shook his head. “Landis doesn’t operate that way,” he replied. “He claims that the middle man is the weakest point in a counterfeiting ring—which is pretty much the truth—so he doesn’t use one. He manufactures the stuff himself, from engraving the plates down to the actual printing, and doles it out to two or three legmen, who pass it on small purchases, and turn what they get in change back to him—less their commissions, of course. He never gives any of them more than a few hundred dollars at a time, for fear they may get ideas about skipping out and going into temporary business for themselves. That’s how I know he must be contacting Louie practically every other day or so. The thing that’s got me beat is, how does he do it?”\n\n“Could be he’s leaving the stuff somewhere for Louie to pick up,” Stephen offered. “Say a box in the railroad station, for instance.”\n\n“I’m afraid that’s out, too,” the district attorney said. “I’ve got the daily reports hare from Forbes, Donovan, and Greene ever since they’ve been on the case.” he gestured toward a manila folder of papers on the desk in front of biro, “and not one of them so much as mentions Louie’s having gone anywhere near a railroad station or any other place where he could pick up a package that might contain two or three hundred dollars in phony tens and twenties. All he does when he goes out is stroll about the center of town for an hour or so and make a few small purchases with his phony money. I can’t let it go on much longer; yet if I pick him up now, I’ll lose the only chance I may get to catch Landis.”\n\nMaybe Landis is wearing a disguise when they meet.”\n\nJeff smiled briefly, also ironically. “It would be easier to disguise a hippopotamus than Big Ben Landis,” be observed. “The man must ‘weigh over three hundred pounds. But let’s forget about him while we have lunch.” He reached for his own hat on the clothes tree in the corner, then tossed Stephen his. “I don’t want my appetite spoiled.”\n\nStephen caught the hat with one hand and placed it at a rakish angle upon his dark head. With the other hand, he picked up the folder of reports from his brother’s desk, and took it with him.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Little, Friendly Call On Louie\n\nLate in the afternoon, having a free hour or so, Stephen went over the reports carefully in the privacy of his own law office. He learned from them two things that he considered significant. The first was that every morning at exactly ten-thirty, Lonesome Louie left the cheap hotel where he was staying to go for a walk, during which he merely strolled aimlessly about for an hour or so, then returned to the hotel; the second was that he repeated this procedure every afternoon at exactly one-thirty. Stephen smiled with satisfaction at the reports. They had told him precisely what he wanted to know.\n\nThat evening during dinner, he brought up the subject of Lonesome Louie and Big Ben Landis. “What would you say, Jeff,” he began, “to my going along with Sergeant Forbes tomorrow morning when he goes on duty?”\n\nThe district attorney looked up suspiciously from his plate. “What for?” he demanded.\n\n“I think I know how we can make Lonesome Louie lead us to Big Ben Landis.”\n\nJeff snorted skeptically. “This isn’t a problem in deduction, Steve,” he pointed out. “It’s a matter of routine tailing that doesn’t call for any fancy mental gymnastics, but just for ordinary police training and practice; which Forbes has had, and you haven’t. If he hasn’t been able to spot the way Louie makes contact with Landis, how can you expect to do it?”\n\n“Still, I don’t guess it’d do any harm if I tried,” Stephen persisted.\n\nJeff was forced to concede the point.\n\nThe following morning Lonesome Louie was temporarily disconcerted upon descending from the unclean flea-bag that was his room, to find two tailers instead of the usual one waiting for him in the lobby of the hotel—especially when he recognized in the smaller of the two the younger brother of the district attorney. But his generally lugubrious countenance relaxed in a confident grin when, as he sallied forth, both Stephen and the big sergeant fell into step behind him in the usual way.\n\n“You see, Mr. Stephen,” Forbes said, discouraged, after they had played a kind of shadow tag with Louie for the better part of an hour, “he doesn’t meet anybody or do anything worth battin’ an eye at. He acts more like a man who’s just out to kill time.”\n\nStephen smiled in agreement.\n\n“Forbes, how right you are!” he murmured, but he didn’t sound in the least discouraged.\n\nLouie continued to lead them a merry, if somewhat leisurely, chase for another half hour, then he headed back to the hotel.\n\nThis time, instead of taking up their former position on the scuffed leather bench in the lobby facing the staircase and the perpetually out-of-order elevator, Stephen waited until the man they were tailing had disappeared from sight up the stairs; then he began to follow.\n\n“We’ll just pay a little, friendly call on Louie,” he remarked to the sergeant. “I’ve a notion this is his time to be receiving company, although I don’t guess he’ll be expecting us.”\n\nWhen they unceremoniously flung open the door to Louie’s room, the enormous fat man who was there with Louie sprang up with a violence that sent his chair crashing over backwards. His hand made a quick jab toward his hip pocket, but stopped midway when he saw the muzzle of Sergeant Forbe’s police automatic trained upon him.\n\n“Okay, Landis,” the sergeant said with grim satisfaction, “you can reach, but it’s not gonna be for anything you can touch.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Mountain\n\nBack in the district attorney’s office an hour or so later, Stephen lolled in the visitor’s chair and cocked one leg indolently over its arm. “It was all perfectly simple, Jeff,” he drawled. “I spotted it as soon as I read those reports, and noticed that Louie went for a walk every day at exactly the same time in the morning, and again in the afternoon. After he’d left the hotel —with Forbes or Donovan or Greene, as the case might be, following—Landis simply walked in and waited in his room for him to come back, when he gave Louie a fresh supply of the counterfeit money and collected his share of the real money Louie had got in change when he passed the phony bills. Then, when Louie went out for his afternoon walk, Landis left again. It was all perfectly safe and, as I said before, perfectly simple; so simple that I’d have spotted it even without reading the reports.”\n\n“That,” Jeff stated flatly; “I don’t believe.”\n\nStephen smiled with the bland ingenuousness that always set his older brother’s teeth on edge. “But it’s true, Jeff,” he protested. “If Louie wasn’t meeting Landis—and it was plain that he wasn’t, or Forbes or one of the other men you had tailing him would have spotted them—then the only other way for them to make contact was for Landis to meet him. You all made the quite natural mistake of expecting Mohammed to go to the mountain, whereas,” his smile became even more ingenuous, “this was one of the rare instances in which the mountain came to Mohammed.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Peg-Leg’s Victims\n  A Blood-Curdling Moan\n  Wonderly’s Diary\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nPeg-Leg’s Victims\n\nNewspaper readers will recall the series of brutal and seemingly senseless murders that occurred in England and were attributed to a criminal whom some clever writer dubbed Peg-Leg because after each of his appearances he left conclusive evidence in the form of footprints that he was minus his right leg and wore in its place an old-fashioned wooden affair ending in a round steel ferrule.\n\nI have said that these murders were seemingly senseless affairs, and that must have been the opinion of everyone who considered that they were committed without any apparent motive. From none of his victims was anything stolen and in the history of their lives there were no passages to denote the existence of an enemy who might kill in a spirit of revenge for a real or fancied grievance.\n\nThe first of these horrible crimes occurred in York. The victim was a certain John Elder, manufacturer of buttons, a highly respectable citizen.\n\nOn the night of his death, Elder had retired to his study to write some letters. As the evening was warm he had opened the French window, and according to the testimony of his butler who was the last of his household to see him alive, had dragged forward a small table and placed it just in the window’s opening. He had seated himself beside this table and begun to write when the servant left the room.\n\nAt about eleven o’clock this same servant had heard a cry coming from the study. He had hurried to see if anything were wrong with his master and had found him lying beside the table with a knife wound gaping in his chest. Outside the French window, the police had found unmistakable footprints of a one-legged man. These they followed across the lawn until they came to the road where they became blurred and finally lost in the medley of other prints on this much-traveled thorough fare.\n\nOf course the detectives rounded up every one-legged man in York and questioned them closely. But all had unquestionable alibis, and as the police were unable to discover or invent a means of tracing the criminal, they eventually dropped the case.\n\nPeg-Leg’s second victim was a little higher on the social scale. No lover of English sport will ever forget the name of Sir Roger Bascom. Nor will the many unfortunate souls whom he helped in their need be more backward in cherishing his memory. As in the case of John Elder, Bascom was killed between the hours of eleven and midnight.\n\nAnd on the grounds of his estate in Sussex were found another series of the footprints of a one-legged man. Because of his prominence, the police put forth their best efforts to run down his murderer. But these went as unrewarded as had those of their colleagues in York.\n\nThese two murders happened within three months of each other. Then for over a year Peg-Leg was not heard from again. His next appearance was in London where on Hempstead Heath he stabbed Professor Thomas Belding, the noted authority on Eastern religions.\n\nNow I come to the last of Peg-Leg’s activities. His final murder occurred here in Camberwell and robbed une of one of my dearest friends.\n\nThe Reverend Frank Parkington was a bachelor, and with young Harry Fellows, his curate, lived in the old stone Vicarage just behind the church of St. Annes. He was in all particulars the finest man I have ever known, a brilliant preacher, a good friend, an ardent worker in his chosen field.\n\nHis home was a rendezvous for a few of us who over a convivial pipe liked to discuss those matters of the day that interested us. On the night of his death we had gathered at his request to meet Captain Charles Wonderly, the Indian explorer who was his guest.\n\nWe found this fellow Wonderly a very interesting talker. He had traveled far and seen much and knew how to picture in words what he had seen. With his descriptions and anecdotes he held us interested until well toward midnight.\n\nI remember that I arrived home at about twelve-fifteen. I retired immediately. But I did not go to sleep at once as my mind was still full of the Captain Wonderly’s stories. Just as I was dozing off I heard the church clock strike two and at the same instant there came a violent ringing at my door-bell.\n\nI found Harry Fellows awaiting me on my door-step.\n\n“Come! Come quickly!” he said in a voice hoarse from excitement. “Dr. Parkington is dead—murdered!”\n\n“Murdered! Good heavens, man, are you mad!” I shouted, staring into his face that showed pale and haggard in the feeble light of my hall lamp.\n\nFor answer he reached out and shook me roughly by the shoulder.\n\n“Will you come,” he said fiercely, “or shall I have to carry you?”\n\nHad I not immediately shown signs of obeying his demand, I really believe the young giant would have picked me up and carried me just as I was in pajamas and slippers. His love for Parkington who had been more than a father to him was a strong thing, and at that moment his grief made him less than reasonable.\n\nIn less than ten minutes we were on the road to the vicarage. As we hurried through the still night. Fellows briefly told me what had happened.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Blood-Curdling Moan\n\nAfter his guests had left, Parkington and Captain Wonderly, who was staying for the night, went to their rooms. Because he had some work to finish, Fellows had remained down stairs. At about one-fifteen he was just finishing his writing when he was startled and frightened by the sound of a blood-curdling moan followed by the sound of someone choking.\n\nAs soon as he had pulled himself together, he ran upstairs and instinct guided him to Parkington’s room. He knocked at the door and when there was no answer he pushed it open and entered the bedroom.\n\nThere on his knees beside the bed he found Parkington dead. A knife or some long, sharp instrument had been driven into his back.\n\n“What did you do then?” I asked.\n\n“Called Rodgers, the servant, and sent him off for the police.”\n\n“You didn’t rouse Wonderly?”\n\n“No. In the excitement I forgot all about the fellow.”\n\nWe entered the vicarage and raced up the stairs to Parkington’s room. There we found Chief Constable Smithers in charge, and with him a quiet looking man whom he introduced as Inspector Grant of Scotland Yard, “down for a bit of a holiday, sir, and stopping with me.”\n\nBut for the moment I paid but little attention to Smithers and his friend. I was too greatly upset by the sight of the body I could make out lying beside the bed. My natural sorrow at Parkington’s death was added to by the awfulness of the way in which he had been taken from us. I went over and stood beside his body and looking down on it swore that I would find his murderer and see that he paid for his crime.\n\nThen I turned to Smithers for his report.\n\n“Squire,” he began gravely, “what I have to tell you will probably surprise you. You have heard of the notorious Peg-Leg. Well, sir, there is every indication that this is another of his fiendish crimes.”\n\nBoth Fellows and myself stared in amazement. Smithers continued.\n\n“Yes, sir, I know that it sounds impossible but nevertheless it seems to be a fact. Inspector Grant here who worked on both the Bascom case and that of Professor Belding, will bear me out when I say that all the clues we have been able to find point in that direction.”\n\nInspector Grant nodded his head. Smithers crossed the room and stood midway between the bed and an open window that looked out on poor Parkington’s lawn.\n\nHe pointed downward at the carpet.\n\n“See here, sir. Those little round marks—and here—and here—leading right to the window, sir. And plenty more of them on the ground below accompanied by the print of one shoe which does not show on this carpet.”\n\n“And those marks—” I began.\n\n“They’re from a wooden leg,” Smithers finished.\n\n“But see here,” Fellows cried from beside the window. “How did the beggar get in the house. No man with a wooden leg could climb up here.”\n\nSmithers shook his head.\n\n“No good, sir. It’s really a very easy job. You have the hooks that hold the drain pipe all the way. Both Grant and I tried it and had no trouble at all.”\n\n“Have you tried to follow the trail?” I asked.\n\n“Lor’ bless you, yes, sir. We did that at once. But it leads nowhere. The prints are lost on the stone road less than a hundred feet down the highway.”\n\nWe were all bending over those horrible indentations in the carpet when a sound at our backs caused us to look up. In the doorway clad in his pajamas was Captain Wonderly rubbing his eyes and yawning.\n\n“I say, you chaps,” he said, “what’s up?”\n\nThen he caught sight of Parkington’s body and started forward.\n\n“Good heavens! Parkington!” he exclaimed. “What’s wrong with him? Is he hurt?”\n\n“Dead,” I answered briefly.\n\nIn a dazed sort of way Wonderly turned his eyes from one to another of us. At last they rested on Smithers, and guided by the constable’s uniform, addressed him as the officer of the law.\n\n“Have you got the man that did this?”\n\n“Not yet,” Smithers replied. “And now, sir. I’ll trouble you to tell me who you are and what you know of this business.”\n\nWonderly indicated Fellows and me.\n\n“These gentlemen know me,” he said. “My name’s Wonderly. I was a friend of Dr. Parkington. As for what I know of this business—unfortunately I can’t help you a bit.”\n\n“You were staying in the house?” Wonderly looked down significantly at his night clothes.\n\n“I certainly was,” he answered, “in that room across the hall.”\n\n“And you heard nothing? No sound?”\n\nAn expression of sorrow—almost of shame passed over Wonderly’s face.\n\n“If I only had,” he replied quietly, “I’ll wager Parkington would be alive now. You see, gentlemen, some years ago I lost the hearing in my right ear. This deficiency doesn’t bother me ordinarily but if I happen to go to sleep on my left ear as I did tonight, I’m as deaf as a post.”\n\nAt my suggestion we went downstairs and seated ourselves in the library, leaving the murder chamber and its ghastly inhabitant untouched to await the offices of the coroner. But hardly had we taken our chairs when Fellows jumped to his feet, exclaiming: “This sitting around when Dr. Parkington’s murderer is making good his escape is too much for me. I’m going to have a look around.”\n\nI put out my hand to stop him but at a signal from Smithers let it fall.\n\n“Let him go,” he said after Fellows had left the room. “It won&#39;t do any good but it won’t do any harm and it may ease the poor lad to be doing something.”\n\n“Of course you have sent out a general alarm,” I asked Smithers a minute later.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“Of course, sir. Any one-legged man seen hereabouts will find his way to the police station.”\n\nThen we began a careful consideration of the crime, each man suggesting that which he thought might help toward clearing it up and bringing the criminal to justice.\n\nIn this consultation, I conceived a great admiration for Captain Wonderly. The man had an exceedingly keen mind. In competition with Smithers and Inspector Grant, both old hands in the pursuit of criminals, he showed up wonderfully. No point escaped him and several times he set the others right in the development of a theory or in the statement of facts. Then and there, I said to myself, that could I persuade Wonderly to give up his time to seeking the murderer of my friend, I might hope for some results.\n\nI was about to put the suggestion to him when we were all startled by the sound of quick footsteps on the stairs and along the hall. An instant later the library door swung wide and the huge bulk of Fellows filled the aperture.\n\nI caught my breath in amazement as I saw the expression on his face. His eyes were wild with excitement and about his lips were lines of grim determination.\n\nWithout a word to the detectives or me, he crossed the room to Wonderly and bending over him whispered in his right ear.\n\nA look of utter amazement came into Wonderer’s eyes. This was quickly followed by fear which in turn changed to a sort of blind rage. He strove to rise, but Fellows’s hand was about his throat and held him tightly to his chair.\n\nThen very slowly, Fellows brought his other hand from behind his back. In it was a long knife and some queer contrivance whose purpose I could not make out. He threw these things on the table in front of Wonderly.\n\n“Smithers,” he said in a cold, hard voice, “I want you to arrest this man for the murder of John Elder, Sir Roger Bascom, Professor Belding and Dr. Parkington.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nWonderly’s Diary\n\nWhat happened then happened so quickly that we others had not the time to pull ourselves together and go to Fellows’s aid. There was a brief struggle between Fellows and Wonderly, a cry from the latter, the tinkle of broken glass on the floor and then suddenly Wonderly’s body went limp in Fellows’s hands.\n\n“Poison,” Fellows muttered, bending over the body of his late antagonist. “The beggar had it in the pocket of his dressing-gown.”\n\nHe picked up a rug from the floor and threw it over the body in front of him.\n\nNow we all crowded around Fellows and burst into a babel of questions. He raised one hand to silence us and with the other pointed at the queer contrivance which with the knife lay in front of Wonderly’s corpse.\n\n“There,” he said, “is the wooden leg of your Peg-Leg.”\n\nThe thing was a piece of board cut in the shape of the sole of a shoe. From the bottom projected a short, round stick tipped with an iron ferrule. At the front and back were straps by which it might be fastened to a man’s foot. Only a brief examination of it was needed to see how once so fastened the prints the wearer would leave behind him would certainly resemble those of a one-legged man.\n\nSmithers was the first to break the silence.\n\n“Mr. Fellows,” he said, “I must congratulate you. You have laid by the heels a man whom the best detectives in England couldn’t catch. But I beg of you, sir, tell us how you did it.”\n\nFellows sank into a chair.\n\n“All right,” he said, “it must be sometime and I suppose it might as well be now.”\n\nHe drew a square, leather-bound book from his pocket.\n\n“But first,” he went on, “I want you to listen to a few extracts from Wonderly’s diary. They will throw some light on the man’s motives for his dastardly crimes.”\n\nThen in a low voice he read us the following:\n\n\n  Calcutta, November 16—Civilization again! After five years of freedom to be cooped up in this place of narrow streets and silly houses! But if it is my destiny to carry on the war among men of my own race, I must not begin by complaining.\n\n  I see none but strange faces on the streets and in the clubs. Thanks to the gods, the men who knew me have gone their ways. The fools! They despised me because my eyes sought the Light. And when, having found it, I followed it, they said that I had gone fantee.\n\n  How I could laugh at them now. The pretentious asses with their weak, anaemic gods, thinking they know the secrets of life. I who have stood before the altar of Siva and watched the spilling of the blood; I who have harkened to the angry voice of Kali, would bid them halt and reconsider their conceit lest the vengeance that is Asia’s descend upon them.\n\n  ****\n\n  London—The message came today, and it is to kill—kill—Kill!\n\n  ****\n\n  My birthday, and I have begun the great work. John Elder is dead. Even now the police are searching for the one-legged man who killed him. One-legged! I wonder if the fools will ever see through my little scheme for sending them hunting the wild goose.\n\n  ****\n\n  The good work continues. Bascom and Belding are gone the way of Elder. So may all men go who lift their hands against the holy gods!\n\n\nFellows closed the book and threw it aside.\n\n“A mad man!” I whispered.\n\n“A religious fanatic of the worst type,” Fellows answered. “I think I can piece his story together. He became enamored with native life and probably fell into the hands of the priests. Or perhaps a woman led him to the native shrines. And their damnable religion got into his blood and drove him mad.”\n\nSmithers scratched his head.\n\n“But what made him kill?”\n\n“Because his victims were the enemies of his religion. All four of them knew the evil practices of his cult; knew how his priests were holding back the people of India. With their best efforts and their money, here in England, they were fighting the battles of their dark-skinned brothers thousands of miles away.”\n\n“Now will you tell us how you found this fellow out?”\n\nThe question came from Inspector Grant. Fellows nodded and began.\n\n“There was one thing that bothered me from the time Wonderly entered the room upstairs. And that was his explanation for not hearing Parkington’s cry and the ensuing commotion which I and the rest of us must have made.\n\n“You remember he said that he was totally deaf in the right ear. That would have been all right had I not happened to remember that I sat on his right side at dinner tonight and once spoke to him in a voice barely above a whisper in his right ear. And he heard perfectly.\n\n“My first idea was that the man was a coward and had stayed in his room because he had been afraid to come out and see what all the noise was about. I held to that opinion until we had come downstairs and I left you to wander about the garden.\n\n“When I went outside, my first impulse was to take a lantern and examine the famous foot-prints. I did so and traced them as you did down to the stone road. Then I came back to the house and began to wander aimlessly about the other side of it.\n\n“I ended up a few yards away from Wonderly’s window. Happening to glance downward, I saw something that sent the blood racing through my veins. There on the ground before me in a soft spot on the gravel were another set of foot-prints. And these were of a man with two legs wearing shoes that seemed to correspond to the single shoe worn by the man .with one leg.\n\n“I raced around to the other side of the house and verified my suspicion. Then I went back to my find.\n\n“I took the direction the prints pointed out and followed it slowly, my lantern close to the ground. A ways farther on I found another set of prints and so on every little while I found them until I had made a wide detour and was out on the stone road where the murderer’s prints began, and ended.\n\n“At first I did not realize the significance of what I had discovered. Then it suddenly came to me that a man could easily leave the foot-prints of a one-legged man if in walking he used a stilt or some such device. Also I recalled that the new prints had begun at Wonderley’s window. Then I knew why he hadn’t joined us in Parkington’s room sooner. It was because he was probably in hiding somewhere at the other side of the house waiting for a chance to slip back into his room after having murdered my friend and left those bewildering prints.\n\n“I came back to the house, crept upstairs and went through his things. You know what I found and what happened after that.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

He sat up in bed, stiff, tense, listening for it again. And then, suddenly, a cold chill swept over him as he heard again, this time unmistaken, the three knocks at the front door.\n\nHis wife, Myra, grabbed his arm.\n\n“Don’t answer it, Jim. Maybe, they’ll go away.”\n\nThe room became suddenly blue-white as lightning fired the darkness. For an instant, he saw his wife’s face, pale and frightened and old.\n\n“Got to answer it, Myra. Might be someone pretty sick. Can’t tell.”\n\nAgain, the thunder rumbled and again—three knocks.\n\nWearily, Old Doc Welch stepped into a pair of slippers, threw a robe over his shoulders. His back ached and he wondered why he hadn’t become a lawyer or a plumber, instead of a country doctor. He stumbled past the waiting room to the front door, listened once more to the three knocks.\n\n“All right, all right. I’m coming. Hold your dang-blasted horses!”\n\nHe switched on a small wall-lamp, opened the door.\n\nShivering, cold rain lashing his face and body, Doc Welch stared at the two men in the doorway.\n\n“Doc Welch?” It was the tall, shifty-eyed one who spoke.\n\n“That’s right.” He opened the door a little wider.\n\n“We got a little job for you, Doc. Little surgery.”\n\n“Sorry, I’m no surgeon. Broken bones, belly aches and babies. You fellows ought to see Doc Benjamin in town. He’s a surgeon.” He ran his hands through greying hair, started to close the door.\n\n“You’re a surgeon now, Doc.”\n\nDoc Welch saw the gun, then. A .38 was clutched in the man’s hand, it’s shiny, blue barrel only a few inches from Doc Welch’s stomach. They forced the door open.\n\n“Behave like a good, little doctor and nothing’ll happen to you. Get smart and we’ll blast you. Okay, Felix, go get the patient.” Felix, the short one, disappeared to a car outside.\n\nDoc Welch backed up in the dim light of the hallway, studied the tall man, his eyes never for a second leaving the leveled .38.\n\nSure, why hadn’t he become a plumber? Plumbers were never wakened up at three in the morning to have a gun poked in their belly. All they had to worry about was pipes.\n\nDoc Welch turned then to see Felix and the “patient” in the doorway. Felix paused long enough to catch his breath, then he locked both arms around the “patient’s” chest.\n\nGrunting, his face red, he struggled and dragged the apparently unconscious patient into the hallway. Behind them, on the flowered carpet, lay a trail of rain and blood. The tall one slammed the door, never lowering the .38.\n\n“Okay, Doc, take us to surgery. And no funny business.”\n\n“You fellows won’t get away with this.”\n\n“No sermons, Doc. Move!”\n\nHe hesitated, then seeing no choice, moved toward the white-paneled door. He opened the door and they were swiftly blanketed in darkness and the heavy scent of ether. That was when he got the idea.\n\n“C’mon, Doc, put on a light.”\n\n“Wait’ll I find the switch, will you.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Fear-Crazed Look\n\nHe started toward the cabinets at the far end of the room. There was a jug of concentrated ammonia in one cabinet and if he could get his hands on it before the lights went on, throw it in their faces, it would blind them and choke them for a few seconds and a few seconds was all he wanted.\n\nHe would soon find something else to throw, a chair, more jugs and bottles, and somehow he’d get a hold of that gun. He’d show them that being old and fat with kind, blue eyes didn’t make you necessarily harmless.\n\nSlowly, almost on tip-toes, he reached the cabinet. He reached down in the darkness, gripped the jug, started to unscrew the cap.\n\nSuddenly, the stillness was broken by a muffled scream. He whirled, saw Myra silhouetted in the doorway.\n\n“Okay, lady, stand where you are. C’mon, Doc, get that light on.”\n\nThere was no use to play it brave now. He didn’t want Myra stopping any bullets. Do what they said. At least he’d live—maybe. He cursed, angry that Myra had stumbled onto the scene, then switched on the light.\n\n“All right, lady, get over there with the Doc.”\n\nShe saw the gun, flashed a fear-crazed look at her husband.\n\n“C’mon, move!”\n\n“Better do what he says, Myra.”\n\nShe moved toward him in short, quick steps. He put his arm around her. Felix and the other man dragged their still unconscious friend to a table in the center of the room, lifted him onto it.\n\n“All right, Doc, operate.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Little Stomach Trouble\n\nHe shot a glance at his wife, saw the tears, the tremor of her lips, patted her gently, then moved reluctantly toward the table. He made a visual examination of the man on the table and in just a few seconds, he knew.\n\n“Looks like you’re a little late, boys. Your pal is dead.”\n\n“Now ain’t that something,” the tall one said. His dark eyes blazed. “Operate, Doc.”\n\n“Operate? For what? I told you this man is dead.”\n\n“Do like I tell you, Doc. Open him up.”\n\nThe Doc looked up, puzzled, saw the strange, twisted grin on the tall man’s face. Were these men crazy?\n\n“Maybe, you better explain to the Doc, Felix. Let him know what he has to do.”\n\nThe short man moved closer, waved his own gun at the dead man.\n\n“Seems our friend had a little stomach trouble, Doc. He swallowed some diamonds he shouldn’t have.”\n\nDoc Welch still didn’t get it.\n\n“He was going to take a little trip below the border — and with all them gems in his belly, too. Only we got a slug in his back and talked him out of it. Now open him up, Doc. They’re coated with plastic. You can’t miss them.”\n\nSuddenly, everything became clear to Doc Welch. He’d been in town that afternoon, stopped in the Waffle Shop for a cup of coffee, and there had run into the sheriff having a dish of his favorites. It had passed over his head at the time, but now he remembered.\n\nThe sheriff had spoken of a big jewelry store stick-up. He’d said three men—$30,000 worth of diamonds. Then these were the same men the whole state was looking for.\n\nHe turned now, stared at the dead man. And this guy on the table had apparently tried to outwit the other two. He had coated the diamonds with some kind of plastic material, swallowed them one by one, hoping to escape by himself to Mexico.\n\nUnfortunately for him, his pals had got wise and killed him.\n\n“Okay, Doc, we ain’t got all night. Snap it up!”\n\n“Suppose I refuse?”\n\n“Suppose you don’t.” The tall one’s teeth were bared in a murderous smile, as he waved the gun in the direction of the Doc’s wife.\n\nFrom a rack, he removed a white laboratory coat. At the table, he cut away the man’s shirt and undershirt, lowered his trousers, then covered him with a sheet. The two men backed over against the wall. The Doc could see they wouldn’t like this. He forced a pair of rubber gloves onto his hands, then went to the cabinet near the sink and removed what instruments he would need.\n\nPaused over the corpse, the shiny, stainless-steel scalpel in hand, he took a last look at the two men standing in the shadows against the wall.\n\n“Cut, Doc.”\n\nDoc Welch began.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Load Of Hot Gallstones\n\nA clock hung next to the linen cabinet. It ticked away five, ten, fifteen minutes … and then, Doc Welch looked up. He couldn’t help feeling a sort of grim, professional satisfaction at a job well done. The incision had been made and he had found what he was looking for.\n\n“Doc, I got itchy fingers. Start picking them pellets out … and hurry!”\n\nWith forceps and tweezers, the Doc began to remove the wet pellets. He laid them carefully in a large patch of gauze.\n\nTen minutes later he removed the last pellet, stared at between fifteen and twenty pellets lying in the gauze.\n\n“That’s all of ’em.”\n\n“All right, Doc, now you can take that plastic coating off the diamonds.”\n\nFor a long minute the Doc stood silent.\n\n“You’ll need some kind of a corrosive agent to take that plastic stuff off. Lye’ll do.”\n\nThen he stopped.\n\n“Only I don’t have any.”\n\nTheir eyes shifted.\n\n“Heck, you can buy it in any grocery store.”\n\n“Then what?”\n\n“Well, put the diamonds in a pan of lye and boil ’em for about five minutes. That should take it off and it won’t hurt the diamonds.”\n\nThe two men avoided the corpse on the table. The tall one grinned victoriously and scooped the gauze into a bundle, stuffed the bundle into his coat pocket. Then he turned to the old doctor.\n\n“You did good, Doc, and just to show you how much we appreciate it—”\n\nThe butt of the gun came sudden like a whip, smashed against the Doc’s mouth, sent him sprawling to the floor. Myra screamed and ran to him.\n\n“See you, Doc.” The tall one laughed, slapped at the gauze bundle in his pocket. “Wonderful surgeon, that Doc.” They were both laughing throatily as they left.\n\nDoc Welch didn’t speak until he heard their car grinding up the country lane. Then he turned his head, looked up at Myra. A slow, trickle of blood oozed from his pain-throbbed lips. Yet he smiled, and the smile became a laugh.\n\n“You know, Myra, I’d give a hundred dollars to see the look on them gunmen’s faces when they try to peddle a load of hot gallstones. Go call up the sheriff.”\n\n“What do you mean?” She was blinking fast.\n\n“Why that fella there on the table had enough gallstones in his bladder to anchor a river boat. I just substituted the gallstones for the real pellets. Well, quit staring at me that way. Call the sheriff. Tell him we got every last one of them diamonds, and then put on some waffles. The sheriff is crazy about waffles.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

I’ll Kill You!\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nFirst Farmers Bank\n\nThe long, sleek limousine rolled slowly to a halt in front of the First Farmers Bank of New Albany, Indiana. The liveried negro chauffeur started to turn off the ignition when a sharp, thin voice from the rear seat froze his hand.\n\n“Leave her running, George.”\n\n“Y-yes, suh!”\n\n“Get out and go into the bank—slowly! I’ll be right in back of you. Understand?”\n\n“Yes, suh. I—I understand.” George’s face was a little pale as he got out of the car and walked slowly, as directed, through the door of the bank. Though there was a cool breeze, sweat beaded his forehead.\n\nBehind him the expensive car disgorged incongruously a stocky kid, not over sixteen, his cheap checked suit tightly buttoned and his cap peaked down to shade his face. Both his hands dug deep in the pockets of his coat.\n\nThere were few passersby on Main Street that afternoon in 1948, and they paid no attention to the chauffeur or the youth who followed him. Within the bank, the tellers were beginning to lounge. It was near closing time. The bank guard leaned his elbow contemplatively on the grilled window behind which Henry Green was counting his money. Mr. Smythe, gray-haired president of the bank, placed a paperweight carefully on the report he had been reading, and got up from behind his desk. He had an appointment to play golf.\n\nHorton, the guard, turned as he heard the bank door open. George, the chauffeur, entered.\n\n“Hello, George,” grinned Horton. “You almost didn’t make it; bank’s getting ready to close.” Everyone knew George. He chauffeured for Mr. Jones, owner of the big steel mill over in Louisville, just across the river.\n\nBut George didn’t answer with his usual ready smile. His face was rigid, imploring; he moved forward stiffly as though propelled irresistibly from behind.\n\n“What’s wrong?” demanded the guard in surprise. Then: “Hey!”\n\nThe stocky kid had swung suddenly into view. The cap was low over his eyes. A gun thrust forward in his hand. “Up with your hands, you blankety-blank so-and-so!” he said in a high, bleak voice. “If you make a move, I’ll drill you, so help me.”\n\nHorton’s fingers dropped away from his holster; his arms lifted slowly.\n\n“And the rest of you,” snarled the kid. “Stand still and shut up. Where’s Smythe, the president of this bank?”\n\nMr. Smythe stood at his desk. He held himself carefully. “I’m Mr. Smythe,” he said; “if you think you can hold up this bank you’re—”\n\n“Shut up! Turn around and open that safe in back of you.”\n\n“Look here, you can’t—”\n\n“Open that safe.”\n\nSmythe braced himself. “I won’t,” he said.\n\nThe kid fired. Sharp sound filled the bank. Smythe jerked forward, staggered and fell headlong.\n\nHorton gasped, dropped his right arm swiftly in a desperate attempt for his gun. The kid swerved; sound again blasted the walls. The guard’s fingers uncurled, and the half-drawn gun dropped with a clatter to the floor. He followed it, shuddered and lay still.\n\nBut even as the reverberation of gunfire echoed from the marble, a new sound blasted with insistent clamor. The urgent shout of the alarm bell.\n\nThe kid shoved his gun at the frightened teller. “You lousy son,” he screamed. “You asked for it.” A single shot pierced the stridency of the alarm. Henry Green, his foot still on the buzzer, crumpled out of sight.\n\nThe kid backed toward the door, the smoking pistol covering his retreat. “You!” he stabbed at George. “Get the hell out there into the car. And no funny work. Understand?”\n\n“I—I understand.” Ashen-faced, the breath sobbing in his lungs, the chauffeur stumbled out into the light.\n\nThe gunman waited until he heard him open the car door. Then he spun around, raced for the limousine, flung himself into the back seat “Drive like hell! I’ll tell you where to go.”\n\nBehind him was a shambles: three dead men, panic and the senseless clangor of the alarm.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nWe Gotta Get The Facts, Sister\n\nAl Aronson, ace reporter of the Louisville Courier-Journal, bent over the dying man. It was hard to hear his words. His chest swathed in bandages to hide the gaping wound and keep the ebbing life within a little longer, rose and fell in labored spasms.\n\nThe hospital nurse said: “You two will have to be brief; talking isn’t good for him.”\n\nLt. Dave Hunt of the New Albany police said gruffly: “We gotta get the facts, sister. Go ahead, Al. See if you can make out what he’s saying.”\n\nAl bent even closer. His voice was gentle, sympathetic. “This is tough on you, George, but it’s important. Do you think you’ll be able to tell me the story?”\n\nThe wounded man opened his eyes, tried to gather his strength. “I’ve got to, Mr. Aronson,” he whispered. “The killer—he’s only a kid—but he’s killed four men and—”\n\n“Three, George.”\n\nA sad smile flitted over the Negro’s drawn face. “Four, Mr. Aronson,” he corrected. “I know I’m through. But—I was waiting over in Louisville to pick up my boss when this kid puts a gun to me, an’ makes me drive him over the bridge to New Albany. When we came to the bank—”\n\nA shudder coursed through the dying man. He shut his eyes.\n\n“Save your strength,” said Aronson. “We know that part; what happened after?”\n\n“That kid was mad—mean mad when we got back in the car. I’ve heard cursing before, but never like that. He was filthy-mouthed. Cursed the men he’d killed, cursed the alarm system, cursed me. And in between curses he kept directing me—turn down First Street, then into Cranberry, left on Lake.”\n\nAronson nodded. “Knew the town, eh, George?”\n\n“Yes, suh. He sure did. I was scared silly, but I tried ta fool him. Kept making mistakes, twisted wrong, tried to get him in front of the police station. I expected to smash the car and yell for help, but—”\n\n“He knew better,” Aronson interjected softly.\n\nGeorge stared up at the reporter, his face sweating with the memory.\n\n“Knew every twist an’ turn like he’d lived here all his life. Pushed his gun in my back, swore he’d blow me ta hell. Landed me in an alley on the riverfront where no one was. Got out, turned, pointed that gun at me, said with a nasty grin: ‘Only one way ta keep your mouth shut,’ and pulled the trigger. Next thing I know, I’m here and—”\n\nHe was going to die. George knew it as well as Al Aronson, Lt. Hunt, the nurse, the doctors, and everybody.\n\nPoor fellow, thought Aronson. No use trying to tell him he’s going to be better.\n\nAloud he said: “What did he look like, George?”\n\n“A heavy, tough kid — ‘bout seventeen, I’d say — and ‘bout five eight or nine. Wore a checked, tight suit o’ that loud green, and a cap. Couldn’t see much of his face; had his cap down too far; but he was full o’ pimples. Had a tough kid’s voice; the filthiest I ever did hear.”\n\nAronson straightened wearily. “That’s fine, George. Now, unless Lt. Hunt wants to ask you some more, just relax.”\n\nHunt set his jaw. “Just a couple o’ questions, George. In the first place—”\n\nThe chauffeur seemed to slump underneath the bedclothes. His eyes were fixed on Hunt, but they were blank.\n\n“Save your question, Hunt,” said Aronson. “George will never answer it.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nHunches\n\nLt. Hunt chewed angrily on his cigar. “Stop trying to ride me, Aronson,” he exploded. “I’m telling you for the last time that killer was no local kid. I know every last hoodlum in town, and this punk doesn’t fit in. He’s an outsider.”\n\nAronson leaned forward earnestly. “But,” he protested, “you heard George say that kid knew the back alleys here better than he did.”\n\n“So what? He could of come here a day before and studied the place. Why, for instance, would a local boy have to go over to Louisville to grab a car and bring it all the way here? Does that make sense?”\n\n“It does sound screwy.” Aronson admitted.\n\n“Okay, then. And don’t you go writing articles in your paper to the contrary, if you want the run of this place, either.”\n\nAl Aronson was riding his hunches, and the hunch of George, the dead chauffeur.\n\nGeorge had been sure the killer was a local boy. Yet Hunt was a damned good cop, and if he said that there wasn’t a hoodlum in New Albany who fit the description he was probably right.\n\n\n\nAl Aronson disconsolately got into his car. He’d have to get back to the paper and write a story. Except it won’t be a story, he thought disgustedly. It’ll be a rehash:\n\nKILLER STILL ON THE LOOSE. NO CLUES.\n\nThe newspaperman in him revolted at the thought of dishing out yesterday’s warmed-over news.\n\nThen an idea hit him! He heeled the car around in a screaming U-turn and went racing back to New Albany. He had an angle—not a very convincing one yet—but at least it explained how Lt. Hunt and the chauffeur could both be right. Maybe the kid had once lived in town, but had moved.\n\nPulling up at the first gas station, Aronson went into a huddle with a telephone book, and came out with the names and addresses of the six moving companies in town.\n\nHe started making the rounds, interviewing the driver of every moving van. They listened to his description; then shook their heads. “Sorry, Buddy. If I ever saw him, I don’t remember.”\n\nAronson began to feel his job was futile. There was so little to go on. But he wouldn’t give up. Then—he struck pay dirt!\n\nA mover named Davis said, “A mean kid, dark haired, pimples? A real low-down mean kid? Yeah, I remember him, all right; I’ll never forget the dirty little rat.”\n\n“When did you move him?” Al asked.\n\n“Must have been about a year ago. But I remember him good. Frankie Benson was his moniker. I moved him and his old man. The kid said he’d help me with a crate—a big crate—kind of a piano crate, but no piano in it. When we had it up, he let go his end. Near busted my back. He started cussing me. Filthiest mouth I ever heard. I grabbed the punk and almost slugged him. Then I remembered he was just a kid, so I let him go. And when I turned around, he threw a hammer at me. Lucky his aim wasn’t too good. It missed my head, but near tore off my ear; here, I’ll show you the scar. They had to put three stitches in it, I woulda torn him apart if I got my hands on him, but he ran away, and I never saw him again.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nBut What Could I Do?\n\nThree hours later Al Aronson made his way down a dirty, ramshackle street in Louisville, to the address Davis had given him. He surveyed the paint-peeled, two room structure in the small, littered yard.\n\nI should have gotten Hunt to come along, he thought. Wish I at least had a gun with me. Well, here goes.\n\nHe crossed the street, now growing dark, and peered into the unlit front room. No one there. He made his way to the back of the house. Through a rear window he saw a stoop-shouldered, gray-haired man puttering around a stove. Apparently Frankie wasn’t at home.\n\nAronson knocked on the door and introduced himself to Mr. Benson. He started telling the story, just the way it happened, carefully watching the old man’s face. Before the reporter was halfway through, the man suddenly burst out, “Don’t tell me no more; I don’t want to hear it It’s him, all right. I knew something like this would happen. Four men killed! Oh, my God! It’s my fault, I guess. He was bad all the way through, but what could I do?” The man’s voice was taking on a hysterical note.\n\nThe newspaperman helped the shaking old man to a chair; tried to quiet him. “All right, Mr. Benson, why don’t you tell me the whole thing?”\n\nAnd then the floodgates opened. Benson poured out his story in a rush of words, as though something stored within him for years had now reached the bursting point.\n\nIt wasn’t a particularly new story—not much different from dozens Aronson had written about— except its fateful climax. It was the story of a kid reared in the slums— a mother who died when the child was very young, and who hadn’t cared what happened to him before that.\n\nA father who worked out of town, and saw him only a couple of hours on weekends. Frankie Benson had lived in the streets, almost like a wild animal, prowling back alleys for food, hanging around pool halls, bullying the smaller animals of the jungle he lived in and running from the larger ones; rejected and scorned by the decent elements of society, and nursing an ever-growing hatred. He had stolen, gone to reform school, and come out all the worse.\n\n“At first I thought he was just wild, like kids get sometimes,” the old man said hoarsely. “But then, when he was only thirteen, he started stealing. That’s when I knew he was bad. And I knew then that he’d end up rotten, that something like this would happen.”\n\nCondemned at thirteen. Al thought bitterly. The kid never had a chance!\n\nHis mind flashed back on his own boyhood. Thirteen—that was the year he was confirmed. He recalled that day in the synagogue— the joy and the warmth of it, surrounded by loving parents, relatives, friends, teachers.\n\nA kid needs people to love him, he said to himself. People rooting for him. Frankie never had anybody on his side.\n\n“He used to hit me,” Benson went on in a voice that was now half sobbing. “His own father. I was afraid even to talk to him. I’d ask him to do something, he’d knock me down. Once when he was out in the box I yelled for him to come in to eat. He nearly choked me to death — said he’d kill me if I ever bothered him when he was busy with the box.”\n\nAronson leaned over and said softly, “What box, Mr. Benson?”\n\n“It was a piano crate, I don’t know where he got it; he brought it home one day, years ago. He fixed it up and would stay in it. Sometimes almost a whole day. Like he was hiding from the world. It used to be sort of a game, I think — like most kids would use a tent. But then he’d shut himself in and hide. I don’t know from what.”\n\n“Where’s the box now?”\n\n“I shipped it out, like he told me.”\n\nAronson leaned forward. “When did he tell you? When did you ship it? Where did you ship it?”\n\nThe old man thought for a moment. “Day before yesterday. That musta been the day those men were killed. He gave me some money, and said I should ship the crate to Knoxville. No address, just Railway Express, in Knoxville. He said I’d better do it the next day, or he’d take care of me. So that’s what I did. I sent it to Knoxville.”\n\n“Have you seen Frankie since?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Do you have a receipt for the box?”\n\n“Yes. I’ll get it.” Benson reached into a drawer in the kitchen table, brought out a couple of scraps of paper. He gave the receipt to Aronson, and then stood studying a dirty piece of notepaper in his hand. “I found this on the table that night, after he told me about sending the box. I—I didn’t know what he meant then.”\n\nAronson took the note from his fingers, and read the child-like scrawl. Stop me, please, before I do it again.\n\nThe old man looked entreatingly at the reporter. “Before he does it again! Oh, stop him! Stop him!”\n\nAronson’s lips tightened. He took the receipt and headed for the door. “I’ll try.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nI’ll Kill You! I’ll Kill You!\n\nIn the quiet of the darkened warehouse, Lt. Hunt flashed his light along the rows of high-piled crates, trunks and boxes.\n\n“I must be crazy,” he said to Al Aronson, “letting you drag me out of bed to chase an old piano crate down to Knoxville. It would be different if he had gotten away with the bank robbery—maybe he’d have the dough in the crate. But he didn’t get a dime. We could have had the Knoxville police pick him up whenever he calls for the box. I don’t know what you expect to find inside of it, or what the big hurry is?”\n\n“Not so loud,” whispered Aronson. “The warehouseman said it would be somewhere in this corner.”\n\n“What are you whispering for?” the Lieutenant demanded.\n\n“We don’t want to warn the kid we’re coming.”\n\n“What makes you think the kid is here in the warehouse? How could he get in? It’s locked and guarded.”\n\n“He’s in the piano crate; he was shipped in it from Louisville.”\n\n“You’re crazy’”\n\n“You’ll see. Flash your light around.”\n\nThe circle of yellow light moved slowly down the row until it came to one larger than the rest.\n\n“The piano crate!” Al said. He checked the markings on the box. “This is it, all right.” Then he pointed to a series of round holes bored in the side of the box.\n\n“Just as I thought,” he whispered. “Air holes.”\n\nHunt swore under his breath; drew his gun.\n\nAl called out, “Okay, Frankie, we’ve got you covered. Come on out of the box.”\n\nNo answer.\n\nAronson motioned for Hunt to take cover. He himself stepped behind a large trunk, said loudly, “Okay, Hunt, let’s roll this lousy crate over on its side.”\n\nTwo shots splintered holes in the box. A hysterical voice called, “Stay away from me, you lousy bums. I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you!”\n\n“Be sensible, Kid,” the reporter called. “You can’t hit us because you can’t see us. But we can fill that box of yours full of lead; we can put more holes in it than a sieve. Come on out and give yourself up.”\n\nAn obscene curse was the only answer, and a third shot crashed wood and spanged into a metal drum. “Show him we mean business, Lieutenant,” Al said.\n\nThe detective fired a shot through the upper corner of the box.\n\n“Next one goes right through the middle,” Aronson called out “What do you say, Frankie?”\n\nThere was a moment of silence, then a muffled sob, and the side of the case swung slowly back on its hinges.\n\nFrankie Benson came out with his hands raised, crying. “Why did I do it?” he sobbed over mid over again. “Tell me why I did it. Why?”\n\nLieutenant Hunt examined the piano crate; said, “Hey, AJ, he really had this thing rigged up—a Pullman bunk, three pistols, water bottles, cans of food — and straps to hold everything in place. You ought to get a photographer down here. It will make a swell picture. You’ve got a great story—the story of the year.”\n\nBut Al Aronson was staring at the sniveling kid in front of him, still sobbing, “Why did I do it? Why? Why? Why?” The sneering, ruthless killer who had coldly murdered four men without the slightest compunction was now just a scared, pimply-faced 16-year-old boy, all mixed up.\n\nAnd Al knew that the story he would write, the story that would command banner headlines on the front page, would not really be the main story. The important story was the one that would answer Frankie Benson’s plaintive entreaty—”Why?”\n\nAnd that, Al thought sadly, was an answer he didn’t know—a story that would never be written.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

He’d read the latest on the torso murders, get a bowl of chili, and take in the double feature at the Bijou.\n\nBenny admired Gimpy’s quickness, as the lame little newsdealer slashed the ropes on the bundle of papers and whisked headlines into view. During the past couple months, since the tool factory reconverted and he’d been laid off, Benny had come to the park every day and watched Gimpy work. Benny had seen the steady business Gimpy did in papers and magazines. He’d got to thinking that when there were plenty of cigarettes, gum, and candy again, Gimpy would be needing a helper. Benny meant to get that job. It might not pay as much, buck for buck, as working in the stockroom at the factory, but there’d be no layoffs.\n\nBenny fished for a nickel, saw a big shot grab a paper from Gimpy, sit down, and turn to the stock market page. Benny eyed the black-eyed, black-mustached man cannily. Chances were the guy would be finished with the paper in a second.\n\nBenny waited, bright hazel eyes studying the headlines: Second Paper-wrapped Torso Found in Warehouse!\n\nThey were the same headlines as in the earlier editions, but Benny swallowed. Because when it happens close to home, that’s what you do—you swallow.\n\nSmaller type said, Victim identified as Teresa Famette, employee of Acme Tool Co.\n\nBenny shivered. Because when it happens to someone you know, you do that, too—you shiver.\n\nTessie Famette, the second victim, had worked in the offices at the tool company and had often brought inter-department memos to the stockroom to give Benny. So had Rosa Scalise, the girl whose dismembered body had turned up first, about ten days ago.\n\nThe papers said the killer was a maniac who prowled the tenement district where Tessie and Rosa had lived. Yet he must he an inconspicuous man, for no one had actually seen him drop one of the paper-wrapped parcels that had turned up in sewers, in refuse cans, in subway stations and movie houses.\n\nBenny Kerr blew his nose, winced at the swift pain in his nasal passages. Benny sniffled just as much now, in August, as in midwinter. Doc Kunz was treating him with some sort of medicine the doc had patented, but it didn’t seem to help much.\n\nAs Benny put his handkerchief away, his eyes drifted over the park bench up on the knoll, fascinated. One of the paper-wrapped packages had been found right there, a leg. Matt Hurley, the park cop, had sworn no suspicious strangers had been in the park that day.\n\nBenny leaned forward. The big shot had tossed his paper on the bench and was hailing a cab. Benny swooped and grabbed the paper. He saw the package underneath it, snatched it up, and turned to give it back to the man. But the man was already in the cab. It moved away. Benny yelled, and stood there waving the package foolishly.\n\nThat was when he got the impact of the big shot’s glittering black eyes for the first time. The man was looking through the rear window of the taxi, the skin on his cheekbones drawn tight, his lips a white slash. His black eyes were like chips of hard coal behind which a fire blazed.\n\nBenny couldn’t pull his gaze away from those hypnotic eyes until the man whipped around to the taxicab driver.\n\nBenny saw the driver shake his head and gestured at the streams of traffic on both sides. He couldn’t stop.\n\nThe eyes came back to Benny, burned through the window, burned into Benny’s scrawny little form, cataloguing every detail. Benny grabbed for his handkerchief. He was sniffling.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nHe Might Even Be You\n\nThe cab was lost in traffic, then. Benny was left clutching the oblong package. He hefted it, licking his Ups. There must be something pretty valuable in it. That’s why the black-eyed man had studied him; he wanted his package back.\n\nIt was heavier than it looked, pliable yet resistant. It was the size and shape of a roll of bologna. Benny couldn’t resist looking. He intended to stay right where he was, sure that the big shot would get out of the cab and hurry back here first chance. Just the same he couldn’t resist looking.\n\nBenny pulled the string off one end, parted the paper. Then he stiffened and felt the hard seat of the park bench behind him catch his thighs, as his knees gave out. Every muscle in Benny’s skinny frame became a tight, twanging string. His hazel eyes glazed. His one look had told him he was holding one of those packages!\n\nIt was the bull voice of Matt Hurley, the park cop, that brought Benny awake. “Benny! Hey, you forgot your package!” Benny skidded, shook his head, stopped. He saw that he was thirty feet from the bench where he’d found it. He’d been fleeing instinctively.\n\nHurley’s red-faced bulk plodded toward Benny. One massive, freckled paw shoved the package back into Benny’s hand. The other held the newspaper Hurley had picked up. He glared at the headlines.\n\n“If I could just get my mitts on that guy!” Hurley burst out. “They say he’s a nut, but I say different. He’s a guy we probably know, somebody right down in our neighborhood, somebody who hangs around the park, too. He could be anybody at all. He might even be you, Benny. He left one of those packages right here under my nose. I’d just like to see him leave another one! What’s the matter, Benny? Sick?”\n\n“Y-yeah!” Benny gurgled, his thin cheeks like ashes.\n\nHurley slapped Benny’s shoulder. “Better tell Doc Kunz to give you regular medicine, not any of that stuff he makes up himself. See you tomorrow, kid.”\n\nBenny watched Hurley’s blue-coated back move off. He scuttled to a refuse can, caught himself. No! If the package were found here, Hurley surely would remember Benny had had one. For a second, Benny tried to get enough moisture into his mouth to yell after Hurley. Then he recalled Hurley’s words. He could be anybody, anybody at all. He might even be you, Benny.\n\nBenny’s paper-thin soles slapped the sidewalk. He had to run. Hide. Get rid of it.\n\nYet he couldn’t get rid of it. He couldn’t drop it, throw it, not in this neighborhood. It was a magnet, sticking to him, sending its clammy coldness through the paper to paralyze his fingers. Benny fled to the only cover he could think of—his room.\n\nHe’d forgotten the black-eyed, black-mustached man. Suddenly he thought of him again, glanced back over his shoulder like a scrawny hound dog might glance at a can tied to his tail. Benny didn’t see the man. He decided the man wouldn’t be coming back after all. Why would anybody come back after this, if he’d once got rid of it?\n\nBut Benny was wrong. If he’d looked again, he’d have seen those black eyes hard on him, craftily waiting.\n\nBenny took his usual route home. Six blocks from the park, he turned right, five blocks more, right again. Down an alley, past the warehouse—\n\nThat’s where Benny’s teeth chattered harder. Here, in this gloomy old building, was where Tessie’s torso had been found. There was a crowd around, though the homicide squad was gone.\n\n“Hello, Benny,” said Doc Kunz. Benny jerked. The gaunt black shoestring of a doctor was at his elbow, slightly bleared blue eyes studying him professionally.\n\n“What’s wrong, Benny?” Kunz asked. “Excitement too much for you?”\n\nBenny’s lips worked. He almost blurted it out. He was reaching the point where he had to tell someone.\n\n“N-noI I’m okay, doc I” Benny blurted and ducked toward the sanctuary of his room.\n\n“I’ll stop in and have a look at you after I see Mrs. Grady,” Kunz said.\n\n“No! Don’t come near. I mean, okay, doc!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Black-Eyed Man\n\nBenny ducked into the doorway of the tenement where he lived. He went up the first two flights fast, but on the third his chest began to hurt. He stopped, leaned against the narrow bannister, breathing jerkily at the musty, thick-hot air.\n\nThe black-eyed man was breathing rapidly, too. This sound was what sent Benny’s eyes skittering behind him.\n\nA shriek tore at his vocal chords, never sounded. Benny couldn’t get it out. Then the black-eyed man was upon him, hand clamped over Benny’s mouth. The steel- strong fingers ground the bones of Benny’s jaw together, bruised Benny’s lips.\n\n“Be quiet! Take me to your room. I’ll make you rich if you hold your tongue.”\n\nThe man shook Benny a little, eyes glowing even in the shadows of the stairway. He took his hands away tentatively, grabbed Benny again. Benny would have melted onto the steps without support. The only thing with strength was his heart, thumping, thumping. He even dropped the package.\n\nThe black-eyed man scooped up the package, pushed Benny ahead. There was no sound from him. He might have slipped away, Benny thought, as he reeled up the last steps to his room, only he hadn’t. Benny could feel the man, back there. He could feel his eyes. Benny turned the knob of his door, tried to dive in and slam it.\n\nThe man was ready for him. He shoved Benny into the room, slammed the door himself, snicked the lock. Benny backed away from him, still unable to make more that little, squeaking sounds. He backed into the bed, fell on it.\n\nDeath reached for his throat. Benny saw the slender, strong fingers stretch an l start for him. He saw the burning black eyes, the slashed lips under the black mustache. He scrounged back on the bed, hit the wall. He could go no farther. He felt his mouth opening, his tongue protruding, his eyes bulging even before the fingers touched him. He was choking himself, practically.\n\nHe felt his head get thick. Blackness swirled around him. Then those hands were on him. But they weren’t choking him. They were shaking him, jarring him back to consciousness. And the black- eyed man’s low voice was warning, “Quiet.”\n\nBenny saw why now. He heard the knocking on his door. He heard Doc Kunz’s voice insisting, “Let me in, Benny. I want to look at you.”\n\nThe black-eyed man caught Benny’s chin in his hand, turned Benny’s eyes up into his own. The whole strength of the man’s personality was in the onyx stare he centered on Benny. That stare held Benny transfixed, sucked the little strength out of him, bored in under his hide.\n\n“Meet me in the park tonight at nine o’clock,” the man commanded softly. “I’ll be on the bench I sat on today. I’ll have money for you, a thousand dollars. That will be only the first payment. I’ll make you rich, understand?”\n\n“Benny, let me in!” Doc Kunz roared.\n\n“Will you be there?” the black-eyed man hissed. “Do you want money?”\n\nBenny heard a voice not at all like his own pant, “Yeah! Yeah, I’ll be there! Yeah, I want money! Yeah, yeah, yeah!”\n\nHe realized vaguely that something stronger than himself had taken over, instinct. He was saying anything at all to gain respite, anything to get this black- eyed monster away.\n\nThe man hesitated, trying, it seemed, to peel back Benny’s skull and look inside it. Suddenly he grated his teeth like a man risking all on a long shot. “I’ll give you five thousand for the first payment!” he said harshly. “Nine o’clock. The park. Be there. No harm will come to you.”\n\nThe man looked about the room for another means of exit, scorned the fire escape window, strode to the door, unlocked it and pushed past Doc Kunz brazenly.\n\nKunz fell back in surprise. “I’ll be damned!” He turned to Benny as the man disappeared down the stairs. “How did you ever get him interested in your case, Benny?” Kunz demanded.\n\nBenny croaked, “Him? Is he a d-d-doc-tor?”\n\n“Why, he’s famous!” Kunz said. “Dr. Haswell Falik. He’s a psychiatrist. He—\n\nBut Benny was blacking out now. The strain was over. The reaction set in …\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nMeet Falik\n\nWhen Benny came to, there was a pleasant stupor in his limbs. He was in bed. Doc Kunz was bending over him. The doctor’s words came slowly, as from a great distance. He was questioning Benny. Benny answered with no trouble at all. He didn’t realize that the morphine Kunz had given him was responsible for his sense of ease and well-being. He knew only that he was safe and sleepy. He told his story from beginning to end.\n\nBenny heard Doc exclaim occasionally. He heard him mutter, too. But Benny didn’t pay much attention. Once, he looked up at Doc’s gaunt, cadaverous face, the lines of dissipation running from Doc’s nostrils to his lax lips, and thought vaguely that the doctor looked like a man who was smoking marijuana. The doc’s blue eyes weren’t a bit bleary now. The parchment-like skin on his high cheekbones showed spots of color. His long arms flapped about him, the fingers twitching.\n\nBenny heard the doc muttering, “Falik? The great Haswell Falik! The mind doctor gone the way of his patients. He’ll plead insanity, of course. The fool!”\n\nBenny saw the doc’s hollow eyes glow. Suddenly they were almost like those black eyes that could pin his heart to his ribs with just a look.\n\n“He was going to take advantage of me!” Doc Kunz mumbled. Then he laughed loudly and long. He didn’t laugh at anything funny, though. He cackled. He took a bottle from his bag and drank deeply. Then he tramped from the room.\n\nBenny let blissful drowsiness overcome him. He went to sleep, troubled only by the sudden wonder at how Dr. Falik could possibly have been going to take advantage of Doc Kunz. Kunz was a seedy slum doctor. Falik was a big- shot psychiatrist. Doc Kunz had recognized Falik, because Falik was famous. But Falik hadn’t even noticed Doc Kunz. So why or how could he take advantage of him?\n\nWhen Benny awoke, Doc Kunz was beside him again. “Listen, Benny, I know everything. Everything, understand? You told it all while you were half-conscious. Don’t be afraid, Benny. You’ve got to help me catch Falik.”\n\nDoc Kunz cackled at that and repeated, “Catch Falik! Ah, that’s good!”\n\nBenny felt prickles between his shoulder blades. He shook his head groggily. The doc didn’t look like himself at all, didn’t sound like himself. Benny sat up, pulling the sheet around his thin chest.\n\n“Look, Benny!” Doc Kunz shoved a newspaper onto Benny’s knees. “The arm you found in that package didn’t belong to Tessie Famette at all. It belonged to somebody else, another torso victim, Benny. Falik’s victim!”\n\nBenny gazed at the newspaper, at a paragraph on an inside page which said, “Mr. and Mrs. Jason Devers today told the police that their daughter Jennifer, 22, has not been home for two days. Mr. Devers admitted that his daughter had been under the care of Dr. Haswell Falik, eminent psychiatrist. Dr. Falik insisted the girl was quite normal when she left his office, two days ago, but no trace of her can be found.”\n\nDoc Kunz cackled, “Of course, no trace of her was found. Falik killed her. Dissected her body, and started to get rid of it just like—Never mind, that was the Devers’ girl’s arm you found, Benny, not Tessie Famette’s. Now tonight, Benny I want you to meet—”\n\n“Falik?” Benny cried. “No! I won’t! I can’t! Doc, I’m too scared of him! He’ll get me, too!”\n\n“No, he won’t Benny!” Doc said sharply. “Don’t worry. You’ll help catch him, that’s all.”\n\nBenny shrank against his pillow. “No! I’m afraid. I’m going to tell the cops. I’m going to get Matt Hurley and—” The doc chuckled, “I’ve already talked to Hurley, Benny! He’ll be right on hand, don’t think he won’t. He’s going to be in the park. When Falik tries to—”\n\n“Tries to kill me!” Benny burst. “Is that it? You’re going to use me as bait!”\n\n“Easy, now, Benny,” Doc soothed. “You don’t have anything to be afraid of. Hurley won’t let anything happen. He’ll be right there. He’ll catch Falik red-handed. That’s what we want, don’t we? Benny, you want Falik caught, don’t you?”\n\nBenny sniffled. “I don’t care! I’m scared! Once I look at his eyes, Doc, I–”\n\n“Pshaw! Don’t look at them, then. You’re afraid Falik will hypnotize you? Nonsense!” Doc Kunz snorted. “I’m a doctor, too, Benny. Falik uses hypnotism, sure, but no one can hypnotize you if you resist them. They can’t do it with one look, either. Don’t be afraid of that, Benny. Hurley and I will be close. All you have to do is go with Falik, do what he wants you to do. He’ll lead us to the rest of the Devers girl’s body.”\n\n“But, doc—”\n\n“Now, Benny,” Doc Kunz frowned. “You want to co-operate with the cops, don’t you? You don’t want Matt Hurley to think you’re protecting Falik?”\n\n“No!”\n\n“Good! That’s the stuff. Now look. It’s only eight o’clock. Get your clothes on, but don’t leave here for about forty minutes. About a quarter to nine or a little earlier, go over to the park. Meet Falik and do everything he tells you. Got that?”\n\nBenny peered at Doc’s burning eyes, his gaunt, lined face. The doctor looked like a buzzard, like a leering old buzzard getting ready to pounce.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nBut No Hurley\n\nBenny forced himself to nod. He understood all too well. He was bait. Doc said he and Matt Hurley would be nearby, but Benny chewed his lips and sniffled. Benny wouldn’t let tears come to his eyes while Doc was there, but when the black, stringy man left the room Benny hugged the sheet around himself tightly.\n\nHe fumbled with his clothing. It was hot and muggy, but he went to the closet and put on a blue turtleneck sweater that was slack around his toothpick neck.\n\nHe told himself he was okay. Hurley and Doc Kunz were on his side. He was already cleared so far as having had that package in his possession, because Doc had told Hurley how it had happened. Hurley believed Doc. But would the big cop continue to believe Doc if Benny didn’t play his part tonight?\n\nBenny trembled. He had to go through with it. If he didn’t show up, Hurley would figure Doc had been drunk and had spun a crazy story. Just the same, the cop would come back at Benny, drag him down to headquarters.\n\nThe minutes ticked away with maddening slowness, yet with haste, too. Benny couldn’t understand it; his old alarm clock dragged and hurried at the same time. Twenty minutes whispered by. Another twenty.\n\n“Suppose Falik comes here!” The words blurted out of Benny’s white lips, hung in the hot air in his tiny room echoed off the walls. For two full minutes afterwards Benny was incapable of motion. The paroxysms of trembling shot down into his legs. He scampered for the door. He stopped, fingers on the knob, ears actually moving.\n\nSomeone was coming up the stairs. Benny’s nostrils quivered, but he couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t even sniffle.\n\nThe almost inaudible scrape of feet on the staircase were so light a mouse might be causing them. Only Benny knew it was no mouse. It was a human being, coming closer, coming toward the door, stopping outside, leaning his ear against the flimsy wood.\n\nBenny Kerr moved again as he had done when he’d fled from the park bench that afternoon, instinctively, without conscious volition. He ducked out the window and clambered down the fire escape. It wasn’t until he was in the alley behind the tenement building that he became conscious of hi3 surroundings. It was black down there, a fearsome place to be caught.\n\nBenny looked up, saw a shadow on the fire escape. He ran as he never had run before. At long last, the nervous energy found some place to spend itself. Benny’s thin legs turned into driving pistons. The hard slap-slap of his feet was a tattoo on the cobbled alley. It was a sweet sound in Benny’s ears. For as energy surged through his limbs, he knew he was running as a champion sprinter. Nothing on two legs would catch him if he kept this up.\n\nThere was another thing, too. If Falik was chasing him, then Falik wasn’t in the park. Benny could run there and yell for Hurley and Doc. They’d jump out and pounce on Falik then, with no more laying traps. They’d grab the black-eyed man quick. Benny would see them with his own two eyes. He knew he’d never have nerve enough to enter his room again unless he did see Falik captured.\n\nBenny passed the warehouse like a wraith. He went down an alley. Turn left. Left again.\n\nBenny slackened a little, approached the park warily. Hurley and Doc Kunz would be hiding somewhere, probably near the bench where Benny was supposed to meet Falik. Benny’s eyes darted toward that bench. His senses reeled. Falik was there!\n\nBenny couldn’t believe it, yet it was so. Falik was alone on the bench, waiting. Benny shook his head. Falik must have grabbed a taxi when he’d failed to catch Benny and hurried to the park. Benny wanted to cry. Now he’d have to go through with it after all.\n\nHe glanced fitfully about. If he could get just one glimpse of Matt Hurley’s bulk, he’d feel better. But Hurley was nowhere in sight. There were a couple of old men scattered about on the benches, some kids, but no Hurley.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nRoom 317\n\n“It’s okay, Benny.” The voice came from nowhere. Benny jumped. It came again. “Don’t worry, Benny. I’m behind this tree.”\n\nBenny saw who it was, now—Doc Kunz. His long, cadaverous frame blended into the shadow behind a tree. He waved Benny toward the bench where Falik sat.\n\nBenny stumbled forward, walked up to Falik. “H-here I am,” he stuttered.\n\nThe black eyes impaled him. In the night they seemed deeper, darker, yet more fiery, too.\n\nFalik’s lips and mustache didn’t move, but his words were clear. “Go across the street to the Grayson Hotel. Room 317. The door is open. Don’t talk to anybody. I’ll follow you. I’ve got the money,” Falik added quickly.\n\nBenny didn’t bother to nod. He made a beeline for the hotel, a third-rate place with a shabby, deserted lobby. The desk clerk glanced carelessly at Benny, then away. Benny skittered toward the stairs. He didn’t know why he avoided the elevator, but had he seen the pleased light in the black eyes behind him when the desk clerk paid him no attention, he would have stopped dead.\n\nBenny climbed to the third floor. Room 317 was unlocked, as Falik had said it would be. Benny went in, switched on the lights. In a second, Falik came in. He looked Benny coldly up and down, then he looked away. For once, those black eyes stopped boring into Benny’s soul.\n\nBenny held his breath. What was Falik waiting for? Why didn’t he say something, do something?\n\nBenny got his answer when the door opened again and Doc Kunz came in.\n\nDoc Kunz came in!\n\nDoc nodded to Falik. Doc took a little phial from his pocket. Doc said, “Ready, Falik?”\n\nThat was when the blinding truth flooded through Benny Kerr. Not all the truth, just the most important part for him.\n\nDoc wasn’t on his side, he was on Falik’s side!\n\nBenny charged for the door. Falik caught him from behind. Doc’s long stringy arms shot out in front. Falik dragged Benny back to the bed, forced him down on it, pinned him with a knee, used those steel fingers again on Benny’s mouth.\n\nBut this time to force Benny’s mouth open, not shut. For Doc Kunz had uncorked the phial and was ready to force the contents down Benny’s throat.\n\nHe did it. He jammed the neck of the phial between Benny’s lips as Falik’s fingers forced open Benny’s mouth. Benny felt bitter liquid trickling over his tongue, down his throat.\n\nHe knew it was poison. He knew Falik and Doc Kunz were murdering him. He felt the poison hit his stomach. He felt himself grow weak. He thought, They’ll cut me up and wrap me in packages.\n\nFalik’s knee came off Benny’s chest. Benny tried to rise, couldn’t. A heavy lethargy was upon him. He could see dimly, hear vaguely, but he couldn’t speak or move.\n\nAs in a dream, he saw Falik go to the closet, pull out paper-wrapped packages. There was the package Benny had discovered, he could never mistake that. There was another package like it. There were two more like those, only larger. Then there was a fifth package, larger. But Falik handled it easily. Jennifer Devers hadn’t been heavy.\n\n“You don’t have to drag them out,” Doc Kunz said thickly. “Don’t you think the cops will search the place?”\n\n“Do you think they’ll believe its suicide?” Falik asked uncertainly.\n\nDoc Kunz cackled. “What else? Don’t worry about that. I’ve already talked to a cop, suggested that Benny was a little nutty. I talked to Matt Hurley about ten minutes before Benny was due to leave for the park. Hurley went over to question him, so he’s looking for him right now.”\n\nFalik nodded. Benny saw him only as a blur. Benny was realizing that he had fled from Hurley, not Falik. If only he hadn’t, he thought. If only he hadn’t.\n\nIt was too late, though, and dying wasn’t so hard after all. It was pleasant, really. Like going to sleep, positive that you will sleep sound, without dreaming.\n\nFalik’s words drifted to him dimly. “You fool! Do you think I’m going to let you live to blackmail me?”\n\nBenny heard a faint little popping somewhere. It didn’t sound loud enough to be a gun. But a second later, there was the bam of a Police Positive. Benny knew that was a gun all right. The first one must have had a silencer on it, he thought. He drifted off … .\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nMight Even Be Me\n\nClearly it was much harder getting awake than it had been going to sleep. Sleeping had been peaceful. Getting awake again brought with it pain and nausea. The thick, rubbery thing in his mouth, Benny learned later, was a stomach pump.\n\n“You’re tougher than you look, Benny boy,” said a voice.\n\nBenny saw Matt Hurley’s red face beaming at him. “How did you—”\n\n“Take it easy, kid,” Hurley said. “You’re a good little runner, but I’m not so bad myself. I chased after you to the park, caught up just in time to see you go across to that hotel. Falik followed you, and Doc Kunz followed Falik. I strung along and listened outside the hotel room door. I didn’t know they were going to feed you poison and leave you there with the Devers girl’s body. But when Falik took a shot at Doc Kunz, I jumped in and took a shot at him. Doc Kunz is dead but he talked. I only winged Falik; he’ll go to the chair.” Benny gagged a little. “They were going to kill me, leave me there with Jennifer Devers’ body so you’d think I was the maniac killer.”\n\nHurley nodded. “But there was no maniac after all. Doc Kunz cut up the first two bodies to cover himself. What happened, Benny, was that Doc gave Rosa Scalise, the first girl to be found, some of his homemade medicine and it killed her. To cover himself, he cut her up like that, figuring the public would think a maniac was loose. Tessie Famette, the second victim, was Rosa Scalise’s friend who knew Rosa had been going to Doc Kunz. She got suspicious so Doc killed her too.”\n\nBenny burst, “And when Falik killed the third girl, Jennifer Dever3, he tried to take advantage—” Benny stopped, recalling Doc Kunz’s mutterings that afternoon. “That’s what Doc Kunz meant when he said Falik was trying to take advantage of him!”\n\n“Right,” Hurley agreed. “Falik got the story of a secret marriage out of Jennifer Devers when he was treating her. He blackmailed her for months. Then she said she was going to the cops, and Falik killed her. He figured if he cut her up and planted packages around the neighborhood where two other torso murders had already been done, the^ same man would be blamed for everything.”\n\n“Only I caught him planting the very first package,” Benny shuddered.\n\n“Well, you’re always hanging around the park,” Hurley shrugged. “It wasn’t so funny that it was you who saw him. The thing was you should have told me right away instead of Doc Kunz. The minute Kunz knew you’d found another package, he knew somebody else had committed murder. Even if he hadn’t seen Falik in your room, he could easily have searched the paper for missing people and figured out who had killed who. He saw a chance to frame it all on the dumb bunny who had blundered into it—you, Benny; so he went to Falik. They worked together until they thought everything was set.”\n\nHurley shook his head reprovingly. “You should’ve told me, Benny. You should’ve told me right off. Why didn’t you?”\n\nBenny shivered all over. “Because you said it—might even be me!”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Out of the radio cabinet on the table near his elbow boiled the voice of an excited mike ragger, but his words barely registered on the headquarters man’s soporific brain.\n\n” — Last of the eighth. It’s the Blues at bat, fans. They’ve got the only run of the game and this one run looks bigger every minute. This game means the pennant for whoever finishes out in front. Big Joe Waltham is up there swinging his big bat and the crowd is still making a lot of noise. Beginning to rain a little harder now — “\n\nJim Toller had wanted to see that game between the Centralia Blues and the Midville Mudhens. He guessed that about everybody in Centralia had gone to that night baseball game over in Midville. The town had been baseball crazy for a week. But Jim Toller had had a tough day of it trying to get the goods on a pair of hot-car dealers. He yawned, stretched and reached out to turn the radio on louder.\n\n” — Raining pretty hard now. There are no covered stands here in Midville, but the crowd doesn’t seem to mind about getting wet.”\n\nJim Toller idly reached out for a paper. Headlines barked at him:\n\n\n  FATHER’S MONEY SAVES PLAYBOY FROM JAIL\nManslaughter Charge Against Young Manther Dismissed\nCase Settled Out of Court\n\n\nThe detective smirked. Like most of the people in Centralia he had been hoping that Ted Manther would get the limit. The story had inflamed the citizens of the small metropolis for weeks. Young Manther had been in plenty of trouble long before running over and killing a child in the street.\n\nJim Toller had been at police headquarters when Manther had been brought in. The millionaire manufacturer’s son had had no recollection of having hit anybody — he had been that drunk. A burly policeman had beaten a lot of the liquor fumes out of the playboy’s brain that night, and Jim Toller had itched for a chance to get in a few punches of his own. Outside the jail a crowd had gathered yelling for young Manther’s blood.\n\nJim Toller threw the paper aside and mumbled: “That kind of guy would get off. Been somebody like me — “\n\nHe stretched, fell back in his chair and the voice issuing from the radio gradually grew fainter in his ears.\n\n” — Raining pitchforks here now. Last of the ninth. The Mudhens have two more men coming up. Lefty Hoyt’s got one out. Only two more and the Blues win the pennant, fans.”\n\nJim Toller was asleep. The insistent ringing of the telephone woke him up almost an hour later. He glanced at the clock, forcibly banishing the sleep from his eyes, and reached for the jangling phone; the hands of the clock said eleven-fifteen as he barked: “Hello?” into the transmitter.\n\n“Headquarters calling, Jim? We’ve been ringin’ for five minutes. Car’s on the way there now to pick you up,” a gruff voice ran on. “Nobody but T. J. Manther’s been bumped off. Yeah — Roy Manther found him when he got back from the ball game. Looks like that no good rat of a brother of his got himself into a real jam this time.”\n\nDetective Toller banged the phone onto its cradle, snatched up his topcoat and hat from where he had thrown them hours before, and went out of his little flat on the double. A police car was crowding toward the curb when he got out into the street. While it was still rolling the detective climbed in and fell into the back seat between two burly cops.\n\n“Big stuff!” he cracked.\n\n“You won’t need to do much snoopin’,” one of the cops said. “Y’know that Manther kicked the kid outta the house after he got him out of that last mess. Cost him close to fifty grand, I heard. Young Manther’s been next to broke an’ he got kicked out of his club. Been living in that little caretaker’s cottage right near the main road.”\n\n“Yeah,” Jim clipped, “I guess I won’t never get a chance to show the chief anything. The only big bump-off since I turned in my night stick, an’ it’s all cut an’ dried. Nuts!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Manther’s Gabled Mansion\n\nThe Manther’s had a show place three miles outside of Centralia. It was a huge, gabled mansion half hidden by tall pine trees, and from the eminence on which it was built it seemed to look down with disdain upon the rest of the habitations sprawled around it. When the police car climbed the winding road and rolled into the big front yard, Jim Toller saw a long sleek coupe standing in front of the house, its lights still on. The detective eyed the ornamental car with a bit of envy as he followed the cops up to the door.\n\nA tall man in his late thirties opened the door suddenly as they approached. His hat was off and a camel’s hair polo coat dangled loosely from his broad shoulders. Roy Manther’s face was pale, the whiteness accentuated by the hall light. Jim Toller had seen him around town a lot. The elder of the two Manther sons was like his father, as different from his brother, Ted, as milk is from wine. He was the son who had been content to go into his father’s business and make a go of it.\n\nJim Toller followed the nod of Roy Manther who said in a tight voice: “In there.”\n\nAll the men went into a large room that was lined with shelves on three sides, all completely filled with books.\n\nA bulky man with iron-gray hair was slumped sidewise in his chair, one arm hanging over the arm, fingers just short of touching the rug. There was an ugly hole between his eyes and an unwholesome blue-white pallor to his face. In one corner of the room stood a thin, gaunt man, a soiled terrycloth robe wrapped around him, wide eyes staring at the dead body of the man known to the world as the great “T. Jay.”\n\nDetective Toller said to the dead man’s son: “You — you’ve got a pretty good idea who did it, I guess. Sorry to have to speak so bluntly but — “\n\nYoung Manther nodded.\n\n“He’s down there in that cottage near the road. Hasn’t hardly drawn a sober breath since we got him out of jail. I went in there. He’s lyin’ on the bed with the pistol in his hand. He must — have — shot dad from the open window because he was not allowed in the house. He hasn’t a key and dad would have seen him if he had tried to get in through that window.”\n\nManther plunged his hands into the pockets of his loosely worn coat, idly took one out and looked at a folded square of pasteboard that it held. Jim Toller took swift notice, saw that it was a score card.\n\nHe suddenly said:\n\n“Where’s the coroner, Mike? He ought to be here.”\n\nRoy Manther swore softly, and Toller thought that a little sob came out of his throat.\n\n“To think we have to go all through this after what has already happened. He must have sobered up — a little, then came up here to — He was a crack shot with any kind of a gun. He belonged to the gun club in town. He — “\n\nBrakes squealed outside and tires bit into gravel. A few moments later a small, fat man bustled in breathing fussily. The cops stepped aside and let him have room to open his ominous black bag and go to work. Jim Toller knelt down and picked up an unlighted cigar from the floor. It bore mute evidence of the murdered man’s mood at the time of his death, for fully two inches of the rich weed had been chewed to shreds.\n\n“He always did that when he was angry or worried about anything,” Roy Manther volunteered, speaking of his father.\n\nBefore Jim Toller could respond, the coroner made a blunt statement.\n\n“Been dead a couple of hours — not more. Looks like a bullet — about a thirty-eight — went into his brain.”\n\nThe fat little man thrust a pudgy hand into his black bag and pulled out a long, thin, shiny instrument. Toller and two of the cops turned away.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nShot From Beyond the Window\n\nThe coroner finally snapped his black bag shut, called to Toller. The detective stepped up close. Roy Manther was just behind him.\n\n“The bullet did not go very far into his head. I’d say he wasn’t shot from very close up,” the medical man said. “A good shot could have stood out beyond the window and nailed him, Toller. That slug would have gone right through his head if a man had stood — say, right here.”\n\nJim Toller looked at Manther, said: “Looks like this won’t be much of a case. Your brother could have made a shot like that.”\n\nManther tightened his lips, said: “Yes. You’d better go down to the cottage and pick him up.”\n\nJim Toller said: “If he is as drunk as you say, he’ll wait. After he killed his father, he must have gone down there to pack a bag. His nerves were ragged and he took a stiff drink. He took a couple more and then forgot what he had intended to do.”\n\nHe stabbed a finger at the gaunt man who still stood as if mesmerized by the sight of the dead man.\n\n“You find the body?”\n\nThe servant said: “Beg pardon. I did not catch — “\n\nRoy Manther cut in: “No. I came in, Toller, and saw him like that.”\n\n“You mean,” the headquarters man shot at the servant, “that you didn’t hear a shot?”\n\nThe frightened retainer shook his head.\n\n“N-no, I did not. I sleep on the third floor and I sleep very heavy, too, sir. Mr. Manther let me retire about nine o’clock. I’m getting quite hard of hearing, sir.?\n\n“Any other servants in the house?”\n\n“None,” Roy Manther answered. “We discharged the housekeeper a couple of days ago. Incompetent,” he added crisply.\n\n“I left for Midville just after dinner. I stopped in to see Ted — my brother down at the cottage — and asked him if he felt in shape to go with me. He growled something about getting thrown out — said he might make it tougher than the old man thought. Anyway he said something that sounded like that. He had a terrible hangover, looked pretty bad.”\n\n“Hmm,” commented the detective. “He had been tossed out. He needed money, eh? You think that was what he wanted? That because your father wouldn’t give it to him, he — “\n\nRoy Manther did not respond. His eyes were on the wall near the front of the house.\n\n“Behind those books there,” he said, “is a safe. Somebody’s been moving the books!”\n\nJim Toller followed him across the room. Manther yanked some loose books out of the case and dumped them into a chair. In the space thus revealed, the detective saw a small safe door standing open about an inch. The dead man’s son swung it wide and plunged a hand into the black depths of the built-in safe. He pulled out a lot of papers and hurriedly examined them.\n\n“There was five thousand dollars in here last night,” he said excitedly. “Dad put it there. I brought it home with me.” He looked out into the night, his face hard, eyes stormy. “The rat — the no-good rat! I ought to kill him!”\n\nJim Toller thought awhile. Then he said: “He shot his father first so that there would be no angry outcry to reach up to where the butler slept. He knew there would be a fuss once his father saw him coming in. When the job was done, he came in through the window and robbed the safe.”\n\nToller turned to Manther and a couple of men from headquarters.\n\n“Let’s go down and take him.”\n\nToller and Roy Manther and the cops went down to the little cottage at the end of the winding driveway in a headquarters car. They found Ted Manther, fully clothed, lying on a bed. There was a whiskey bottle on the floor. Jim Toller found five thousand dollars in his pockets. The gun that had killed the man up at the gabled house was clutched in his hand. Roy Manther lifted him up, cracked the palm of his hand against his brother’s face a half dozen times. The drunken man’s eyes opened suddenly and he babbled something.\n\n“The dirty louse,” a cop said, “too bad they can’t give him the chair.”\n\n“Why can’t they?” Roy Manther ground out. “He — “\n\nJim Toller nodded, said: “He was drunk. A jury — “\n\nHe dragged the drunken man off the bed, shook him savagely. “Come on, kid. We’re goin’ up to the house and show you somethin’ nice. Maybe you’ll save the state a lot of trouble by telling us everything.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nTed Manther, Arrested for Murder\n\nThe car went up to the mansion again, and Toller and the cops half dragged Ted Manther inside.\n\nThe dead-wagon crew stood waiting for permission to remove the body, but Toller said as he shoved his prisoner toward the corpse: “In just a minute, boys.”\n\nTed Manther gazed at the corpse dully for several moments. Then his brain was shocked free of the numbing fumes of liquor, and he cried out: “He — No! No, he can’t be — Where’s Roy? Roy!”\n\n“Here I am, you rat!” his brother snarled at him. “Look at what you’ve done now. This time nothing can save you. He’s dead — and you killed him! You hear?”\n\n“N-no!” Ted Manther shuddered and pawed at his pasty face with his free left hand. His red-rimmed eyes were glassy, but he had been shocked sober.\n\n“I — I didn’t — I c-couldn’t. Oh-h-h, my — “\n\n“Get him out of here!” Jim Toller said tersely. “Book him for murder. I’ll be downtown later. Maybe Mr. Manther” — he turned to Roy — “maybe you will drive me back?”\n\n“Of course,” Roy Manther said, visibly shaken. “Excuse me for awhile, will you ? I — I need a drink myself — right now.”\n\n“I should think you would,” Jim said. He strode to the window and called out: “Mike, before you go, snap out the lights on that coupe out there, will you?”\n\nHe turned back into the room then and watched while the body of T. J. Manther was being placed in the undertaker’s basket and carried out. The engine of the dead wagon raced and soon it went out of the grounds, tires crunching gravel.\n\nJim Toller grinned icily, took a pack of smokes out of his pocket. He selected a cigarette, touched a match to it and sucked sweet smoke into his lungs. It stimulated his brain, a brain that had been working with well-attuned mechanism for the past ten minutes. He crossed the library and picked up the score card that Roy Manther had tossed to the table. He opened it and saw that the Blues had won the game.\n\n“Ha,” he chuckled, “I win five bucks!” and he slipped the card into his pocket.\n\nJim Toller crossed the room again to where the body had been found. He stood looking at the blood-stained chair for several moments, then stooped over and picked up something that had been wedged between the big cushion and the arm of the easy chair. Apparently it had fallen from the dead man’s clothes. It was a small chunk of partially charred stuff that the detective pulled at with his fingers. It was wadding, and Toller knew it had come out of a cartridge. But why?\n\nThe detective suddenly snapped his teeth together with an audible click and swung around to look at the window. He smiled thinly, crossed the room slowly as Roy Manther came out of the hall.\n\n“If you’re ready, Toller,” Manther said, “I’ll drive you into town.”\n\nHe picked up his hat and went out again.\n\nJim Toller said, almost unaware of it; “Okay, I’ll be right out.”\n\nIt was five minutes before he left the room. During that time, a lot of loose ends had been gathered in, and Jim Toller nodded grimly as he walked out of the house.\n\nRoy Manther had the engine of his coupe running. He seemed to be a little impatient when Toller got in, and the detective apologized.\n\n“Sorry to put you out like this,” he said. “Especially at a time like this?\n\n“Oh, that’s all right,” the bereaved man replied. “I couldn’t stay in that house tonight, anyway. Maybe I won’t — ever again. I’d keep seeing him there — like he was — I’ll stay at a hotel.”\n\n“Pretty terrible when you think of it,” Jim Toller remarked as the big coupé went down the winding road to the main highway. “A son killing his own father. Know how you must feel, Manther.”\n\nHe was silent for quite a while after that. Then: “Some game last night. I didn’t figure the Blues would cop.”\n\n“It was a great game all right,” Roy Manther said. “Lefty Hoyt sure mowed down those Mudhen sluggers. But — listen, Toller, would you mind if I don’t — talk about it. If I had only stayed home!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Acrid Smell of Cordite\n\nToller nodded amiably, his brain still trying to tell him something. He turned the handle on the side of the door and opened a small window to let in some air. Sparks flew from his cigarette and bit into the driver’s face.\n\n“Sorry,” said the man from headquarters, taking the cigarette from between his lips. He leaned forward to put it into the ash receiver, but it slipped out of his hands. A sudden, brief hissing sound came from the rubber matting on the floor of the coupe, and Jim Toller looked down, eyes a little wide.\n\nThe coupe swung toward the ditch and Toller yelled: “Look out, Manther!”\n\nThe driver bore down on the brake pedal. Tires squealed as he swung the wheel sharply and brought the car back onto the macadam. Jim Toller swung his face toward Manther, startled out of his usual calm by the narrow squeak. Roy Manther swore and ripped out: “My nerves are shot. Guess there was a little water there on the floor.”\n\nJim Toller said nothing. His nostrils flared, and he sat there with an acrid odor biting up into his brain.\n\n“Sorry to give you that scare, Toller,” Manther apologized. “I’ve been through a lot tonight, y’know.”\n\nHis passenger nodded, eyeing the floor at his feet.\n\n“Some boiler,” he commented. “They say these cars can do a hundred, Manther.”\n\nHe gazed ahead at the road unwinding before the wheels of the smoothly running car.\n\n“Yes, it can. Never had it wide open, though.” Manther said no more after that until the coupe slid into the cheap section on the outskirts of Centralia.\n\n“I suppose I’ll have to go to the trial,” he said then. “Stand all that nasty mess. I’m glad Mother never lived to see all this hell.”\n\n“Money sure ruins a man if he gets too much of it,” Jim Toller said abstractedly. “Anythin’ can happen to a guy who drinks like your brother. Does things he doesn’t know he’s doin’. People sure must have taken advantage of him — gamblers, dames — “\n\n“Let’s not talk about him,” Roy Manther said sharply. “Haven’t I been through enough without that?”\n\n“Turn here,” the detective said suddenly. “It’s a short cut to the station, Manther.”\n\nObediently Roy Manther turned the car through a dark side street. It purred along over four blocks of a wide thoroughfare. Then Jim Toller indicated another turn. Up ahead was a big, white, illuminated globe, and on it was printed in black letters the word POLICE. Roy Manther braked the coupe, swung toward the curb and drew to a stop. The plainclothes man went into the station house with Manther at his side. All of the newspaper men in town seemed to be gathered around the sergeant’s desk.\n\n“Hello, Jim,” said the officer on duty behind the desk. He nodded to Roy Manther, waited for Toller to explain the man’s presence.\n\n“This is Roy Manther, Pat,” said Jim. The sergeant’s eyes swung toward the prisoner’s brother. “Want to see your brother, eh?”\n\n“No,” Detective Toller answered for Manther. His next statement electrified his hearers. “He’s come to confess to the murder of his father, Pat!”\n\nRoy Manther stiffened as though he had stepped on a live wire, swung startled eyes toward Jim Toller. Newspaper men gaped foolishly at the detective, then surged forward. A cop ripped out: “What did you say, Jim?” as though he could not credit his own hearing.\n\n“He’s crazy!” Roy Manther ground out. “The man’s out of his mind!”\n\n“Oh, yeah?” the plainclothes man drawled. He pulled the score card out of his pocket and tossed it to the sergeant’s desk. “Take a look at that, Pat. It’s been filled out with an indelible pencil. And it’s not blurred at all.”\n\n“I don’t get you, Jim,” responded Pat. “No? Well, I was listening to that game over the radio,” the detective declared. “It was raining pretty hard from the seventh inning on, over in Midville, and those stands ain’t covered. So why didn’t this score card get wet, unless a man was sitting in a car when he filled it out? A guy who listened in on the radio like I did. Catch on, Manther? That was a bad slip. You wet indelible lead and it smears.”\n\n“I still say you’re crazy, Toller,” Manther roared. “I can prove I was at that game. I’ve got a stub to prove it — a rain check. The man at the ticket office spoke to me when I went in. I know him, see? Get him here tomorrow and he’ll tell you! What’re you trying to pull, Toller?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nSmeared Lead\n\nJim Toller to the cops:\n\n“Watch him close, men,” he said, “while I explain to the gentleman what I mean. That score card put the skids under him — pointed out other slips. Sure — he went to the game. It’s only twenty miles to Midville, and the road is good. He could get there in that car of his in twenty-five minutes the way he drives. He could buy a ticket, go inside and get a score card, then leave. They open the gates an hour before the game time up there. He could get back to some spot near his father’s house in time to tune in on the game. He figured that out. Sat in his coupe listening and keeping score — with that pencil. Maybe his nerves were on edge and he forgot to take into account what water does to indelible lead. He didn’t know some of the cordite he took out of a shell fell on the floorboards of his car.”\n\n“That’s right, Jim,” a burly cop said. “That lead would’ve smeared if he was writin’ out in the rain. It sure was raining pitchforks.”\n\n“You can’t frame me, Toller!” Roy Manther snarled. “You and your guessin’ game. You’ll sweat for this. You’ll be walking a beat again before the week’s out. Of all the wild, crazy — “\n\nDespite his blustering, Roy Manther’s upper lip was beaded with sweat and there was a drawn, blue look about the corners of his mouth.\n\n“Oh, I’ll tell you more, Manther,” Jim Toller hammered the man relentlessly. “You said that your brother came up from the gate-house and killed your father. Maybe. But there was dust on the window sill he was supposed to have climbed through, and it wasn’t disturbed! No wonder your father fired the housekeeper. But that wasn’t the payoff, Manther. It was the cartridge you fired in that thirty-eight. Yeah — the shell you fired! You had it figured out a long way ahead. You knew an expert pistol shot would be blamed for it — your brother!\n\n“You emptied a lot of cordite out of that shell while you were in that coupé of yours and put wadding in to compensate for it. Then you put the bullet back in it again. That’s why the bullet only went inside your father’s head a little more than an inch. But you forgot that that wadding came out, too. It proves to me and everybody else that your father was killed by a man who stood close to him! If that pistol had been fired from where you tried to make me believe it had been, the wadding would not have gone right in your father’s lap.”\n\nRoy Manther seemed to be shrinking inside his clothes. His demeanor had changed from defiance to panic. Fear was in his eyes now, and the color had receded from his face. In desperation he forced a jerky laugh.\n\n“After you killed your father,” Jim Toller said, “you wiped the prints off Ted Manther’s gun and carried it down to the cottage to plant it in his hand. You most likely brought him that bottle of whiskey he almost finished, too. You planted some of that money you stole from the safe on him. How much did you keep, Manther? You worked fast. You hurried to where you left your car and drove toward Midville because you knew that traffic would be heavy with all the fans coming home from the game and nobody would think anything about another car coming out of a filling station and heading right back from the direction it had come. You drove right back home, and it took you a little more than an hour. It all figures up by the clock!\n\n“You left your lights burning in that roadster when you got to the house because you knew what you were going to find. Ordinarily you would have put it in the garage for the night. Anyway, under normal circumstances, you would have turned out the lights. It meant that you had jittery nerves even before you found your father’s body. You wanted money, Manther. Some of it quick. The rest when your father’s affairs were settled. Come clean, Manther. You think a man with a terrible hangover could have figured all that out? You think that even a crack pistol shot wouldn’t have pretty shaky hands after being on a bender for a couple of days? You think he would bother about fixing a shell so that — “\n\n“Dead to rights,” a newspaper man clipped suddenly.\n\nRoy Manther broke. He dropped his head in his hands and reeled against the wall.\n\nJim Toller went on: “I’m guessing he spent a lot of money, too. Not with cheap bookies and gamblers like his brother, but with big-shot clubmen and society card sharks. He was a rat, too, but he had his fur polished. Did I figure right, Manther? And here’s another angle in case you haven’t enough already. I looked at the dial of your radio set in that coupe, and the arrow is turned to that little one-horse Centralia station, WXYB. Now why would you have it turned there with all those big stations putting out nice music? Figured it would be pretty easy hanging it onto your brother — with the rep he’s made for himself, huh ? Put him in the cooler, Pat. He looks too sick to stand up.”\n\n“Damn you! You snooping louse! You — “ Roy Manther choked on the epithets he called the detective.\n\n“I bet the commissioner won’t call me them names,” Jim Toller grinned. “Well, you see you can’t always judge a book by its cover, boys!”\n\nThe newshawks were already scrambling for possession of two telephone booths. Jim Toller grinned as he leaned against the desk and watched the cops take a fear-ridden man into the cell room and saw them bring a bewildered one out.\n\n“Sometimes things are too obvious even to a dumb dick like me,” Jim Toller said to the desk sergeant. “Manther puts that score card right where I can look at it when we get up to the house, Pat. Hands me an alibi and I ain’t even asked for it. And how many guys keep score cards? You know, this detective business is a soft racket sometimes, don’t you think?”\n\nTHE END\n"

The condition of the body, he said, proved his contention. Then, too, the fact that the blood with which the sheets were smeared had dried and hardened caused him to stick to his statement.\n\nYet Orville Hitchens, Fellows’ secretary, swore that his employer had been alive and well at two o’clock in the morning.\n\nHitchens stated that he had been summoned by Fellows at one o’clock and requested to drive to Amboy, two miles away, for some bromide. Mr. Fellows had been extremely nervous of late and found himself unable to sleep. Finding that he had no bromide—a drug that he was accustomed to taking—he had awakened the secretary. Hitchens asserted that he had taken the light car, made the trip and returned just before the clock struck two. Fellows had taken a dose of the drug and Hitchens had again retired.\n\nHenry Phelps, the drug clerk, verified Hitchens’ statement as to the purchase of the bromide, while Landes, the chauffeur, told of getting out the light car for the secretary, who had driven it himself.\n\nIn spite of this Doctor Andrews stuck to his statement that the murdered man had been dead at least ten hours when he made his examination. Swenson, the valet, had discovered the murder when he went to awaken his master at eight o’clock.\n\nIt was nearly ten o’clock when Coroner Stevenson arrived, accompanied by Doctor Andrews and Bram Dwyer, the New York detective, who, with myself was spending a few days’ vacation in the little village. The prominence of the murdered man, coupled with the fact that the detective and Stevenson were old friends, caused the New Yorker to interest himself in the case at the latter’s request.\n\nFellows was a gentleman farmer—a man worth several millions of dollars made in Wall Street; who, tired of life in the city, had purchased Samoset Farm just at the edge of Amboy township and, after stocking it with the finest blooded cattle and horses that money could buy, had settled down to a life of rustic-bliss. As time passed he had added to his acreage by purchasing adjoining farms until half the township was his.\n\nHe had erected a mansion around which he had built smaller homes for his employees. These with the great barns, sheds for the machinery, dairy and offices made Samoset Farm almost a small town.\n\nSuch a man as Waldo Fellows set down in the midst of a rural community is bound to be sought out by his fellow-men. Twice he had reluctantly allowed himself to represent his district in the State Legislature. The Governor’s chair could have been his for the asking. His fellow-townsmen loved him for the nobility of his character. Yet he had enemies by the score—many of them the small landowners whose farms surrounded his. For the man who does things on a big scale is certain sooner or later to tramp on the toes of others. But who among those he had offended hated him to the extent of taking his life?\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Bottle of Bromide\n\nFellows was murdered in bed, apparently in cold blood, for there was no evidence of a struggle of any kind. Nothing in the room had been disturbed. So far as could be ascertained nothing of value had been taken. The fact that the bedding was not mussed led to the belief that the murderer had struck while his victim was asleep.\n\nNone of the servants nor Mrs. Fellows—who slept just across the hall—had heard any noise save when Hitchens returned from the drug store with the drug which Fellows had requested. Mrs. Fellows had called over the transom to Hitchens to ask what was the matter and he had told her of his employer’s sleeplessness.\n\nThe bottle of bromide with a small quantity gone was found on the table beside the bed. Bromide seldom acts inside of half to three-quarters of an hour. Hence, assuming that Hitchens had told the truth—and everything pointed to his having done so—Fellows must, if he was killed in his sleep, have met death not earlier than three o’clock.\n\nYet the blood which had flowed from the wound, the condition of the body— everything—led a cool, conservative medical man to declare that death had struck at least three hours earlier. Nor could his testimony be shaken.\n\nThere were twelve servants who slept in the house, all occupying the upper floor, with the exception of Hitchens, Marie, Mrs. Fellows’ maid, and Swenson, the valet.\n\nWatson, the butler and general man about the house, was the last person to bed and, according to his own statement, the first up in the morning. He had personally locked all the doors and windows on the first floor. They were all locked when he made his rounds in the morning.\n\nHitchens, in going to the drug store, had left the house by the side door. This he had left unlocked, relocking it upon his return. This led to the assumption on the part of some of the officials that the murderer had entered the place by that door during the secretary’s absence, hiding until his return, and after Fellows was asleep had struck the fatal blow and escaped by the same door, springing the lock after him.\n\nThere was no other way of looking at the matter unless one went on the theory that the deed had been committed by one of the servants or Mrs. Fellows. And the latter was unthinkable, while the servants, all of them had been in Fellows’ employ for years and were known to be absolutely loyal.\n\nOf course the windows of the sleeping rooms on the second floor were open. A man of agility might have gained an entrance in this way. But luckily there had been a slight rainfall earlier in the evening and, as a result, the ground was in a condition to take impressions easily. The coroner and the sheriff made a thorough search for marks of a ladder or footprints, but were positive that there was none beneath any of the windows.\n\nAnd there was always to be considered the lack of motive. Aside from the farmers who were jealous of the big landowner there was no one known to hold a grudge against him.\n\nMy friend Dwyer declined to assist the officials in their hunt for footprints, contenting himself with dawdling about the house as if greatly bored with the whole affair. Conversant as I am with his methods, I admit that this surprised me, for he is usually energy personified when there is some perplexing problem to be untangled. Eventually, however, the officials, nonplussed, were forced to turn to him for advice. He answered with a shrug of his shoulders, absolutely refusing to be drawn into a discussion of the case.\n\nFollowing the time-worn methods, the sheriff called all of the servants together and examined them, eliciting no more information than had already been gained. It was at this point that Dwyer, who had listened to the questioning without comment, offered a suggestion:\n\n“There’s a band of gypsies camped a few miles the other side of town,” he remarked quietly. “Their chief is old Father Lipki, a friend of mine. The old fellow knows his business from the ground up—fortune telling, mind reading and all of that sort of stuff. In fact, he’s assisted me on more than one occasion. I know that you’ll laugh at me for the suggestion, but let me bring him here. I’ll guarantee that he’ll have the murderer by the heels inside of half an hour. How he does it I don’t pretend to know. It’s positively uncanny, the way he pulls off his stunts. But if it’s results you want, then Lipki is your man.”\n\nThe sheriff sneered. Coroner Stevenson, in spite of his friendship for the detective, suppressed a smile with difficulty.\n\n“You don’t want us to think that you believe in such rot, do you, Bram?” he inquired.\n\nMy friend shrugged his shoulders again.\n\n“You asked for my opinion,” he answered. “I’m giving it to you. I’ll take a chance on Father Lipki. In fact, as I have stated, I have many a time. The man has powers beyond the understanding of men like us. But of course it’s up to you and the sheriff.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nFather Lipki\n\nDarkness had fallen when Dwyer and the coroner again drove up to the Fellows home accompanied by Father Lipki, the gypsy.\n\nA typical member of his race was Lipki, a wrinkled little figure far past the age allotted to man. But in spite of his years he carried himself like a youth of twenty and his black, beady eyes glittered like those of a boy as he prepared the stage for the affair, his huge brass earrings rattling like castanets as he hurried here and there.\n\nThe spot selected by the coroner, upon the advice of Dwyer, for the test of Lipki’s powers was the huge living room on the lower floor. The servants were ordered to carry out all of the furniture with the exception of the chairs, which were arranged along the wall. Then every member of the household with the exception of the widow was ordered to be present.\n\nThe old man, mumbling to himself, drew a large circle on the floor in the center of the room with a piece of charcoal, after which he commanded us to seat ourselves just outside the circular mark, warning us under penalty of death not to enter the circle unless commanded to do so by him.\n\nHis next act was to produce a brazier, which he lighted and placed in the center of the circle. By its side he placed a small vessel containing water.\n\nThe lights were then turned out. For an instant we were in darkness. Then the brazier flamed up, filling the room with an unearthly bluish-greenish sort of glare. Chanting to himself, the old man threw a pinch of powder into the flames at intervals; the light would turn for a second into a vivid red, then die away again to the dull, sickly bluish-green.\n\nSuddenly he seated himself cross-egged at the side of the brazier and bowed his head. Closing his eyes as if in prayer, he mumbled to himself in an unintelligible jargon. I confess to a feeling of nervousness; I could tell from the expression on their faces that the others were the same.\n\nThe tension was becoming almost unbearable when the old man slowly raised himself to a standing position and, seizing the vessel of water, sprinkled it on the floor inside the circle, being extremely careful that not a single drop fell outside the mark.\n\n“I must protect you from the powers of evil!” he explained.\n\nKeeping carefully inside the mark, he made the rounds, touching each of us lightly on the forehead, making on each of us the sign of the cross.\n\n“In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost!” I heard him mumble to himself.\n\nReseating himself on the floor, he again bowed his head and once more his lips moved as if in prayer. Suddenly he fell over and for several minutes writhed about as if in terrific pain. I leaped to my feet to assist him, but the strong hand of Bram Dwyer held me back.\n\n“Remember!” he shouted. “The old man commanded us, regardless of what happened, not to cross the line!”\n\nAfter three or four minutes the spasms ceased and the gypsy seemingly none the worse for his experience arose and addressed us:\n\n“My friends,” he commenced in his halting, broken English, “you have asked me here to use my arts in the detection of one who has committed a crime—the crime of murder. I have done my best. Inside this circle have I wrestled with the powers of darkness and the spirits of light. I know not which one of you committed this foul deed. No one knows save God.\n\n“Yet He who created all things will not allow the crime of murder to pass unnoticed. Therefore I say unto you this:\n\n“If he who committed this crime is in this room there will appear upon his forehead the sign of the cross — the mark that God placed upon Cain! This alone can I do. More than that I am not allowed, for my powers are limited.”\n\nHe signaled for Dwyer to turn on the lights. An instant later we were blinking at the unaccustomed brightness. The old man seized the brazier and held it close to the face of each of us, gazing into our eyes as if seeking to read there the secret he was bent upon obtaining.\n\nThen came a shriek! A gasp of astonishment—of horror! A cry! I turned my head, my eyes following the gaze of the others.\n\nUpon the forehead of Hitchens was the sign of the cross!\n\nFor a second there was silence—cold, oppressive silence. The secretary gazed from one to another of us mutely, questioningly. Then his eyes sought the mirror above the fireplace. Afterward I recalled that Dwyer had seated him in front of the glass. His face became drawn. The sweat stood out on his forehead in great beads.\n\nSlowly, as if stunned, his fingers sought the accursed mark upon his forehead. He spat upon his hand and rubbed the spittle across the spot as if to erase it. He held the tips of his fingers in front of his eyes, surveying them thoughtfully, dazed.\n\nThen, without warning, he dropped to his knees, his arms outstretched towards the swarthy man within the circle.\n\n“I did it! I did it!” he shrieked.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nAmmonium Chloride\n\n“No, I never met Lipki until yesterday,” Dwyer chuckled to us as, two hours later, Hitchens safely lodged in jail, he sat with the coroner, the sheriff and myself in the former’s parlor and went over the various phases of the case.\n\n“I’m a fairly good judge of character and when I noticed him begging on Main Street yesterday I immediately placed the old fellow as being far above the average of his class mentally and capable of playing almost any part he might be called upon to take. 1 realized far better than the rest of you that the murderer was too clever to be captured unless some subterfuge was used and when you appealed to me, Stevenson, my thoughts reverted at once to the old man. A falsehood or two in the interests of justice is, in my opinion, perfectly allowable. And that I was correct in my estimate is proved by what happened.\n\n“What appealed to me from the very start was the apparent lack of motive. Had we been able to supply a motive we might have been able to have laid our hands on the man who struck the blow. But in the absence of one, it became necessary to take some radical step. To imagine that one of the farmers hereabouts would become jealous enough to strike Fellows down was absurd. And, granting that some of them might have the nerve, they lacked the imagination to pull off so mysterious a crime.\n\n“I was confident in my own mind that Hitchens was the guilty party. Why? Because he was the only man who had an opportunity to kill Fellows. But, on the other hand, his frank statements apparently eliminated him from the suspects.\n\n“Let us analyze the affair a trifle deeper: Doctor Andrews swears that Fellows was killed shortly after midnight. We now know that he was correct. But Hitchens bobs up with the story of being in conversation with the murdered man at two o’clock. He was able to prove his statements why two reputable and disinterested witnesses—Landes, the chauffeur, and Phelps, the drug clerk. Therefore my conclusion was that either Hitchens was lying or that the physician was wrong. But my experience has taught me that medical men are, as a general pule, cold-blooded —that is, they figure things out with mathematical accuracy and by the law of averages, they are right ninety-nine times out of a hundred. Therefore Hitchens was lying. But so far as we knew there was no motive.\n\n“Now, the average man has deep within him a streak of superstition and a fear of whatever he does not understand. Therefore I took the indolent attitude before the servants, finally working things up to a climax so that they expected wonderful things from the gypsy whom I had touted so highly. As soon as you gave your permission I hunted up the old man, whose name, by the way, is not Lipki, but Rodereigo. For ten dollars he agreed to play the part the way I told him to—and that he sustained my estimate of him I believe you will all agree. I spent the afternoon in coaching him.\n\n“I felt that, in case Hitchens did not confess, we would have lost nothing. But I was betting on the superstitious streak in his makeup and won out.\n\n“We all know now what his motive was. He had been systematically robbing his employer for years. Fellows had become suspicious and last night notified the secretary that they would go over the books together today. Hitchens waited until his employer was sleeping, then entered the room by means of a key that he had secured possession of, struck the fatal blow, then went through the mummery of going to the village after the bromide, thus providing himself with an almost perfect alibi. With Fellows dead, he figured that, as confidential man, he would be retained for a year or two to come, finally reaching a point where he could get his hands on a large sum of money and make his escape before his defalcations were discovered.”\n\n“But,” rumbled the sheriff, “I’m still in the dark as to how the gypsy caused that black cross to appear on his forehead just by mumbling a few prayers. Those people know a lot of black art that we more civilized people will never be able to understand.”\n\nDwyer grinned. “I furnished the ‘black art’ myself,” he answered. “It cost me ten cents at the drug store. The old man made the cross on Hitchens’ forehead first, if you will recall the affair. He had just dipped his hand into the vessel of what looked like water. He only pretended to dip his hand into it when he anointed the rest of you. The heat of the brazier brought out the mark—or started it— when he held it up and pretended to peer into your faces.\n\n“What was it? Merely a ten percent solution of ammonium chloride— the same stuff from which invisible ink is made. The old man’s skin being dark, it didn’t come—out on his hand as it did on Hitchens’ forehead. And that’s the whole story.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

The two men at the table near the door were the only patrons in Luigi&#39;s restaurant. They had eaten and were sitting there drinking wine. They drank very slowly and it was plain that they were waiting for somebody because they weren&#39;t talking much and had the half bored, half impatient look of people who have nothing to do but wait. At a table near the back of the room the waiter, who seemed to be the only one on duty, sat smoking a black twisted cigar and reading a newspaper.\n\nOne of the men put his wine glass down and lit a cigarette. Even sitting down he was noticeably shorter than his companion but he was powerfully built. He had a deep olive complexion and eyes that were black and sparkling.\n\n&quot;It looks like your man isn&#39;t coming, Dan,&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that, Gatti,&quot; Dan said. &quot;He&#39;ll turn up. He knows the trail&#39;s hot and he&#39;d rather be a live rat than a dead kidnapper.&quot;\n\nGatti shook his head slowly.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he said vaguely. &quot;You say you&#39;ll know if it&#39;s the same one that phoned. How can you be sure?&quot;\n\n&quot;The accent. It&#39;s unmistakable. A deep voice and an accent like a vaudeville dialectician&#39;s.&quot;\n\nGatti refilled their glasses from the green bottle on the table. Then they were silent.\n\nThe front door opened and two men entered. One was fat with a complexion the color of old weather beaten brick and eyes that were watery and cold. He wore a high crowned, pearl grey fedora, set squarely on his head and his fleecy coat had heavily padded shoulders. The other man was slight and sallow. His coat was too tight across his back and he walked with a defiant swagger. They hung their hats and coats on the rack and sat down two tables away from the one at which Dan and Gatti were sitting. The waiter put down his cigar and came to their table, bowing slightly.\n\n&quot;Spaghetti wid&#39; a meat sauce,&quot; the stout man ordered loudly, &quot;an&#39; a bottle a&#39; Chianti.&quot;\n\n&quot;Same,&quot; the small man said laconically.\n\nThe waiter went off without a word. The two men lit cigarettes. Dan and Gatti watched them with open curiosity, waiting for some sign but they smoked in silence, never looking in the direction of the other table.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s the organ grinder accent all right,&quot; Gatti said in a barely audible voice. &quot;But where&#39;s the high sign?&quot;\n\n&quot;Give him a chance,&quot; Dan mumbled. &quot;He has to be plenty careful, I suppose.&quot;\n\nThe waiter came in with a wicker wrapped bottle which he set on the table before the newcomers. Then he went back to the kitchen and when he returned he brought two heaping plates of spaghetti, dripping reddish brown sauce and giving off a fragrant steam.\n\n&quot;The idea is to talk on a full stomach, I suppose,&quot; Gatti whispered. &quot;Or isn&#39;t he the guy? I thought your man was coming alone.&quot;\n\n&quot;He didn&#39;t say,&quot; Dan said.\n\nGatti watched the fat, red faced man wielding fork and knife, eating the spaghetti with great relish.\n\n&quot;Dat&#39;s a pretty good a&#39; spaghetti, eh Joe?&quot; the fat man said loudly.\n\n&quot;Right,&quot; Joe replied briefly.\n\nDan looked toward the back of the room where the waiter was again occupied with his cigar and paper. Maybe they&#39;re waiting for the waiter to clear out first, he was thinking. He sipped at his wine, waiting … Then he looked up again.\n\nThe stout man had almost finished, what was on his plate and was taking a long drink from his wine glass. He put the glass down and sat back in his chair. He turned his watery eyes on Dan and nodded his head slowly up and down … up and down.\n\nDan glanced quickly at Gatti who had his elbow on the table and seemed to be sleepily leaning far over to one side of his chair. Then he nodded his head at the stout man just as the latter had done.\n\nThe next instant he was on the floor and somewhere over his head, repeated claps of thunder were bursting as if they would never cease and from the other table he heard a choked scream. His ears hurt in the silence that followed.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nYou Eat Spaghetti With A Fork And A Tablespoon\n\nWhen he rose from the floor Gatti, gun in hand, was already standing at the side of the two men who a little while before had been enjoying their spaghetti and were now dead. The waiter had disappeared. Don took a revolver from the lifeless hand of the small, sallow faced man. He looked at the chambers. All the cartridges were neatly in place.\n\n&quot;He never had a chance to use it,&quot; Gatti explained.\n\nThe door opened again. A man with his hat drawn down low over his eyes, stood in the doorway and looked wildly about at the dead men and at Dan and Gatti. Then he turned around frantically.\n\n&quot;Our man,&quot; Gatti cried.\n\nHe leaped forward, grabbed the fleeing man by the elbow and jerked him violently into the room.\n\n&quot;You wanted to see us,&quot; Gatti said. &quot;You phoned the lieutenant, didn&#39;t you?&quot;\n\nEvery feature of the man&#39;s face was distorted with terror. Gatti shook him.\n\n&quot;This is the lieutenant,&quot; he said pointing to Dan. &quot;What were you going to tell him?&quot;\n\nThe man was looking at the corpses with a slow, steady gaze. His face was more composed now.\n\n&quot;Sure,&quot; he said in a deep, resonant voice. &quot;Dey a&#39; deada now, yes? I no hava ta be afraid, yes?&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right, they&#39;re dead,&quot; Dan said. &quot;Where have they been keeping the kid?&quot;\n\nThe man drew a piece of paper from his pocket. Dan read the address on it and put it in his own pocket.\n\n&quot;Who are they?&quot; he asked pointing to the bodies.\n\nThe man was calm now.\n\n&quot;Dat&#39;s a&#39; Rocky Callahan,&quot; he said, &quot;an&#39;a da leetle wan he&#39;s a Joe Baker. I was a&#39; gon&#39; ta tell you. I was a&#39; gon&#39; ta—how you say—walk out on a&#39; dem.&quot;\n\n&quot;Rocky Callahan from Detroit!&quot; Dan said in surprise. &quot;You mean the fat feller.&quot;\n\n&quot;Dat&#39;s a&#39;right.&#39;&#39;\n\n&quot;Sucker,&quot; Gatti chuckled.\n\n&quot;Yeah,&quot; Dan said wryly. &quot;But what started the target practice?&quot;\n\n&quot;He pulled a rod on us,&quot; Gatti said.\n\n&quot;Who?&quot;\n\n&quot;Joe Baker, the little guy.&quot;\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t see it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure, because you weren&#39;t looking for it.&quot;\n\n&quot;I was looking at them.&quot;\n\n&quot;Baker had it under the table in the hand he wasn&#39;t eating with. You couldn&#39;t notice unless you bent down to look under the flap of their tablecloth. They must have found out their pal here was going to sing and figured he probably told us too much already. They counted on getting him later.&#39;&#39;\n\nDan nodded reflectively. &quot;But what I want to know,&quot; he said, &quot;is how you happened to be looking under their table.&quot;\n\nGatti chuckled some more.\n\n&quot;I was just making sure,&quot; he said. &quot;Guys named Callahan shouldn&#39;t try to eat spaghetti. He might have palmed off the accent but nobody with a real accent like that would cut up his spaghetti with a knife and pick up tiny pieces on his fork.&quot;\n\n&quot;What&#39;s wrong with that?&quot; Dan wanted to know.\n\nGatti gave him a look of contempt.\n\n&quot;You eat spaghetti with a fork and a tablespoon to help you wind it around the fork and you eat it full length or it isn&#39;t worth eating.&quot;\n\n&quot;You dam&#39; right,&quot; Gatti&#39;s prisoner put in belligerently. His fear and humility were completely gone now. &quot;Dat&#39;s a&#39; da only way ta eata him.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n"

Then she lunged through the said door and fell dead across my desk, and the ebony cat streaked away!\n\n&quot;Plain case of murder,&quot; said fizzy Police Inspector Gogalvatty, rolling his little piggy eyes into a glare of suspicion. &quot;Plain case of murder right here in the office of this dumb shamus who tries to make us believe she staggered into his presence with a .22-automatic slug under her left arm. Besides, if you heard the shot, why didn&#39;t you jump out of your chair instead of, as you say, waiting until too late?&quot;\n\nThey carted the blonde&#39;s body over to the morgue. Gogalvatty was moving about my office with a magnifying glass in his pudgy fist, hoping he&#39;d find something that would give my story the lie. &quot;It&#39;s a good thing you bumped her,&quot; he said, &quot;or I would have died for want of excitement; it&#39;s been dull so long.&quot;\n\n&quot;My dear friend, Gogalvatty,&quot; I said depreciatingly, &quot;I did not bump her. It&#39;s not a nice thing to say, to say there&#39;s anything good about a swell dame like that being bumped. I&#39;d like to know what there is good about it. And for the twentieth time within the small space of two hours I have said to you, my dear friend, Gogalvatty —  I did not kill the blonde beauty.&quot;\n\n&quot;You could have gotten rid of the gun,&quot; Gogalvatty tossed his two hundred and forty pounds of fat out of my Morris. &quot;You could&#39;ve dropped it out the window. You could&#39;ve — &quot;\n\n&quot;Swallowed it,&quot; I said, with dignified rancor. &quot;You, Gogalvatty, are an ass; you have big ears and a bray and a barnyard smell. Why don&#39;t you scram and let me find out in my own way why murder dropped in on me the very day my rent was due?&quot;\n\nGogalvatty and I were close friends. Business had been below zero the past five weeks. Murderers had stopped murdering; thieves had stopped thieving, and married folks had stopped stepping out on each other. Thus, at the precise moment my landlady, Edyth Widdle, was on her way to my office to collect two months&#39; back rent, my door was wrenched open by the dying young lady from\n\n&quot;Miss Waddle was your only visitor.&quot; Gogalvatty&#39;s little eyes were smaller than two lone peas on a big dinner plate. &quot;She was the only one who showed up right after the murder was committed by those running feet. Yet Miss Waddle did not see any feet; she did not see anyone running. She did not hear the girl scream. She did not even know there was a girl who had screamed in her building, until she walked in and found her lying across your desk.&quot;\n\n&quot;Her name is Widdle, not Waddle,&quot; I corrected Gogalvatty. &quot;Must I keep reminding you of that? Another thing, my dear Gogalvatty — she is called Twiddle by all her tenants, not Widdle.&quot;\n\n&quot;What&#39;s the difference?&quot; the fat genius snapped. &quot;Twiddle or Twaddle, Widdle or Waddle, it&#39;s all the same; she does not confirm your statement that a woman screamed in this building. Therefore you are definitely a suspect and I must warn you that anything you say may be used against you.&quot;\n\nI munched on a peanut, put the bag in my pocket and my topcoat over my arm. &quot;The proper place to begin your investigation is at the studio where the poor kid was booked to sing, and did sing, time after time, right into the hearts of millions of radio fans. Personally, I aim to begin at the morgue; and speaking of morgues — that&#39;s where you&#39;ll wind up if you insist on being a dumb jackass and not bringing your brains home from their extended vacation.&quot;\n\nHe followed me out into the narrow hall. I locked the door, buttoned my coat and marched to the lift. Old Georgie, the elevator boy some sixty-odd years of age, was waiting; he slammed the cage door, rolled his eyes and said, in a hoarse voice:\n\n&quot;Zickety Zam, there&#39;s that black witch&#39;s cat — !&quot;\n\nScrooged up in a corner of the rattling lift was a black Tom. His eyes were like sapphires. His back was arched, and he was watching me with a suspicious gleam in his jungle orb, until I reached down gently, and spoke to him, and picked him up. He didn&#39;t sing; he spat a couple of times; but he didn&#39;t claw. Georgie sighed heavily.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Body of Ruth Cardova\n\nI dropped the Tom off at my apartment. I got him a big bowl of milk out of the icebox, patted his head, removed the thin leather collar from around his neck and put it in a bureau drawer, then rushed back to my sedan, headed for the city morgue up Edmond Street, and marveled at the beauty of the first snowfall of the year.\n\nOld Ben&#39;s lumbago was at its peak on this day that was so unconducive to bodily comfort. Between cursing his pains and impudence, he managed to clump his way down the iron steps without dying for want of breath. He conducted me to the big storage room, where a white light shone against a white ceiling, and yanked out a crypt. He pulled it all the way out, and the rollers sounded like the beating of bat wings in pitch darkness.\n\nJust as I bent over the poor kid to see the wound, scuffing heels raked down the iron stairs. &quot;Reporters?&quot; Ben muttered. &quot;Them guys will be the death of me yet.&quot;\n\nAs long as I had known Ben he was always on the verge of dying. But he was as healthy as any sound man his age.\n\nHe turned away, moved his bent form to the door, pulled it shut behind him. Alone with Ruth Cardova, I inspected the wound with the impartiality of a veteran flatfoot. There were no powder burns. The bullet had entered underneath her left arm. The tiny puckered blue hole did not seem capable of causing death; but that was an illusion, of course.\n\n&quot;Strikes me,&quot; I thought, &quot;that she was shot as she passed the hidden killer, maybe as she passed an open door. Either that or the culprit was walking beside her. But if such was the way it happened, then there would be powder burns. The corridors of the Ballanger Building are narrow. It isn&#39;t necessary to think she was shot by someone in one of those rooms she passed. Maybe there was a loiterer in the hall. Nope —  that&#39;s out. On account of the narrow width of the corridor, there would be powder burns around the wound. Only by standing inside an open door could the culprit shoot her without leaving those burns in the flesh or on the clothing.&quot;\n\nThe sound of low voices disturbed me. I drew the sheet over the girl&#39;s fcace, observing a certain peculiar hardness around the eyes. In death when the features are relaxed, you find traces that reveal plainer than words certain characteristics.\n\nThree men entered the room. Old Ben; Dave Cassidy, a leg man for the Chronicle who, on the side wrote an interesting column; and Tom Farris, production engineer for KVX.\n\nThere was nothing particularly striking about these men. Cassidy was short, wide and neatly dressed in a brand new tweed coat over a chalk striped blue suit. He wore a black necktie on a white shirt, and a black hat with the brim turned down all the way around. He was graying slightly at the temples, had a small, puffed mouth and a dimple in a stubborn chin; I could imagine Cassidy getting real fat by the time he was fifty.\n\nThomas Farris was a writer of soap operas. He was tall, sandy and balding. He wore glasses with heavy gold rim and thick lenses. He was clad in tweeds, even to a tweed topcoat, a black Flomburg and a pale blue shirt with a wine colored tie. His shoes were broad, oxblood, and his gloves were black knitted wool. He was about forty years old.\n\nFarris nodded; Cassidy frowned, and old Ben swore under his breath. None of them spoke to me. I stalled near the door, until they had looked at Ruth Cardova. Gogalvatty was coming down the iron steps, with elephantine grace, in a black derby, a plaid brown topcoat that was as big as a circus tent, and carrying a brief case under one arm.\n\nShe had no lovers; when she was killed she was being starred in a soap opera by Farris.\n\n***\n\nGogalvatty horned in, &quot;Where did Ruth Cardova come from?&quot;\n\n&quot;A little town west of here called Cameron,&quot; Farris said. &quot;She&#39;d been with us about a year. She wasn&#39;t the kind to run around. I had her out to night clubs a few times, and she&#39;d never take more than one highball; at the most two. She was greatly ambitious — vowed to make the hometown folks sit up and take notice, because she thought they&#39;d been unjust in their criticism of her. They&#39;d called her stage-struck, the usual things a small town says about a girl with lofty ideas.&quot;\n\n&quot;She didn&#39;t have no boy friends hanging around?&quot; Gogalvatty expostulated. &quot;You sure she didn&#39;t have no lovers, Farris?&quot;\n\nFarris flinched, his hands shook a little. He was a nervous man, and his cigar had gone out. &quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; he said; he kept his voice down. &quot;Of course we all made a play for her; I admit it. Even Cassidy took her out. But none of us was serious, if that&#39;s what you mean.&quot;\n\n&quot;She wouldn&#39;t play.&quot; Fat Gogalvatty made a wry face. &quot;She wouldn&#39;t play at all?&quot;\n\n&quot;She was very quiet.&quot; Farris looked at me, shrugged. I felt sorry for him. Gogalvatty was an ass. Gogalvatty was a fat monkey; he needed his nose punched. He was criminally sadistic.\n\nGogalvatty smiled. &quot;She had a reason for going to see this mule-faced shamus. She wanted to hire him. She was either afraid of being murdered, or she was afraid of something else.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;d like to know,&quot; said Cassidy, who up to now hadn&#39;t said a word. &quot;What took her to Beckett&#39;s office?&quot;\n\n&quot;And,&quot; Gogalvatty supplied cunningly, &quot;who in the heck knew she was going to see him? And who killed her to keep her from talking?&quot;\n\nFarris sighed, stamped his cigar out on the stone floor. &quot;I do not know how to answer your questions,&quot; he said coldly. &quot;If I did, it would make me very happy.&quot;\n\n***\n\nOn my way back to my office, I had time to do some hard thinking. Although I didn&#39;t expect to get a fee out of my work, I meant to do my utmost to solve the mystery. I knew Gogalvatty hoped to pin the crime on me. He was an ambitious donkey and didn&#39;t let a little thing like friendship stand in his way.\n\nI began to have an uneasy feeling, like maybe someone was following and watching me, with a sinister purpose in mind. I could imagine a shadow falling aslant my path, a dark, hooded shadow whose eyes gleamed with anticipation. I don&#39;t know where I got the idea, but it actually caused a cold sweat to break out on my face. I was used to doing the shadowing and not being shadowed.\n\nI put in a long distance call. Ten minutes later I had Ruth Cardova&#39;s father on the phone. He&#39;d already learned of his daughter&#39;s demise and in his voice was his deep grief.\n\nI learned one thing of importance to the investigation. Ruth had written home that barring misfortune she would be able to prevent the foreclosure on her father&#39;s business. It seemed he was facing ruin. Due to the war he&#39;d been unable to get new cars to keep his auto agency going. He&#39;d held on until he was heavily in debt. It would require an even five grand to put him back on his feet; this sum Ruth had promised she would raise. No doubt she&#39;d had a loan in mind.\n\nFor a while I sat munching peanuts, the salty kind. It seemed Ruth Cardova had been a loyal little person. at least where her father was concerned. But I figured she&#39;d been trying to borrow the money from the wrong man. Suddenly I thought of something, called Inspector Gogalvatty:\n\n&quot;Did you look in her purse?&quot; I asked.\n\n&quot;Sure — there&#39;s five grand in it. Five one thousand dollar bills.&quot; I almost fell out of my chair.&quot;\n\n&quot;What would a gal be doing with that much money?&quot; I asked.\n\n&quot;It ain&#39;t exactly cornfodder,&quot; he said. &quot;When I come to think of it, you&#39;re the only one who knows what happened in your office. I should&#39;ve arrested you hours ago.&quot;\n\n&quot;If I killed her&quot; I said, &quot;I could&#39;ve paid my rent. As it is, I owe two months and I&#39;m going to have to move.&quot;\n\n&quot;Which is neither here nor there&quot; he rapped. &quot;If I can hang Ruth Cardova&#39;s murder on you — &quot;\n\nI heard a furtive sound behind me, muttered quickly, &quot;I mightn&#39;t live that long&quot; and cradled the phone. Just then the atomic bomb dropped on my head, exploded and blew me into little bitsy pieces.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThey Knew She Had The Money\n\nSlowly I picked myself together, put the pieces all back in place, crawled to my knees, then to my brogans and groped along the wall for the cupboard where I kept my whiskey. A deep charge of Scotch and I was able to take cognizance of the situation. A lump on my head as big as a goose egg showed where the bomb had landed but there was no cut place in my scalp and I figured I&#39;d been hit with a flat-blackjack, flat because of the shape of the mountain.\n\nMy desk had been ransacked. The rug in the front room was a mess. They&#39;d even looked in the geranium pots for whatever it was they&#39;d looked for. And my desk had been moved at least four feet; on the floor lay the blue advertising blotter.\n\n&quot;The money&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;They knew she had the money and reasoned that I robbed her before the police came. Somebody knew she had that five grand — !&quot;\n\nI whistled, decided not to report the matter to the police and about twenty minutes later I was seated in a glass room, surrounded by mikes, filing-cabinets and other accessories that usually litter up a radio production engineer&#39;s office. Tom Farris had before him a stack of manuscripts, and he&#39;d been working hard because his face glistened with sweat. But the room was none too warm to suit me.\n\n&quot;I just dropped around to chat a moment on a new angle,&quot; I said. In a deep chrome and red-leather chair I lit a cigarette.\n\n&quot;Glad you did,&quot; he said. &quot;Gives me a chance to leave off work. I&#39;ve been hard at it in here for an hour and a half, writing the latest episode of She Lost Him Because She Loved Him.&quot;\n\nBut I observed that the sweat dried quickly on his face and this made me wonder how he&#39;d worked himself up to that lather in a room as cool as this one. I pulled the ashtray toward me. &quot;Would you mind telling me how much salary Ruth Cardova was paid by your company?&quot;\n\n&quot;Not at all,&quot; he said. &quot;One hundred a week, with a raise coming up the day she was twenty-five, which would be next Tuesday.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why that?&quot; I asked. &quot;What difference did it make about her age?&quot;\n\n&quot;Just a birthday present,&quot; he said. &quot;She was twenty-four, nearing twenty-five and she spoke about it a lot, what she&#39;d like to have when she was twenty-five.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, yes, of course,&quot; I said. &quot;A hundred a week. It would take a long time to save five grand. Did she have any money, Farris?&quot;\n\n&quot;Not much,&quot; he said. &quot;I think she was sending home all she could spare. But I never heard her say. It cost her a good deal to live, the way she lived — I&#39;d say around two hundred a month for her Plaza apartment, not to mention the cost of her wardrobe and other things.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure, I see.&quot; I got up, went to the window and gazed out at the snow flakes swirling around a nearby church steeple and falling on the already white city. &quot;Did she try to borrow from you?&quot; I asked, casually.\n\n&quot;Never,&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;Do you know anyone with whom she could have secured a loan?&quot;\n\n&quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;I do not.&quot;\n\nFor any girl making one hundred a week, borrowing five thousand dollars without security was next to impossible.\n\n&quot;I had a talk with her father tonight,&quot; I said suddenly. &quot;Over at the police station they have her purse and it shelters five one-thousand-dollar bills. Her father said she&#39;d promised to send that amount home if she succeeded in raising it, which she said she believed she could.&quot;\n\nFarris got up slowly and peered down at me. &quot;Beckett, it&#39;s funny where she got that money.&quot;\n\n&quot;You telling me?&quot; I rose and walked to the glass door. &quot;But I&#39;m quite sure the cops will make it their business to find out where she got it,&quot; I said. &quot;Well, good day, Farris.&quot;\n\n***\n\nA man came toward me through the blanket of snow as I approached my apartment which opened upon the sidewalk. I saw Dave Cassidy&#39;s blocky face and it was red; he&#39;d been drinking. I led the reporter down the steps of the sunken living room and asked him to take off his topcoat. He declined, didn&#39;t even remove his snow sprinkled hat.\n\nThe black cat was not in sight.\n\n&quot;I want to talk to you, Beckett.&quot; The fleshy reporter sat down. &quot;I think I&#39;ve got something that will help you find Ruth&#39;s murderer. I&#39;m not sure. What do you know about Edyth Widdle?&quot;\n\nI was making him a drink and paused, with the glass in my hand. I set the pink decanter down on the mantel. The fire was roseate in the soft table lamp.\n\n&quot;Edyth Widdle,&quot; I said, &quot;is my landlady. She owns the Ballanger Building. She is a tight-fisted, youngish woman, a miser who finds bargains and squeezes the eagle until it cries bloody murder. She&#39;d do anything for a dollar, and is the youngest and prettiest miser-lady in the Country. They say her father was like that before her.&quot;\n\nCassidy&#39;s red face flamed.\n\n&quot;Miss Widdle is a money lender,&quot; he said. &quot;For good security she will loan you any amount. But the security must be excellent. This afternoon I saw Widdle and Ruth Cardova at the Rendezvous on Edmond Street. This tightwad was spending money lavishly, and Ruth had two highballs. They both wore corduroy slacks and fur coats. From the Rendezvous they crossed the street to the Ballanger. That was thirty minutes before Ruth was killed.&quot;\n\n&quot;All right,&quot; I said. &quot;What about it? What ice does that cut?&quot;\n\n&quot;Only this.&quot; Cassidy took the glass out of my hand drained, it. &quot;Less than a month ago Widdle&#39;s office was entered and certain valuables left in her care as security for loans were taken. Mostly they were diamonds.&quot;\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t know that,&quot; I said. &quot;Anyhow I don&#39;t see the connection. I don&#39;t see what you&#39;re getting at.&quot;\n\n&quot;Okay,&quot; he said. &quot;Just let this percolate: In Ruth&#39;s purse at headquarters the cops found five one-thousand-dollar bills. I&#39;m guessing she got the money from this female Shylock because she returned her the stolen gems.&quot;\n\nI gasped. It was startling. I peered at the pink decanter on the mantel and thought how pretty the cerise light was on it. By no stretch of the imagination could I place Ruth Car- dova in the diamond robbery. &quot;You&#39;re out of your mind,&quot; I said.\n\nHe stared at me and his eyes flamed. &quot;Edyth Widdle has no license to do a pawnbroker&#39;s business. Think of the lawsuits that would follow her failure to return those valuables to their owners who demanded them and met their obligations to Widdle. Do you get what I mean now?&quot;\n\n&quot;In short,&quot; I said, &quot;our little small town heartthrob turned thief, then offers to return the securities if Miss Widdle will give her five grand.\n\n&quot;Beckett, you&#39;re a genius.&quot; He laughed jeeringly and set his glass down on the Turkish coffee table. &quot;You&#39;re a deep, quick thinker; you have got the solution now and there can&#39;t be any mistake.&quot;\n\n&quot;After paying Ruth five grand, Miss Widdle gets so mad she sees red, shoots Ruth and recovers the money. Is that it?&quot; It still didn&#39;t add up.\n\n&quot;Nope,&quot; I said, &quot;that is not the solution.&quot;\n\nCassidy straightened, rubbed his broad face. I followed him to the vestibule. He regarded me cynically. &quot;Inspector Gogalvatty suspects you of the murder,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#39;s going to arrest you, says you are the most logical suspect. Ruth had to be shot in your office, for it didn&#39;t occur in the hall or there would be powder burns. The hall is entirely too narrow.&quot;\n\nI heard him leave the house, went to the street door and watched him enter his car. The little street was filled with a deep hush. The church on the corner was majestic in the white silence. Cassidy&#39;s press car vanished and a curtain of snow fell behind it, leaving only pink lamps spearing out at me.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nMr. Tom\n\nI hurried through the house looking for the ebony cat and I found Mr. Tom, curled up on my bed, under the comforter. I did not disturb his deep slumber, but turned toward the door and stopped. There was a covert movement beyond the threshold. Then the room was filled with a blinding, volcanic explosion. The floor rushed up and smacked me in the face, and all the lamps went out.\n\nI crawled painfully back over a path littered with thorns. I got my hands on the bed, but didn&#39;t know it was the bed. I thought I was clinging to the wall of a precipitous cliff, and that there was a vast emptiness below me, and showing in the empty depths, far, far down there, so that I could barely see it, was something. There was a waterfall below me, the stream roaring like thunder and a seething mass of clutching trapping hands that tried to pull me down into the depths.\n\nI heard something cry out softly, and the bang of a door. The cat was glaring at me, his eyes brighter than any diamonds Ruth Cardova could ever have taken from Edyth Widdle, and he arched his back.\n\nNow I knew what it was all about, for the Tom was crawling out from under that comforter where he&#39;d been lying peacefully. A tiny clot of blood on my forehead showed where the bullet had grazed me, and the impact had momentarily knocked me out. I must have frightened away the burglar, because when I grabbed Tom and hurried out into the living room, with my automatic in my hand, the street door was open. Snow whirled and spun in a white magnificence on the vestibule rug.\n\nIt was about ten minutes later when I found Edyth Widdle&#39;s name in the phone directory and about ten minutes later when I got her on the wire. She was panting in the transmitter.\n\n&quot;Do you own a black tomcat?&quot; I asked. &quot;He answers to the name of Jo-Jo.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure I do,&quot; she said, and her voice had a lot of music and pieces of velvet in it. &quot;Who&#39;s this speaking?&quot;\n\n&quot;John Randolph Beckett,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#39;m one of your tenants.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re the private detective whose office is on the same floor with mine,&quot; she said. &quot;And you owe two months rent. Sure, I know. But what about my Jo-Jo?&quot;\n\n&quot;I gave him a bowl of cream,&quot; I said. &quot;He&#39;s all right. We&#39;ve gotten to be pretty good friends since I found him. Suppose you meet me at your office, and I&#39;ll fetch him along; I suppose you&#39;re willing to pay a reward?&quot;\n\n&quot;Possibly a small one,&quot; she said in a low voice. &quot;How soon?&quot;\n\n&quot;One hour,&quot; I said. &quot;It&#39;s pretty cold out and I want to make myself a cup of coffee before I tackle this storm.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll be waiting in my office,&quot; she said. &quot;You bring Jo-Jo. Don&#39;t you dare come without Jo-Jo, Beckett; if you do, I&#39;ll move you out into the street.&quot;\n\nThere was a strange anxiety in her voice.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nEdyth Widdle\n\nI knew what she looked like. A rangy brunette, with long slim hips and clad always in tweeds. She had a pale, high-cheekboned face, a shapely mouth that looked hungry all the time and a deep bosom that she kept down by tight brassieres. She was stronger and bigger of physique than she looked, but she was quite appealing, despite all that. I imagined she was just past 30 years of age. But she had never been married.\n\nI was beginning to see daylight. When Ruth Cardova ran into my office, she had Jo-Jo locked in her arms. I had just one question yet to answer. What was she doing with Edyth Widdle&#39;s tomcat?\n\nBut there was something else. I would get around to that later. The little matter of the attempt on my life and the slugging I got at the hands of the same nasty culprit, was still very fresh in my mind. I went back into the bedroom and saw the pieces of the picture of my hunting dogs smashed on the floor, broken by the bullet that had narrowly missed killing me.\n\nWhat did the nasty culprit want that I had in my possession or that he thought I had in my possession? Could it be — ?\n\nI ran to the bureau and dug out Jo-Jo&#39;s thin leather collar. Racing through my mind were certain clews which I was beginning to fit together. What, for instance, had Ruth Cardova been doing with Widdle&#39;s black tomcat?\n\nShe could have picked him up in the hall. No, that was out. I was sure she would not have picked up a stray cat.\n\nTwo: She had five grand in her purse when she was shot.\n\nThree: She was with Widdle at the Rendezvous where she had two highballs with the miserly young woman.\n\nFour: Edyth Widdle hadn&#39;t claimed her cat when she came to my office after the killing.\n\nFive: She&#39;d heard no gunshot, no woman scream.\n\nAnd six: Edyth Widdle was a money lender.\n\nI could&#39;ve gone on all night linking Widdle with the murder of the radio canary, but I&#39;m not a patient man. I pocketed the leather collar bearing the ebony cat&#39;s name on a thin brass plate, and headed for the Ballanger Building. I left the coveted cat behind, playing safe.\n\nThe storm was furious and there&#39;d been a drop of four degrees in temperature since I&#39;d gone home from my interview with Tom Farris, the playwright. I parked a block this side of the Ballanger, on Edmond near the Empire Bank. The clock over the sidewalk said ten o&#39;clock, straight up and down. The chimes began to tinkle musically as I clambered from my car. In the pocket of my trenchcoat was my automatic and the leather collar. The city&#39;s ermine coat was studded with gems.\n\nI was cautious as I entered the building. The lift had stopped running, and the vestibule was cold, with the steam turned low. I took the broad wooden steps. The Ballanger&#39;s an old building but a big one, and the staircase was steep. I crossed the landing slowly on the second floor, and soon the landing on the third, and finally reached the fourth. A light gleamed at the end of the hall. Beyond this the second door, in the elbow turn, was my office. I knew that Edyth Widdle&#39;s suite was the third door on my right as I started up the long corridor. A sudden flash of light gleamed on the fire-extinguisher; this warned me. I braked to a stop and reached for my gun.\n\nJust then a door opened and a square of saffron brilliance appeared just two jumps ahead of me, on my right. The door of Edyth Widdle&#39;s suite had been quietly opened.\n\nFlattened against the wall, I waited not breathing for fear I would be a target for a pistol gripped in a desperate hand. There came no disturbing sound, no sound at all. I edged along the wall, inching my way. When I reached the open door, I heard voices. I had arrived at my destination thirty minutes earlier than I had promised to be there. But the voices were muffled and I could make out none of the words; nor were they loud enough to be distinct so that I could recognize the speakers.\n\nBoldly now, the gun gripped in my hand I crossed the threshold. I saw nothing. The bright lamp blinded me. I made out a desk which stood facing the door, low, modernistic, with greenhouse flowers forming a bouquet in a big vase on the blotter. Just as I put my hands on the desk, the door behind me banged shut.\n\nThe next thing I knew I was fighting silently, and desperately, for my life!\n\n***\n\nMy hand, clutching the automatic, was pinned to my side before I could make use of the weapon. Somebody was fumbling with the front of my coat, and the buttons were torn away. I pushed this person back with my left hand, and strove hard to use the gun. I got away, but was followed closely by the man who&#39;d tried to disarm me. I saw him looming straight in front of me, lifted the gun quickly and squeezed the trigger. There was a blinding red flash and the explosion of the little automatic. The form that loomed in my startled eyes, stopped coming at me and began to run away on his heels. He must&#39;ve struck the desk hard, for the bouquet of flowers rolled off and crashed on the floor.\n\nI skewed about quickly, but could not see my other antagonist. But hands were on me now, and I knew that I was going to have a hard time getting away this time. Something brushed against my face, and I felt the warm silkiness of a woman&#39;s hair. Edyth Widdle!\n\nI don&#39;t know how she got hold of my wrist but she was so strong that she succeeded in twisting the automatic out of my hand. I heard it clunk on the rug. Then she must have tripped me, for we soon were rolling about on the floor. I felt the softness of her bosom, and the bareness of her, when she rolled up to sit down on me, and began to pound my head up and down on the floor. Only the thickness of the rug kept her from hammering my brains out through my skull.\n\nI reared up and found that she was heavy enough to keep me pinned. I tried to grasp her hands, her fingers being buried in my hair. I got hold of one wrist, and tried to loosen her hold on my hair, but failed. She kept bumping my head. I threw my left arm out and the back of my hand hit my lost gun. Quickly I closed my fingers upon it, pulled it to me, and by bending my elbow was able to get the weapon close against her side.\n\nToo late she discovered what I&#39;d done, and she shifted her hold to my throat. But I had the gun against her ribs now on the right side, and I gently pressed the trigger. The savage crash of the gun left everything still for an immeasurable interval, then I felt the softness of the woman harden, and stiffen and then she just rolled off on the floor, still with one heavy leg thrown across me.\n\nI scrambled to the phone, called headquarters. Gogalvatty answered. &quot;Okay,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;ll be over. But I hope they&#39;ve made mincemeat out of you by the time I get there.&quot;\n\nHe was sore because I&#39;d beaten him to the solution of the case. Funny how men who are big enough to hold jobs like this are just boys when it comes down to their personal feelings.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nTwiddle or Twaddle, Widdle or Waddle\n\nGogalvatty sat facing me across his desk. He toyed with the leather collar and pulled the black cat&#39;s ears. Tom seemed to enjoy it, but I didn&#39;t. He&#39;d held me there two hours, just talking and not saying anything new or fresh enough to hold my interest.\n\n&quot;Of course the credit for the solution goes to our friend, Cassidy,&quot; he said. &quot;Cassidy tipped you off and put your brain to working. You figured the rest out from the start he gave you; it didn&#39;t take a lot of sense to do that. Edyth Widdle wanted her jewels back, that Ruth Cardova stole. Ruth had seen where Widdle kept them in her desk, when she was there to get a small loan from the woman. Widdle didn&#39;t know she was the thief, and when Ruth approached her on the subject of recovering them for her, she promised to give Ruth five grand. She kept her word. Then she decided to get her money back, and as Ruth was leaving with the money, Widdle jumped her. The black cat was there and took a hand in the struggle. He must&#39;ve jumped into Ruth&#39;s face and she held him to keep him from clawing her. And she didn&#39;t put him down even after Widdle shot her.\n\n&quot;Ruth ran around the bend in the the hall, to your office. She knew you had an office there because when she stole the gems she looked around on the fourth floor. She figured you&#39;d protect her. She didn&#39;t know Widdle had wounded her fatally. Then Tom Farris, who was hooked up with Widdle in the money lending business, figured he&#39;d better get Widdle&#39;s black cat with the collar, away from you. He was in a tight spot, too.\n\nWhen he jumped you in the office he supposed you had the cat there, then when he tried to kill you in your apartment, he failed to find the cat that was sleeping under the comforter.&quot; He sighed. &quot;But I&#39;ll say one thing for that Widdle woman; she&#39;s not bad to look at, and when she gets well, I&#39;m going around to see her. Of course she&#39;ll get the chair, but I&#39;ll take her some flowers. You see, Miss Waddle is the only one who&#39;s ever given you a good heating.&quot;\n\n&quot;Her name&#39;s Widdle,&quot; I said. &quot;Not Waddle.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; croaked the fat genius, &quot;Twiddle or Twaddle, Widdle or Waddle, she has my sincerest best wishes for a quick recovery.\n\nI gave him a cussing, took Tom and went home.\n\n~ The End ~\n"

You see, I’m worried out of my mind.\n\nAnd the police — “\n\n“Suppose we begin at the beginning, Mr. Humphrey,” said the famous private detective gently. “I see from your card that you’re manager of the Tottenham Court Road branch of the Home Counties Bank.”\n\n“For the moment,” said Mr. Humphrey bitterly. “They’re going to transfer me any day now. As it is, the branch is being supervised by the inspection staff. After thirty years of service and experience, Mr. Hawke! That’s what riles me. They’ll put me back as a clerk again — and say I’m lucky to be so well treated!”\n\nThere was no doubt that the bank manager was in a very worried state of mind. His drawn face and his dark-ringed eyes showed clearly that he had not slept for nights.\n\n“I’ve had a customer at my branch, Mr. Hawke, for about eighteen months. A youngish man named Bernard Dobie. Well-spoken sort of fellow, always very pleasant. Neither my clerks nor myself have ever had any trouble with him. He seemed to have a private fortune of some twelve thousand pounds, which we kept for him — in cash.”\n\nDixon Hawke looked surprised.\n\n“A little unusual, surely? All that money, yet not invested?”\n\n“No, it wasn’t unusual in this case, for the simple reason that Dobie used to act as a sort of money-lender in West End circles. And sometimes he’d even go in for big-scale gambling. He was very shrewd, and he very rarely lost money — most times he made a handsome profit. He’d come in and draw a cheque for several thousands, and a few days or occasionally a month later he’d pay in a cheque for the same sum, plus a handsome percentage of profit.\n\n“He’d back some new theatrical show he had confidence in — or perhaps some new restaurant that was opening — that sort of thing. And his judgment was usually pretty sound.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Manager’s Misfortune\n\nMr. Humphrey sighed sadly.\n\n“Well, about a week ago — on September the seventh, to be accurate — he came in and wanted to draw the sum of nine thousand pounds. Naturally, a thing like that couldn’t be dealt with at the counter, and my cashier brought him into my office. He signed the cheque to self in front of us and we were able to secure the necessary money in hundred-pound notes within about twenty minutes. You understand, Mr. Hawke, that branches rarely carry big reserves of the higher-valued notes, but can get them delivered by messenger from other branches or from the City.\n\n“During the whole of that twenty minutes Bernard Dobie and I were talking together, I never suspected that anything was wrong. When the notes were ready he took them away, and I didn’t think any more about it. Why should I? Dobie often came in like that to draw large sums.\n\n“Three days later I received a letter from an address in Sussex — a country hotel — written by Dobie and asking me to credit the local branch with ten thousand pounds in his name. Well, as his account now stood at only just over three thousand, I had a bit of a shock, and immediately telephoned the hotel.\n\n“When I explained, he said I’d been tricked, that he hadn’t called personally at all on the seventh, that, as a matter of fact, he’d been staying at the hotel ever since the sixth. Naturally, I asked him to come up to London at once. I told the head office, and they called the Yard in.\n\n“And all that the Yard have been able to do so far, Mr. Hawke, is to prove that Bernard Dobie was down in Sussex all that day he was supposed to be cashing the cheque to self in my office! And I’m to be the scapegoat because the head office think I was slack.”\n\nMr. Humphrey jumped out of the chair excitedly.\n\n“But I wasn’t slack, Mr. Hawke! I swear I wasn’t! That man looked like Dobie, talked like him — he was even dressed in a suit I’ve seen the real Dobie often wearing. And he signed the cheque in front of me! “\n\n“Was it a perfect signature?” asked Hawke.\n\nThe bank manager frowned and seated himself again. “Well — since — under the microscope, experts have spotted one or two little discrepancies. That’s where I’m criticised. But when you see a man you know well sign a cheque in front of you, when you can recognise every inch of him just like you’d know your own son — “\n\nDixon Hawke nodded sympathetically.\n\n“Besides,” Humphrey went on, “I’d have expected his signature to be a little wobbly. He’d got two damaged fingers on his right hand — he told me he’d caught them in a door. The nails were black; I saw them. Very black. That’s one of the reasons the man couldn’t really have been Dobie, because there’s nothing wrong with Dobie’s right hand, and never has been. And these bruised nails would have taken weeks to heal.”\n\n“What about the cheque-book?” asked Hawke. “Surely you could have checked if it had been issued to Dobie?”\n\n“The impostor didn’t use a book. He said he’d run out of cheques, and we issued him a new one. Why not? There was no reason to be suspicious.”\n\n“And he used the first cheque from the new book?”\n\n“Yes. And the rest of the book was found two days ago in a flower-bed in St James’s Park. As we have our address on the cheques, it was sent to us by the park-keeper who found it.”\n\n“It certainly seems you’ve been very neatly tricked, Mr. Humphrey,” said the Dover Street criminologist. “But just how do you think I can help you?”\n\n“By finding out the truth! I’m convinced that if the truth is known, there isn’t a man in the banking profession who could blame me for what has happened! Whereas now — “\n\n“But if the Yard — “\n\n“They’re beaten, Mr. Hawke. So is the bank’s detective. They can’t find any trace of the impostor. He’s clever enough to outwit them, yet I’m blamed for being taken in by him. I say he must have been Dobie’s double.”\n\n“Who’s in charge for the Yard?”\n\n“An Inspector Harris.”\n\nDixon Hawke’s eyes twinkled. He and Harris had crossed swords before.\n\n“Very well, Mr. Humphrey, I’ll see if I can help you,” said Hawke.\n\n“Thank you! “ exclaimed the bank manager. “It — it isn’t the loss of salary I’m worried over. It’s the shame, the disgrace — to be pushed down after — after — “\n\n“I know,” said Hawke gently. “I’d feel the same way about it. By the way, this impostor fellow didn’t make up any sort of story as to why nine thousand pounds was wanted!”\n\n“No; oh, no.”\n\n“Wasn’t that suspicious?”\n\nHumphrey shook his head.\n\n“Dobie always kept things to himself. If he told me anything, it wasn’t till afterwards.”\n\n“I see. Pretty secretive about his coups?”\n\nYes,” said Humphrey miserably.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nLess than an hour later Hawke had secured a reluctant interview with Inspector Harris.\n\n“Had the sauce to hire his own detective, eh?” snorted that official. “That won’t make the bank like him any better. A bit of impertinence, that’s what they’ll think about it. Same as I do. Everything’s being done that can be. If Humphrey hadn’t been such an incompetent fool in the first place — “\n\n“You’re making headway, then?”\n\n“Well, the imposter was obviously either Slim Vincent or Bugs Carter; they’re the only two clever and cool enough to tackle this sort of job. We thought Vincent was still in the States, but perhaps he’s slipped back again. We’ll soon get the scent of both of them, anyway.”\n\n“You’re certain this Dobie fellow —”\n\nHarris waved a sheet of paper under Hawke’s nose.\n\n“Take a look at that, if you want to waste time! Eight witnesses! Except for intervals of less than half an hour, Dobie was seen in the hotel or grounds right through the day.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Talkative Porter\n\nHawke studied the neatly-compiled time-table that Inspector Harris handed him. It showed that Dobie had watched tennis on the hotel court, had slept in a deck-chair in the garden, had strolled in the hotel grounds, had read in the lounge, had had breakfast and lunch and dinner — and had been witnessed doing these things by no less than eight reliable pairs of eyes!\n\n“Think you can break that up by suggesting the witnesses were all in collaboration, eh?” inquired Harris nastily.\n\nHawke did not appear to have heard the gibe.\n\n“Is Dobie still at the Tenfield Manor Hotel?” he asked.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And does he stay in like this every day?”\n\n“No. Apparently he thought he’d got a cold coming on. He’s been going about since.”\n\n“Humphrey told me that Dobie had arrived at the hotel the day before the fraud.”\n\n“Yes. In the evening. Signed the book — no doubt about the signature. A darned sight better than the one on the cheque which your fool of a client passed! “\n\n“Did he stay in all that night as well?”\n\nInspector Harris sniffed. “How should I know? We’re not worried about what happened on the sixth, are we? It’s the seventh we’re working on — the day it happened! “\n\nThe Dover Street man smiled.\n\n“I think I’ll take a trip down to Tenfield. You never know, do you?”\n\nTwo hours later Hawke arrived at the Tenfield Manor Hotel. He had left Tommy Burke a few moments before in the High Street of the old Sussex market town.\n\n“Just in case,” he had said, “that it turns out better for us to seem unconnected.”\n\nBernard Dobie was out, and Hawke contented himself with checking up the accounts of the various witnesses as to Dobie’s whereabouts on the day of the fraud.\n\nAs he had expected, however, there was no loophole to be discovered. Harris’s work was invariably sound and methodically accurate.\n\nThe porter was the most talkative and observant of those he questioned.\n\n“Now, tell me,” said Hawke, “what did Mr. Dobie do when he arrived? The first night, I mean.”\n\n“Had dinner.”\n\n“And after that?”\n\n“He went for a stroll, sir.”\n\n“And for how long?”\n\n“Well, the nights are drawing in now — he was back as soon as it was really dark. Couldn’t have been gone for more than an hour, sir.”\n\n“I see. What time was dinner over?”\n\n“Seventy-thirty or so.”\n\nHawke nodded. “So he was strolling from, say, seven-thirty to eight-thirty?”\n\nThe porter nodded.\n\n“That’s about it, sir, I reck’n.”\n\n“He didn’t go out the next night, I suppose?”\n\n“No — not at all that day, I don’t think. ‘Ad a bit of a cold, he did.”\n\n“Do you know when he left the hotel the next time?”\n\n“Yes, sir. Next morning before breakfast. Got up early, he did. I know that because I met him in the hall, and I asked him if ‘is cold was better. He said it was and he was going out to get up an appetite.”\n\n“What time was that?”\n\n“Well, I was doing the porch over, so it must ‘ave been about eight.”\n\n“And he was back at nine for breakfast?”\n\n“Yes. Pretty close on, anyway.”\n\n“H’m. An hour again,” murmured Hawke. “Well, thanks very much,” he said in a louder voice, pulling some silver from his pocket. Five shillings exchanged ownership. “Now, just keep quiet about this little chat, and I may want you to repeat it.”\n\nHe was in the act of turning away when another point seemed to cross his mind, and he wheeled round on the porter with the question :\n\n“By the way, what does Mr. Dobie do with himself down here, do you know?”\n\n“Fishing mostly. Down on the Bedder, sir. Anyone who stays here can use the fishing — special arrangement it is.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n“Dr. Miller’s” Mistake\n\nHawke drove back to the town well satisfied with these preliminary inquiries. He found Tommy Burke in the newspaper room of the Public Library, as they had arranged.\n\n“Youngster,” he said, “I want you to do some research. I believe a car has pulled up recently at some lonely spot on the London road about half a mile or three-quarters from the Manorly Hotel.\n\nAt any rate, about as far as a man could walk in fifteen or twenty minutes. There may still be traces.”\n\nTommy grinned. “If there are, I’ll find ‘em, guv’nor.”\n\n“Unfortunately, if it did happen, it’s eight days ago,” Hawke went on. “Other cars may have pulled up since. But wherever you find any signs of them, search the whole vicinity — collect anything and everything that might mean a clue. The weather’s been dry — that at least is in our favour.”\n\nAfter a few further words telling Tommy his future plans, Hawke proceeded to the station and went back to London and Dover Street.\n\nWhen at nine that night a car pulled up outside the Manor Hotel, and a boarded, scholastic-looking gentleman inquired if he could stay for a few days, not even the talkative porter recognised Hawke’s voice or face.\n\nTo the reception-clerk he gave his name as : “Dr. Miller. Philosophy, not medicine! I always say that — in case someone’s taken ill and time is lost looking for me. I’m told the fishing’s very good here.”\n\nIn less than half an hour the inhabitants of Tenfield Manor Hotel were only too well aware that an excessively talkative addition had been made to their community.\n\nHawke soon spotted Bernard Dobie. He was reading a paper in the lounge and looking restlessly bored. The disguised criminologist pounced on him.\n\n“Excuse me, sir, but haven’t I seen you before?”\n\nDobie looked up irritably, but before he could say a word Hawke answered his own question.\n\n“No, I can see now — it’s someone frightfully like you. Almost your double, but not quite. Very peculiar. And I’ve seen him several times in the last few days, too. In London, of course — in London. Not here.”\n\nDobie’s face paled slightly. “Er — that’s interesting,” he said slowly. “Where — where abouts?”\n\n“Oh, in the West End, you know. I’ve been having a little holiday myself there, you see. But I’m glad you aren’t the fellow I saw — for your sake.” Hawke laughed feebly. “He’s rather gay, I fear.”\n\n“Gay — gay? — What do you mean? Drink?”\n\nHawke nodded sadly. “I fear so. That’s why I’ve noticed him. Twice I saw him in Piccadilly, and — “ Hawke sighed and shook his head.\n\n“Look here, was he really like me?”\n\nHawke raised his eyebrows at the sharpness of Bernard Dobie’s tone. “Why, do you actually know someone who might be your double? How odd! People so rarely meet their own doubles.”\n\n“Well, I don’t, anyway,” snapped Dobie. “Only if he’s like me, as you say, people might make mistakes. I happen to be quite well known in the West End myself.”\n\n“How very awkward! I — I wish I’d said nothing. I’ve disturbed your peace of mind. Thoughtless of me. But perhaps he isn’t so much like you after all — “\n\nDobie got up abruptly. “Excuse me,” he said. “I have to go out.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n“Number, Please!”\n\nA minute or so later Hawke saw him come downstairs in a light coat, and go out of the hotel.\n\nAt a discreet distance Hawke followed, exercising all his long experience in the art of seeing without being seen. As he had expected, Dobie stopped as soon as he came to the nearest public telephone box, and went inside.\n\nThe call lasted ten minutes.\n\nDobie emerged from the box, and turned back to the hotel. Hawke hid himself in the bushes at the side of the road, and waited for Dobie to pass. Then he hurried on to the call-box.\n\n“Operator,” he said, “you’ve just got a number for the last user of this line. Probably a London number. I want you to jot it down before you forget it.”\n\n“But — “\n\n“I’m not asking you to break your regulations and give it to me. But I’ll call at your exchange to-night with the proper authority to demand it. So just make a note of it! My name’s Hawke — Dixon Hawke — and I’m on a case Scotland Yard are interested in.”\n\n“Well, all right,” said the operator doubtfully.\n\nHawke immediately hurried into Tenfield. There he made for the police station and introduced himself.\n\n“You don’t look like the pictures I’ve seen of Mr. Hawke,” said the sergeant in charge.\n\n“I’m glad to hear it. I’m doing my best not to,” Hawke chuckled. “Put a call through, to the Yard and try to get Inspector Harris. He’ll tell you I’m supposed to be in Tenfield, if you’re doubtful.”\n\nIt took time. Harris was only reached at his home. But eventually the message came through.\n\n“Well, I suppose it’s all right, sir,” said the sergeant. “What do you want us to do?”\n\n“I want you to come with me to the local telephone exchange,” Hawke explained. “They put through a call for someone to-night and I want to know the number! “\n\nThe sergeant’s authority was sufficient to impress the operator. The number Dobie had rung was Trafalgar 2376, and Hawke’s mouth set itself in a line of grim satisfaction as he noted down the information.\n\nWhen Hawke got back to the hotel he found that his room had been searched in his absence. There was no untidiness, but things had been slightly moved from their proper places.\n\nHe smiled. He was too experienced to let down his disguises with undisguised luggage. There was nothing in his room that might not have belonged to the tedious Dr. Miller.\n\nDobie was rattled, was he?\n\nThe next morning Hawke ran the car into Tenfield, and contacted with Tommy.\n\nHe saw at once from Tommy’s face that his assistant had something to report.\n\n“I found one place,” said the young assistant. “Just off the road on the common. The grass had been crushed down by a car, and there were stains as if oil had dropped. And I found this near it.”\n\n“This” was a small piece of cotton wool. About half of its outside surface was hard and matted where a pinkish deposit had dried and bound the fibers together.\n\n“I could never have hoped for so much proof,” said Hawke.\n\n“I found the spot last night, and I spent more than an hour up there before breakfast to-day,” said Tommy. “But that was all I could find — “\n\n“Ah! “ smiled the famous criminologist. “Enough to transform pure guesswork into hard fact! “ He got into the car again. “I’m going up to the Yard. Meanwhile, I want you to keep your eyes glued on a man here.”\n\nHawke described Bernard Dobie. “I don’t think he’ll risk leaving Tenfield — but he might,” he concluded as he climbed into his car.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nDobie’s Double\n\nIn little over seventy minutes Hawke’s car was running over Westminster Bridge. Removing his facial disguise in the nearest cloakroom, he went straight to New Scotland Yard. Harris was in his office.\n\nThe Dover Street man smiled at the pile of papers on the inspector’s desk.\n\n“Back soon,” Harris grunted.\n\n“Yes. It’s got a bit too big to handle from Sussex.”\n\nHarris jerked his head up. “Eh?”\n\n“The impostor you want is keeping himself quiet at the address corresponding to the telephone number, Trafalgar 2376. I want you to dig out that address from the G.P.O., and then we’ll go there together.”\n\n“Yon mean he’s the man who cashed the cheque — “\n\n“No! “\n\nHarris snorted. “Then what the dickens do you mean?”\n\nThe famous criminologist explained developments to the amazed Harris as the two left the office.\n\nHalf an hour later the two detectives arrived at 33 Gwynn Street — the boarding-house in the Covent Garden area that corresponded to the Trafalgar telephone number.\n\nThe landlady was quickly impressed by Inspector Harris’s official manner. Yes, one of her lodgers was in — the others all had work and were out, but this one didn’t.\n\nNervously she led them upstairs to the top landing.\n\nShe knocked on the door. “Mr. Brown, some gentlemen to see you.”\n\n“Who? No one I want to see! “ a voice answered.\n\n“I think you’d better see us,” said Harris loudly and firmly.\n\n“Who the devil are you?”\n\n“Scotland Yard!”\n\nThere was delay and the sound of movements. Hawke motioned to the landlady to stand well aside.\n\n“Come on — open up, now! “ Harris shouted.\n\nHawke placed himself close against the wall on the lock side of the door.\n\nSuddenly the door swung violently open. A man rushed out and hurled a handful of some powdery substance straight in the face of Inspector Harris. Harris reeled back choking.\n\nDixon Hawke Hung himself on the man’s back. Tears ran down both their eyes during the struggle as grains of pepper spread in the narrow space. But the man was flabby and no match for Hawke’s trained fitness. In a few minutes he was pinned down and winded.\n\n“Very silly to throw pepper,” said the criminologist. “Now we can arrest you — not just ask questions! “\n\nSlowly recovering from the effects of the pepper attack, Inspector Harris handed Hawke the “bracelets.” Hawke snapped them over Brown’s wrists.\n\nThen he studied his prisoner’s face and build.\n\n“Yes, you’re very like Dobie, aren’t you? A little older, a little paler — but make-up would soon change that.”\n\n“I — I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Brown, in a desperate attempt at a final bluff.\n\n“No? Where were you from the night of September the sixth to the morning of the eighth? Here? Or at Tenfield?”\n\n“I — I went away. I — “\n\n“Remember, we shall check up on anything you say. We know the part you played in this affair.”\n\nBrown squirmed. A bitter expression set in on his face.\n\n“He’s ratted, has he?”\n\n“No, not yet,” said Hawke smoothly. “But he will — when he meets you face to face at Tenfield this afternoon! “\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nQuick-Change Artists\n\nAt four o’clock a police car glided through the narrow streets of Tenfield. Dixon Hawke sat in front with the driver; Harris in the back with the now resigned Brown.\n\nAs they drove across the ancient bridge that spanned the Bedder, Hawke caught sight of Tommy Burke leaning over the parapet.\n\n“Stop!” he said sharply. “Our man must be here.”\n\nThe car slowed down and Hawke leapt out.\n\n“Well, youngster?”\n\nTommy jerked his head towards the river below. “There he is.”\n\nThe detective saw Dobie sitting on a small canvas chair and holding a rod listlessly over the water.\n\nHe turned round and beckoned to the occupants of the car.\n\nThen, with Brown firmly pinioned between them, Hawke and Inspector Harris went down the steps by the side of the bridge on to the towpath.\n\n“Good-afternoon, Mr. Dobie,” said Hawke as they drew near the angler.\n\nDobie looked up and gave a gasp of astonishment.\n\n“Who — who are you?” he spluttered.\n\nThe man from Dover Street enlightened him as he slipped a pair of handcuffs on his wrists. Dobie was too overcome by surprise to offer either resistance or protest.\n\nAt a quiet tea party in the grounds of the Manor Hotel after Dobie and Brown had been safely housed at Tenfield Police Station, Hawke explained.\n\n“I never felt that the impersonation took place at the bank. How much more likely that the real Dobie did call at the bank while the impostor took his place at the hotel. The hotel was far easier to bluff — nobody there really knew Dobie.\n\n“The more facts I learned, the more probable this theory became. At the bank Dobie’s signature wasn’t quite a perfect specimen. Also, he had his finger-nails coloured to look bruised. Why? To make his visit seem like an impersonation afterwards.\n\n“Yet it was a perfect signature in the hotel register. Which showed that the real Dobie had arrived there. But he left for an hour’s stroll immediately after dinner that night, and he did the same before breakfast the morning after the fraud. At once I guessed that these strolls were the occasions for the changeover at the hotel.\n\n“At some pre-arranged and lonely spot Dobie and Brown exchanged clothes that first night. And Brown came back to the hotel. All the next day he stayed in with an assumed bad cold. Remember, there is plenty of evidence that he was seen — but the same evidence establishes that he did practically no talking. The following morning out goes Brown, the process is repeated — and back comes the real Bernard Dobie again.\n\nHawke paused and smiled.\n\n“I guessed that the impostor was lying low somewhere in the West End. Dobie moved about in the West End — it seemed probable that the plot had been hatched there. I took a big chance and startled Dobie by making him think his accomplice had been doing some dangerously public celebrating. It came off and Dobie was terrified.\n\n“The urgent telephone call followed and the rest you know.”\n\nHawke fumbled for a moment in his pocket.\n\n“Oh — and there’s this clue,” he added. “Maybe you’d like it, Inspector. Brown being paler than Dobie, a little make-up was needed. This is a piece of the cotton-wool it was wiped off with — carelessly dropped on the morning Dobie came back. Tommy found the spot where the exchange of identity took place.\n\n“I guessed it must be about fifteen or twenty minutes’ walk from the hotel. Nearer would have been risky; farther would hardly have allowed enough time for the dressing and undressing. A car must have been used, so that Dobie wasn’t seen on his journeys — as he would have been had he gone by train.”\n\nHarris gave one of his customary grunts.\n\n“But where’s the money — the nine thousand?” he demanded.\n\nDixon Hawke smiled.\n\n“Why worry where they’ve hidden it? It’s Dobie’s own money, anyway! My client, Mr. Humphrey, was perfectly correct — it was Dobie who visited him that day, and Dobie had every right to draw nine thousand pounds.\n\n“Dobie intended to draw the whole of his account, and so make the bank lose the nine thousand an ‘ impostor ‘ had drawn in his name.” Hawke got up. “Now I’m going to telephone Mr. Humphrey and tell him he’s absolutely cleared, and then my job’s done.”\n\n“Well, it beats me,” said Inspector Harris. “I could have sworn it was one of Vincent’s or Carter’s jobs.”\n\n“You looked for the impostor at the wrong end,” grinned Hawke.\n\nA few weeks later Dobie and Brown, who proved to be a cousin of Dobie’s, were sentenced to two years imprisonment each for attempt to defraud the Home Counties Bank.\n\n~THE END~\n"

His body, horribly mangled and disfigured beyond recognition, was shipped home, where it was buried with all the honors due a man of his position.\n\nIn view of the fact that his was the only body not positively identified, together with the further fact that he was a personal friend of the conductor, one James Barley, who testified at the inquest that he had talked with Conners not over five minutes before the wreck, his family and friends accepted the remains without question.\n\nI alone know the true story of John Conners.\n\nI am making this statement in the hope that a great wrong may be righted.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nLatham&#39;s Arrest\n\nCaptain John Conners had been in the West in search of a gang of forgers who had made New York their headquarters. Failing to locate his men, he was on his way home when a telegram intercepted him at Denver asking him to keep an eye open for one Simon Latham, wanted in New York for murder.\n\nLatham, known throughout the country as a gunman and gangster, had, according to the telegram, committed a crime of unusual atrocity, killing two policemen in cold blood and making his escape unscathed. He was believed to have gone to Denver, where he was known to have friends. Conners, being well acquainted with him, was asked to stop over in the Colorado city to assist the police in their search.\n\nTwo days spent in Denver convinced him that there was nothing to be gained by a longer stay.\n\nThe second day out of the Western metropolis he was passing through the train on his way to the observation car when he suddenly located his quarry slumped down in a seat in the smoking compartment. In spite of the fact that Latham had disguised himself to the best of his ability by growing a stubby beard and donning smoked glasses, Conners had no trouble in recognizing him.\n\nLatham was alone in the compartment at the time. Before he had time to make a move Conners had him covered.\n\n&quot;Up with your hands, Latham!&quot; he commanded.\n\nThe gunman obeyed the order.\n\n&quot;Who d&#39;ye think I am, damn yeh?&quot; he snarled.\n\nConners smiled. &quot;I don&#39;t think — I know!&#39;&#39; he answered. &quot;You are — &quot;\n\nHe was interrupted by a crash. His revolver flew from his hand as he pitched forward into the arms of the man he had arrested. An instant later both men were hurried across the car and buried under a mass of debris.\n\nThen hell broke loose. The wrecked train was enveloped in flames. Clouds of scalding steam drove the rescuers back time after time. The air was filled with the shrieks of the wounded and the groans of the dying. Men worked like demons to save those who were buried beneath the burning wreckage.\n\nConners and Latham, hidden under the debris of two cars, were among the last to be found. The body of the policeman was little more than a charred mass of flesh. Under him, yet protected to a certain extent by his form, was Simon Latham. He, too, had suffered terrible injuries, yet within his shell still lingered the breath of life.\n\nAs they dragged the form of the murderer from beneath the wreckage even the hardened physicians and volunteer nurses gasped with astonishment that he still lived. His face had been parboiled by the scalding steam until the flesh hung in strips. His body, from which the clothes had been burned, was a solid mass of burns.\n\nSwathed in cotton, saturated with oil, they rushed him to the hospital. A week passed. He remained unidentified.\n\nAfter a month he took a slight turn for the better. Finally he was able to speak a few words. Physicians and nurses gathered around his bed and asked him to identify himself.\n\nHe answered them listlessly, seemingly as a child repeats a lesson.\n\nHe was Simon Latham, gunman, gangster — murderer! He was wanted in New York, he told them, for the killing of two policemen. Captain Conners had been about to arrest him when the wreck intervened.\n\nThey expected him to die. It was an impossibility, said the physicians, for a man in his condition to continue living. They believed that he realized it and was making a death-bed confession. They summoned a priest. To the Holy Father he repeated the same story.\n\nAnd then he got well — as well as a man can get who has passed through hell.\n\nThe New York police were notified. When he left the hospital it was with handcuffs on his wrists. Yet he made no resistance. His spirit was broken. He reiterated his confession, denying nothing, admitting everything. The State furnished him with an attorney. Acting on the lawyer&#39;s advice he threw himself on the mercy of the court. A kind-hearted judge, taking his physical condition into consideration, sentenced him to life imprisonment rather than the chair.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Model Prisoner\n\nSimon Latham became a model prisoner. He went about his appointed tasks in a solemn, mechanical sort of way, a broken-down old man scarcely out of his teens — a man whose face was seamed with myriad scars, twisted and contorted out of shape by muscular contraction. His short-cropped hair was snow-white, his form bent and feeble. In his eyes was a far-away look — the look of a dog that has lost its master.\n\nEventually he was made a trusty. He performed his work with a servility that surprised those who had known him in former years.\n\nEveryone remembers the prison break of some weeks ago. Five hundred men  — the dregs of civilization — armed with a miscellaneous collection of weapons garnered from God knows where, threw themselves against the little group of guards in the big dining-hall. For two hours the battle waged to and fro. Eventually the officials, better armed, better disciplined, won out. Yet the victory was not gained without considerable loss.\n\nAs is always the case, many of the prisoners aligned themselves on the side of law and order. Among them was Simon Latham, the lifer.\n\nWhen the trouble broke loose Latham was standing midway between the row of prisoners and the little knot of guards. As the missiles flew through the air he was caught between two fires. Something — a dish or bowl — struck him squarely on the head. He dropped to the floor unconscious.\n\nFor five minutes the battle waged across his body. Then he recovered consciousness and plunged into the fray with almost maniacal strength, aiding the guards wherever possible. When the affair was ended and the mutineers were finally herded back into their cells, he was bleeding from a dozen wounds.\n\nHere is the peculiar feature: Immediately after the fight Latham, the model prisoner, became a prison outlaw. He refused to obey prison discipline, insisted on hobnobbing with the guards, and attempted to escape whenever occasion offered itself.\n\nHe was taken before the warden. The latter, who had taken a great interest in the case of the former gunman, especially since his services at the time of the break, tried argument.\n\nLatham insisted to the warden that he was being unjustly held. He asserted that he was not Simon Latham, the outlaw, but Captain John Conners, the policeman!\n\nThe warden, a man not prone to forget favors, finally ordered him taken from the cell where he had been confined after his outbreak and placed in the insane ward under observation. He is there now.\n\nHere are the facts as I deduce them. I am positive that I am right:\n\nCaptain Conners was in the act of arresting Latham when the wreck occurred. He had, as I have said, drawn his revolver and with it covered the murderer.\n\n&quot;Who d&#39;ye think I am, damn yeh?&quot; the gangster demanded.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t think — I know!&quot; Conners answered. &quot;You are — &quot;\n\nBefore he could finish his sentence the cars were piled together. He was thrown forward and received a terrific blow on the head. Then and there all memory disappeared.\n\nBut in his subconscious mind were the thoughts that had been flashing through his brain while he was making the arrest!\n\nHis subconscious memory retained nothing but the impressions of Simon Latham. He had known Latham for years. His history was, to the policeman, an open book.\n\nHe was about to utter Latham&#39;s name when the blow came that erased all memory. So while the conscious mind of Captain John Conners was obliterated, there remained in the tiny cells in the back of his head the recollection of the man who stood before him at that last instant.\n\nLatham was killed. His body, mutilated beyond all recognition, was buried as Captain John Conners. Conners, disfigured and mutilated, speaking only the thoughts that, as I have said, were in his mind at that last instant —  thoughts that had only to do with Simon Latham — accepted the role of Simon Latham, lived it, accepted the punishment of Simon Latham!\n\nYet somewhere in those tiny cells of subconsciousness remained the policeman. He could not be the renegade that Latham had been, because it was not in his make-up, even though in his own mind he was Latham. Why? Because his training had all been on the side of law and order.\n\nThen came the prison break. That flying dish, striking him on the head, removed, in some way, the pressure against his brain. Immediately the role of Simon Latham was forgotten and he started in again where he had left off six years before. He was again Captain Conners, policeman and guardian of the law. As Captain John Conners he plunged into the fight against the convicts.\n\nI am positive, gentlemen, that I am right. I asked that you allow me to return home to my family and friends.\n\nFor, Your Excellency and Gentlemen of the Board of Pardons, I am Captain John Conners!\n\nI trust that you will accept my word. I have no other proof.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Stabbed! Safe opened and rifled — everything taken!”\n\n“Who killed him?” I snapped.\n\n“I — I don’t know.” He buried his face in his hands and sobbed softly for an instant. “I went there to rob him. I found somebody had beat me to it and had — killed — him! Oh, God! It’s horrible!” he ended, sobbing again.\n\n“Let’s get the straight of this,” I commanded gruffly. Police chiefs are not usually the sweetest tempered men in the world, and I am no exception to the rule — especially when I have been without sleep for forty-eight hours, as in the present instance. “You say that old Jones is dead — murdered — his safe robbed? I’ve had no report of it. Now who the devil are you and how does it come that you know so much about the affair?”\n\nMy visitor stopped his snivelling abruptly.\n\n“I’m Tompkins,” he answered shortly, as if the mention of his name settled the whole affair.\n\n“That fails to enlighten me,” I growled. “Elucidate.”\n\n“I am — or was until this afternoon — Jones’ clerk. We had a racket — a quarrel — and he fired me. Let me go without a second’s notice. And he owed me four hundred dollars commission for dirty work that I’ve done for him. Refused to give me a cent of it. Told me to go to the devil when I threatened to tell the police of some of his crooked deals. Said that I was as deep in the mire as he was in the mud and that his word, because he was rich, would go farther than mine anyway. That’s why I — that’s the reason I went there to rob the safe tonight — just to get what was coming to me. I swear I didn’t intend to take a cent more than he owed me.”\n\nI nodded uncomprehendingly.\n\n“All right. Now go ahead with your story,” I said, a trifle more gently than before.\n\nTompkins dabbed at his eyes with his handkerchief.\n\n“I went to the office tonight just about midnight,” he explained, “intending to let myself in with my passkey. When we had our racket today the old man forgot to ask me for it and I was too sore to give it to him — me who’s done his dirty work for five years past and then getting fired that way.\n\n“I knew that he hadn’t had the combination on the safe changed, and he and I were the only ones who knew it. I knew that if I got the four hundred he owed me he’d never dare squeal. And even if he did I’d be far enough way by morning to be out of danger. You know where his office is? — fifth floor of the Torrence Building. I climbed the stairs rather than take the elevator, figuring on not taking any chances.\n\n“I didn’t meet a soul on the way going up. The office was dark. I let myself in with my passkey, stood inside the door listening for an instant, then pulled down the shade so that there would no light show through the ground-glass panel of the door. Then I tiptoed my way to the two windows and pulled down their shades and then punched the electric-light button. I don’t know why I tiptoed. No one knew that I had been fired, and anyone in the building would have presumed, had they noticed me, that I was there working overtime, as I often have in the past. I suppose that it was the natural caution a man feels when he knows that he is somewhere he hadn’t ought to be.”\n\nHe hesitated a second. Then: “I suppose that you’ll think I’m a darned liar when I tell you what happened,” he finally resumed.\n\n“Go ahead!” I said shortly.\n\n“When the lights flashed on I naturally took a survey of the room. The safe was standing open with a lot of papers that had been in it strewn about the floor.\n\n“I knew then that somebody had been there ahead of me — might be there then. You can bet that I lost no time in making for the door.\n\n“I was scared — scared all over. I had that creepy feeling that a fellow gets at such times. And just as I got my hand on the knob I heard a noise from the private office — the office the old man uses — used, I mean — in which to receive his clients.\n\n“It sounded like a moan — a sort of dull, throaty groan!\n\n“Every hair on my scalp rose straight up. I turned my head involuntarily in the direction from whence the sound came.\n\n“Through the door I saw the old man sitting behind his desk, his head hanging over the hack of his chair! The handle of a knife was sticking out of his chest, and his whole breast was covered with blood!\n\n“Right then and there I opened the door and fled. You couldn’t have held me in that room with a million dollars.”\n\n“Did you see anyone in the corridor as you passed out?” I asked.\n\nTompkins looked sheepish.\n\n“That’s one of the reasons I hurried right here, Chief,” he answered. “One of the fellows who cleans the rooms — janitors I guess you’d call ‘em — was puttering around in the hallway a dozen doors down. I’m pretty certain that he saw me. They all knew me by sight, probably, and I knew that as soon as the murder was discovered he’d remember seeing me come out and report me.\n\n“My first idea was to beat it out of town. But I’m short on money and I knew that you’d get me sooner or later anyway. So I decided to get to you first, make a clean breast of what actually happened and turn myself over to you for attempted burglary before you got me for murder.”\n\n“How long ago did this happen?” I demanded.\n\nTompkins shuddered.\n\n“Not over ten minutes,” he answered. “You know the Torrence Building’s only six blocks away and I hurried here as fast as my legs would carry me.”\n\nI jabbed the button which brought Moore of the Detective Bureau to my side.\n\n“Get a couple of your best men and come with me!” I told him. “Somebody’s snuffed old Levi Jones’s light out.”\n\nMoore gave a quick glance at Tompkins.\n\n“The old devil’s been flirting with trouble for the past ten or fifteen years!” he remarked dryly, as he turned to obey my order. “Meet you in the hallway, Chief, with Dugan and Miles, in about two minutes.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nFood For Thought\n\nThings in Jones’s office were as Tompkins — who was shaking as if with the ague when we entered the room — had described them. In the outer office the lights were still burning as he had said he had left them. They disclosed to view a safe rather larger than the ordinary, the door of which was standing wide open. Drawers had been pulled out and their contents scattered about the floor.\n\nGiving Dugan, who was a finger-print expert of more than ordinary ability, his instructions, the remainder of us entered the smaller office.\n\nJones was seated in a high-back, broad-armed, leather-upholstered chair, his right side turned toward the door. His body was slumped backward, his head hanging over the back of the chair in an indescribable — almost grotesque — position. His eyes were wide open, staring glassily at us. Never a handsome man, with his long hooked nose and thin, cadaverous face surmounted by its thatch of unkempt hair, in death he was positively repulsive.\n\nFrom his left breast protruded the handle of a knife. It had evidently been driven from behind over his shoulder and with tremendous force straight to the heart. That death had been instantaneous there was not a doubt. A thin stream of blood had flown from the wound, staining the shirtfront a dull brownish crimson.\n\nI took one of the old man’s claw-like hands in my own. The body was already beginning to grow cold. I deduced — and Moore and Miles agreed with me — that he had been dead at least an hour.\n\nI turned to Tompkins, who had dropped into the nearest chair and was again sniveling to himself.\n\n“Have you ever seen that knife before?” I asked, pointing to the weapon in the dead man’s breast.\n\nTompkins nodded.\n\n“God! Yes!” he answered. “It was his. Somebody gave it to him once — always kept it on his desk for a paper weight and letter opener.”\n\nI called Dugan from the other room.\n\n“Look that knife-handle over for prints!” I told him.\n\nThe little detective busied himself with his magnifying glass for a brief time. Then he turned to me with a shrug of his thin shoulders.\n\n“Th’ fellow that did this job didn’t even go to the trouble of wearin’ rubber gloves, Chief. He did the same with this handle that he did with the safe — wiped everything off with a cloth. Maybe used alcohol. There isn’t even a chicken track on either one of them!”\n\nI turned to Moore.\n\n“Find the caretaker and have him bring up the janitor who takes care of this floor,” I instructed.\n\nThen I commanded Tompkins to make a hurried inventory of the contents of the safe. He skimmed over the various papers inside of the pigeonholes and on the floor, completing his task inside of five minutes.\n\n“There was over five thousand dollars in there when I quit this afternoon,” he announced. “In addition several securities that I have noticed in one of the drawers — valued probably at ten or fifteen thousand — are gone. I know that they were there when I left the office, because the old man had been checking them over, and I saw him put ‘em back. It was past banking hours, then, so that the thief must have taken them.”\n\nI looked at Dugan.\n\n“How was the box cracked?” I asked.\n\nThe little detective grinned.\n\n“‘Twasn’t cracked. Chief,” he answered. “The fellow that got inside that box worked the combination. The only fellow that I know who’s clever enough for such a job is Eddie New.”\n\nThe sniveling Tompkins let out a lusty squawk.\n\n“I tell you it can’t be!” he wailed. “Nobody knew the combination except old Jones and myself!”\n\nI turned to the telephone on the desk and called up Headquarters.\n\n“Lenny,” I instructed the sergeant who answered, “look up the records and tell me where Eddie New is right now.”\n\nIn less than a minute the answer came back over the wire: “Chief, Eddie’s laid up with a broken leg — result of an automobile smashup — in Greely’s hangout. Got hurt the week after he got out of stir.”\n\nI hung up the receiver with a bang.\n\nObviously the murderer and thief was not Eddie New, the only crook in the city really competent of opening a strictly modern safe such as that before us without damaging the mechanism. Nor was Eddie New the sort of man to commit a murder; he was of the more modern, “Jimmie Valentine” sort — clever with his fingers, clever with his head, planning his work as carefully as a business man plans his deals, guarding every contingency before taking a step.\n\nThere was a bare possibility that Jones had opened the safe himself while entertaining some visitor, and that later the visitor had taken his life and made away with the money and securities. But granting that such was the case, why had the murderer gone to the trouble of carefully wiping the finger prints off from the safe? For in such a case the only prints would be those of the dead man himself. Verily the affair was assuming some angles that gave food for thought.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Package of Bills\n\nMoore entered with Grady, the head janitor, and a pale, dull-appearing man whom he introduced as Billy Murphy, who, according to Grady, did the cleaning on the fifth floor. Tompkins identified him at once as the man he had seen cleaning the corridor at the time he made his escape from the office after discovering the murder.\n\nMurphy, readily admitting that he had noticed Tompkins leave the office hurriedly about midnight, came forward with a story which complicated matters worse than ever:\n\nHe had been working some distance down the hallway between ten and eleven o’clock. At that time, chancing to pass Jones’s office, he had seen a light shining through the ground-glass door. About half an hour later, again passing the door, he had heard the sound of voices — one low and indistinct, the other plainly recognizable as that of the money lender himself.\n\nHe imagined that he had heard a cry. Yet he was not certain. At any rate, Jones’s voice had stopped suddenly, but inasmuch as he, Murphy, was moving down the corridor at the time, he had given the matter no more thought.\n\nLater he remembered again passing the office and noticing that the light had been extinguished. That was all that he knew about the affair until he saw Tompkins rush out of the place about midnight.\n\nThe man was plainly nervous and ill at ease, as is usually the case of the more ignorant when brought face to face with the law for the first time. Yet something about his manner caused me to do some hurried thinking. When he had completed his story I ordered him searched.\n\nHidden in his inside coat pocket Moore found a package of bills amounting to nearly one thousand dollars!\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe “Third Degree”\n\nWhence came that money? Hundred-dollar-a-month janitors are not apt to be carrying huge amounts of cash about their clothes. Breaking down under our questioning he said that he had found the money in the hallway close to the door at the time he had passed the office a third time and discovered it dark. He was a poor man, he said, with a wife and family to support. He had at first intended turning the money in to Grady, his superior, but later decided to keep it, hiding it until the hue and cry which was certain to follow its loss had blown over, when he would bank it a small amount at a time.\n\nThere was nothing for me to do but hold William Murphy for the murder of Levi Jones.\n\nHe confessed.\n\nYet after he had admitted to the killing of Levi Jones I felt that he was a liar even though his confession as I had written it and with his rambling signature at the end lay before me. The pieces refused to dovetail together.\n\nAlthough policemen refuse to admit that there is such a thing as the “Third Degree,” seldom is a confession secured without using some method which would not stand the limelight of publicity. The newspaper boys know it and wink at it. It is necessary and, in some form or another, is used the world over. It is part of the price the criminal pays for his war against society. I used the “Third Degree” on William Murphy.\n\nA glance at his peculiar complexion and the nervous twitching of his facial muscles showed that he was a “dope.” The presence of a small quantity of cocaine in his pocket substantiated the fact.\n\nIt was nearly morning when we arrested Murphy. He had been working all night. Naturally, he was tired and sleepy. For the remainder of that day and half of the following night Moore, Dugan, Miles and myself took turns keeping him awake. We questioned him constantly and from a thousand angles. He refused to tell a different story than the one he had given us at first — that of finding the money in the hallway.\n\nOn the table before his weary eyes we laid a big package of “dope.” At frequent intervals we brought into the room other “snowbirds.” We gave them free rein to the “snow.” The joyous light that overspread their features as they sniffed the poison was enough to break a stronger will than that of William Murphy. He finally gave up.\n\nI read to him the confession as I had reconstructed the crime. According to my deductions Jones had gone to his office to work. He had opened the safe and was in his private office when Murphy entered to do the cleaning. In front of Jones was a package of bills he was counting. The paper cutter lay before him. Naturally he thought nothing of seeing Murphy — a man who was in the office daily — busied about his duties.\n\nWorking up to a point close to the money lender, Murphy had suddenly leaped forward, seized the old man by the throat with one hand and with the other plunged the knife into his breast. Even if there had been an outcry, no one would have heard it at that time of night and on that deserted floor. Recalling the stories he had heard of the folly of leaving finger-prints, he had hastily wiped off the knife-handle and the safe dial with his dust cloth — after looting the safe — and hurried back to his work, springing the lock on the door after him.\n\nThis was the crime as I reconstructed it and the confession in substance that Murphy signed.\n\nHe repudiated it next day at the preliminary hearing, upon the advice of his attorney.\n\nAnd I, despite the fact that he had confessed to me, felt that the confession was a falsehood. For there was one weak spot in the whole affair.\n\nTompkins stuck to his assertion that there had been at least five thousand dollars in cash in the safe and securities amounting to between ten and fifteen thousand dollars. There was every reason to believe that as Jones’s clerk he knew what he was talking about. We had found less than a thousand dollars on Murphy when we searched him.\n\nGranted that I was right and that the confession I had forced from the janitor was the truth, what had become of the remainder of the money? Murphy was not clever enough to hide it and keep it hidden in the face of the terrific grilling we had given him. Nor, on the other hand, was he clever enough to act as the tool for someone else, the payment being the money we had found on his person, and keep from disclosing the fact under the “Third Degree.”\n\nThere was something decidedly rotten in Denmark. I was man enough to admit this fact to Moore and his men during the recess after Murphy had taken the stand at preliminary hearing and to admit to them also that if Tompkins confirmed his statement regarding the amount of money when he took the stand that we would have considerable trouble in getting a conviction when the case came to trial. For the court had appointed to defend the janitor a young attorney of more than ordinary ability — a man who might be expected to do his utmost for his client on account of the advertising he would receive in case of an acquittal.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Handle of the Knife\n\nTompkins was the first witness called after recess. He was visibly nervous, yet he retold the story he had told to me almost word for word. The prosecuting attorney was about to turn him over to the attorney for the defense for cross-examination when, like a bolt out of a clear sky, the truth suddenly came to me.\n\nI leaned across the table and whispered to the prosecutor. A startled look flashed across his face, and an instant later he was on his feet moving for an adjournment. His motion was granted. Five minutes later he, Tompkins, Murphy and his attorney, Dugan, Moore, Miles and myself were closeted in the prosecutor’s rooms.\n\nI turned upon Tompkins.\n\n“You cur!” I shouted, shaking my fist under his nose; “you killed Levi Jones yourself, and I, like a fool, almost sent an innocent man to the gallows for your crime!”\n\nHe shrank back, while a gasp of astonishment went up from the others in the room.\n\n“I — I — “ he commenced to stammer. But I stopped him.\n\n“Let me tell you just what happened,” I went on. “You and old Jones were working in the office during the early part of the evening. Murphy says that he saw a light when he passed the door. You lie when you say that Jones fired you during the afternoon. The truth of the matter is that the altercation took place at the time when Murphy says that he heard angry voices as he again passed the door.\n\n“You had probably often quarreled before. Therefore, Jones had no suspicion when you passed behind him. You seized the knife and plunged it into his heart!\n\n“The remainder was easy — for you are a smooth customer — so smooth that you had me hoodwinked all the way through! You rifled the safe, wiped off the finger-prints from it and the knife-handle, and then, watching your chance, tossed the roll of bill out into the hallway where you knew Murphy would find them when he started his cleaning. You knew that he was simple-minded — a dope fiend — knew just what his mental process would be and that he would admit anything under the terrors of the “third degree.” That you guessed right is proved by the result.\n\n“Then you turned out the lights and watched your chance. You probably had the door open a crack. You saw Murphy pick up the roll of money, stuff it into his pocket and, after looking around to see that he was unobserved, busy himself with his pail and mop. Then, when you were certain that he could see you, you rushed from the office and past him to the stairway.\n\n“Your scheme was clever — diabolically so. I’m intensely human — human enough not to suspect a man who openly confesses that he went to a place to commit a burglary and finds that a murder had been committed. I swallowed your story like a veritable boob.\n\n“You realized that, under ordinary circumstances, you would probably be suspected. Therefore, by coming straight to police headquarters, admitting your premeditated guilt and telling of the murder, you threw any suspicions I might otherwise have had to the winds. I went into the investigation firmly convinced that you were innocent. I might have run into evidence against you, but you had it all discounted in advance.\n\n“You made one fatal mistake. I made the other. Mine nearly hanged poor Murphy, here, while yours will hang yourself.”\n\nTompkins gulped. Then: “All right, Chief, you’ve got me foul, I guess. I put the money and securities in an envelope addressed to myself and dropped it down the mail chute. It should have been delivered yesterday afternoon at my home address. There’s just one question I’d like to ask:\n\nI nodded. “Fire away.”\n\n“I’ll admit that I thought I had things fixed up so that you wouldn’t suspect me. And besides I’m a pretty fair actor and I pulled the sob stuff pretty decently you’ll admit. But you say that I made one mistake. Do you mind telling me what it was?”\n\nIt was my turn to smile. “Tompkins,” I said, “your story was too perfect. Remember you told me — and you repeated the same story on the witness stand just now — that you seized the knob of the outer door ready to bolt when you heard a moan. You turned quickly, you claimed, and through the door you saw Jones sitting at his desk, his head hanging over the back of his chair, the handle of a knife sticking out of his chest and his breast covered with blood. That’s where you made you big mistake.”\n\nTompkins looked puzzled.\n\n“I’m still in the dark,” he declared.\n\n“Because,” I answered, “the position of Jones’s desk is such that he was seated with his right side toward the door. He was slumped down in his chair — which is leather upholstered with huge arms, his head hanging over the back and side. It was not until you told your story a second time on the witness stand and I visualized the scene of the crime that the truth suddenly flashed over me.\n\n“From the position of Jones’s desk and the way he was sitting with his right side turned toward the doorway, a man standing at the outer doorway couldn’t see the handle of the knife which was plunged into his heart!”\n\n~ The End ~\n"

Bar whisky for eight cents a shot or a double slug for fifteen. Waterfront Street. The dirty grey waves slapped at the crusted piles and left an oil scum. A street to forget with. A street which could close in on you, day to day, night to night, until you maybe ran into an old friend who slipped you a five, and somebody saw you get it; there at dawn an interne from city hospital would shove your eyelid up with a clean, pink thumb. “Icebox meat,” he’d say. “Morgue bait.” And maybe, as he stood up, he’d look down at your hollow grey face and the sharp bones of your wrists and wonder how you’d kept alive so long. So very long.\n\nBut something happened to Bay Street. It acquired glamor. Reading the trend, the smart boys came down and bought up the property and built long low clubs with blue lights and bright music and expensive drinks. The shining cars lined up along the curb, and the people with the clean clothes gave ragged kids two bits to make certain the tires weren’t slashed while they were inside the places with the bright music and the soft women. The doormen at the new places had no time for the men in broken shoes who were living out the last years of addiction.\n\nSo the men of Bay Street moved to Dorrity Street—one block over. Many of the displaced little bars moved over. The red, blue and green neon flickered against the brick flanks of the ancient warehouses, and, in the night, the steaming chant of the jukeboxes, the hoarse laughter and the scuff of broken shoes was the same as always.\n\nFrank Bard sat on the stone front step of an abandoned warehouse and stared at the street, shining in a light misty rain. The rain made pink halos around the neon of the place across the street. “Allison’s Grill.”\n\nBard thought vaguely that if the rain increased, he’d have to get under shelter. He didn’t want to go inside; he had come out because he had been sick. The muscles of his diaphragm still ached with the violence of his retching. He turned the ragged collar of his dark blue suit coat up around his neck. He wondered if he ought to walk down the alley and see if anybody had tried to move in on him. Two weeks before, he had found a sturdy packing case and, at dawn, had dragged it down the alley and put it under a fire escape. The effort had left him weak and panting. He had filled it with clean burlap and it made a snug bed. The fall rain was chill; the packing case wouldn’t be any good in the winter. He forced that thought out of his mind.\n\nHe was a dark man, with a sullen face. Once he had been solid, almost stocky, but the flesh had slowly melted off him during the past year. He was still capable of sudden, explosive bursts of energy. His hair was long and his square jaw was dark with several day’s beard. His cheeks were hollow and there was a dark wildness in his puffy eyes that the shadows concealed.\n\nAcross the street an old man with matted white hair lurched out of Allison’s and fell on one knee. He got up and went on, limping and cursing in a thin, high voice, watered down by age.\n\nFrank Bard heard the slow tock, tock of heels, heavy heels, coming down the sidewalk on his side. He knew who it was without looking. He scowled down at the sidewalk. The slow steps stopped.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nI Like It This Way\n\nHe looked up. Patrolman Clarence Flynn, tall and solid, stood looking down at him. Flynn’s raincoat had a cape effect across the shoulders that made him look larger than life size.\n\nHe said softly, “You okay, Frankie?”\n\n“Give me a cigarette, Flynn,” Bard said hoarsely.\n\nFlynn handed him one, lit it. Over the match flame the two men glanced briefly into each other’s eyes—and looked quickly away.\n\nIn the same gentle tone, Flynn said, “When are you going to straighten out, Frankie?”\n\n“I like it this way.”\n\n“You were a good cop, Frankie. You straighten out and you could come back in; your record’s good.”\n\n“I like it this way.”\n\n“You look sick, Frankie.”\n\n“I’m fine. You got a beat to walk.”\n\nFlynn shrugged. He handed the half pack of cigarettes to Bard and walked on. He stopped ten feet away and said, “She wasn’t worth this, Frankie; no woman was worth this.”\n\nBard called him a foul word and snapped the half smoked cigarette into the street. After he could no longer hear the sound of Flynn’s heels, he tried to light another one. His hands shook so badly that he couldn’t do it. The matches were damp. They sputtered and went out quickly.\n\nHe felt in his side pocket to make certain that the fifty-cent piece was still there. It was cool against his fingertips. He stood up, swaying slightly, and then walked across the street, pushed his way into the heat and smell of Allison’s.\n\nThe bar was of plywood laid over some heavier substance. Naked bulbs were laid behind the bottles on the back bar, and the light glowed through—amber. The place was narrow and rectangular—with the bar on the left and booths on the right. A jukebox sat against the far wall, bubbles rising endlessly up through the colored tubes. Arther Allison, a small trim man with Truman glasses and a grey Colman mustache, in a spotless white shirt, waited on bar, his quick eyes flicking ceaselessly from face to face. Allison was a watchful, careful man.\n\nJader waited on the booths and, on occasion, acted as bouncer. Jader was tall and heavy with weak eyes that watered constantly. He, too, was watchful.\n\nUnderneath the bar, to the left of the beer taps, was a small drawer. There were usually a few small packages in that drawer. Summer and winter a small hot coal fire burned in the basement. In the winter, the fire heated the building; in the summer the radiators were turned off. On the under edge of the drawer containing the packages was a small loop of wire. Either Jader or Allison could, by yanking on the loop of wire, drop the bottom of the drawer. The little packages would then drop down a chute into the fire. It was safer that way. For every package held and relayed to the proper pickup men, there was a small fee of ten dollars. Five for Jader and five for Allison. On some days as many as eight packages spent varying lengths of time in the drawer.\n\nAllison and Jader were very watchful and cautious men.\n\nWhen Frank Bard walked in, there were four men at the bar. He knew three of them by sight; the fourth was a stranger. Two of the booths were occupied. In one were two Swedish merchant seamen, and a thin painted girl with hair the color of ripe tomatoes and a wet, smeared mouth. In the second booth were two quiet men wearing dark topcoats. Bard glanced at them and guessed that they were waiting for one of the packages to arrive.\n\nBard di\td a curious thing. He held the door wide, and, as he walked over to the bar, he smiled down over his right shoulder. He said something in a low voice.\n\nHe stepped up beside the stranger, still smiling down at a point about six inches from his right shoulder. Allison moved over toward him and said, “You got the money, Frank?”\n\nHe took the fifty-cent piece from his pocket and said, “The usual for me and Jeanie, Arthur.” Allison poured two straight ryes and smiled tiredly as he put one in front of Bard and one in front of the empty space. Bard said, “You wouldn’t rather sit in a booth, would you, Jeanie?”\n\n“What the hell do you keep asking her that, for?” Arthur said. “She never wants to sit in a booth; she always stands up here at the bar with you.”\n\nBard looked vaguely indignant. “It’s polite to ask her, Arthur.”\n\nThe stranger, a lean man in work clothes with a pinched, bitter mouth, looked with pained disgust at Frank Bard and then at Allison. “What the hell goes on?” he asked.\n\nAllison looked amused. “Oh, Frank comes in here all the time with Jeanie.”\n\nFrank Bard turned and looked at the stranger. “Jeanie and me, we like this place. She likes to come here even if 3he did have a little bad luck here a little over a year ago.”\n\nThe stranger looked into Bard’s eyes and moved back a few inches. “Bad luck?” he inquired politely.\n\n“Yeah. Jeanie was in here late one night and some lush hit her with a bottle. Hit her right over the left ear. I guess my Jeanie hasn’t got such a tough skull. Funny how it didn’t break the bottle, hey Arthur?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nJeanie\n\nJader came over, his pale eyes watering. He said, “Damn it, Arthur, what did you let this dizzy punk come in here for?”\n\nArthur grinned. “Nervous?”\n\n“No, the guy drives away trade.” He turned to the stranger. “Mister, a drunk bashed her head in with a bottle and got clean away. We give the cops a description but they never found the guy.” He paused and glanced at Bard, who was talking to Jeanie in a low voice, almost a whisper. He continued, “And this thing used to be a cop. Jeanie was his girl. He’s been on the skids for nearly a year, and every time he comes in here he’s got that damn imaginary woman with him. I tell you, it’s enough to drive me nuts.”\n\nArthur grinned tightly. “Where’s your sense of humor, Jader?”\n\nJader looked again at Bard, cursed and wandered off. The Swedes were pounding on the table.\n\nFrank Bard bent low over his glass of rye. He lifted it with a quick motion, and downed it. It caught in his throat. He gagged, but it stayed down. He stood for a moment, savoring the glow of it, feeling immediately stronger, more confident. He glanced at the wall above the back-bar, whistling softly. His lean hand, dirt stained into the knuckles, reached slowly out, shoving the empty glass over toward Jeanie. The hand hooked around her full glass and brought it back. He glanced down, as though surprised to see the full drink in front of him. He drank it with steadier hand and smiled at Jeanie.\n\n“Taste good to you, honey? If I had the dough, I’d buy you another.” He looked down at his dime change. He glanced over and said, “What was that, honey?”\n\nHe beckoned to Arthur. “Arthur, Jeanie says …”\n\n“Yeah, I know. She wants a beer chaser.” He picked up the dime, drew one beer and set it in front of Jeanie. Bard whistled again, while his right hand stole out and slid it over. He drank it quickly and, again looking at the wall, shoved the glass over in front of Jeanie.\n\nThe stranger said, “You were a cop?”\n\nBard looked at him and drew himself up, looking for a fraction of a second, out of the wise, confident policeman’s eyes. The expression faded and his eyes once more looked hot and wild. “What’s it to you!” he demanded hoarsely. “I don’t see you buying me and Jeanie no drinks; buy ’em and we’ll talk to you, Mister.” The man took hold of Bard’s shoulder with what was almost gentleness. He turned him so that he faced him directly. The work-hardened hand came across, smacking solidly, fingers open, across Bard’s jaw, knocking him against the bar. The hand came back in a backhand blow that straightened him up again, splitting his underlip at the corner.\n\nFrank Bard stood unsteadily, his hands at his side, grinning foolishly at the stranger, his eyes filling with tears from the burning pain in his lip.\n\nArthur said, “Take it easy!”\n\nThe stranger said, “That’s for being a lousy cop; that’s for nothing. You there, set up drinks for Prince Charming and his lady.”\n\n“Thanks,” Bard said humbly.\n\n“Think nothing of it, Prince.” The man turned his back.\n\nBard drank the two drinks and stood holding onto the edge of the bar. His face greyed and he said, “Excuse me, honey.”\n\nHe lurched off to the men’s room and was ill. He came out in a few minutes, still shaking, his clothes soiled and stopped by the bar. He said, “Come on, Jeanie.” He walked toward the door. Jader crossed close beside him. With wild fury, Bard grabbed Jader’s arm and spun him around. He said, “Why the hell don’t you watch where you’re going?”\n\nHe bent over suddenly, as though helping someone up from the floor. He snarled at Jader, “Okay. Okay. Go around knocking women down and don’t apologize. You all right, honey,” he said softly, making brushing motions in the air. Jader grunted, balled a large white fist and slowly drew, it back, his wet eyes narrowed.\n\nArthur snapped, “Jader! Cut it!”\n\nThe big hand unclenched and Bard walked to the door, held it open with a small bow and then walked out.\n\nJader said, “Arthur, I’m not going to stand for …”\n\n“Shut up!” The grey eyes were cold behind the lenses, the mouth a thin tight line under the mustache. The girl with the Swedes giggled shrilly. Jader turned and walked toward the back of the place.\n\nIn the alley Frank Bard stood, his hand on the corner of the packing case, looking up at the night sky. The rain had stopped and small clouds scudded across the moon. Bard dropped to his knees and crawled into the box. He lay with his face against the damp wood and tears ran down through the thick stubble on his cheeks. He reached awkwardly into his side pocket and pulled out a small package. He unwrapped the paper. It contained a small cool metal tube that still contained lipstick. Her lipstick. He held it close to his nose. It held the elusive scent of her. His fingertips touched the little skein of hair. Her hair. Long and pale and delicate—amazingly golden. He wrapped the package and replaced it in his pocket. After a long time, he slept.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Back Booth\n\nJader was in a good mood. The drawer was almost full of packages and the first pickup was due in an hour. Arthur Allison had gone to the races. It was the first time Jader had been alone in the place in many months. He liked the feeling of being trusted. The sun was hot on Dorrity Street. It slanted through the smeared front window, lighting the dim interior. One old man was asleep, his head on the booth table. Jader planned to wake him up and get him out soon.\n\nHe glanced across the street and his cheerful smile faded. He saw Frank Bard coming diagonally across the street in the sun, looking down at a spot six inches from his right shoulder. Jader could see his lips moving. Jader’s lip curled as he saw Bard’s grey, shapeless shoes, the tired scuff of his walk, the stained, baggy trousers.\n\nHe stepped over into the doorway as Bard opened the door. Jader didn’t move. Bard said, “Hey! Let us in!” He took a dollar out of his side pocket and held it up.\n\n“I don’t want no screwballs in here,” Jader said sullenly.\n\n“Where’s Arthur? Arthur lets us come in. Get out of Jeanie’s way, Jader.’\n\n“You’re not coming in.”\n\nBard stared at him for a few seconds. “Arthur won’t like to hear about this. You got a public place here.”\n\n“You stand up to the bar and talk to the other customers. The hell with that noise; you drive away business.”\n\nFrank Bard considered that statement solemnly. “Okay. So Jeanie and me, we’ll take the back booth in the end and we won’t talk to anybody, will we Jeanie?”\n\nJader glanced down the street, saw a familiar sedan coming. It would be best not to delay pickup. He moved aside. “Okay, come on in and take the end booth. I’ll be with you in a minute.”\n\nBard stood aside as though to let someone come in, and then followed. Jader waited until Bard was out of sight in the booth before slipping the package across to the slim, dark man who had ordered the beer. The man drank up and left.\n\nJader poured two ryes and walked back to the booth with them. Frank Bard smiled up at him. “No, she’s sitting right there across from me, Jader. Maybe we should take a booth oftener. It’s nice and private back here in the end. Jeanie says it’s nice and clean. Clean ashtray and everything. She don’t mind being in the booth where she got hit. Do you, Jeanie?”\n\nJader scowled. “‘The place is good and clean because I clean it. Stop the chatter and give me the buck; there’s a dime extra for table service.\n\n“But you made me come back here!”\n\n“It’s a dime extra.”\n\n“Okay, Jader. Okay.”\n\nJader rang up the half dollar and took the change back. He threw it on the table. Bard said, “The front way is the only way out, huh?”\n\n“Yeah,” he answered and walked away.\n\nHe went behind the bar and stood with his fat arms on the bar, looking gloomily across at the old man sleeping. Some of the flavor had gone out of the day with Frank Bard’s arrival. He seldom showed up in the afternoon. It was just damn bad luck that he had to pick that afternoon, Jader thought.\n\nHe scowled as he heard the low sound of Bard’s voice. Jader couldn’t imagine why Arthur permitted Bard to come around, in fact, why he seemed amused to have Bard around. It was the type of wry joke that Jader couldn’t savor.\n\nWhen he heard Bard call him hoarsely, he pushed away from the bar, drew two more ryes and walked slowly back to the booth.\n\nHe stood in front of the booth and reached out to set one rye down across from Bard. The big white hand stopped in midair and Jader stared at the ashtray. There were two butts in the ashtray. The tip of one was crimsoned with lipstick. For a moment he thought wildly that he hadn’t cleaned it. And he suddenly remembered Bard’s saying it was clean. The shot glass slipped out of his white fingers and dropped, overturning on the table.\n\n“Where’d that come from?” he said in a high, thin voice.\n\n“The cigarette butt? Jeanie smoked it.”\n\n“Don’t say that!” Jader said wildly.\n\n“Don’t you like women smoking? That’s old fashioned,” Bard said severely.\n\n“Where’d it come from?” Jader demanded again.\n\n“I told you, from Jeanie.” Bard suddenly leaned his dark head over and looked at his shoulder. He chuckled mildly. “She was sitting right beside me here with her head on my shoulder when she smoked it. Look here.” From the surface of the dark blue coat he plucked two long strands of shining gold—held them up.\n\nJader’s mouth worked and the other glass dropped at his feet.\n\nBard said, “You see, Jader, you only thought you killed her.” His tone was quiet, as though explaining to a child.\n\nJader made a strangled noise. His wet eyes widened. “I killed her. She couldn’t … . She couldn’t … .”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nJader\n\nHe turned then and looked into Frank Bard’s eyes. His underlip hung away from his teeth and he took a slow step away from the booth. Somehow Bard was in front of him. Jader clenched his white fists and struck blindly. He missed and went off balance as Frank Bard’s thin, dirty fist smashed his mouth. He fell heavily to his hands and knees, going over onto his side as one of the grey, broken shoes landed against the side of his head. One of the white hands lay, as still as lard, against the floor. Frank Bard set his heel on the fingers and swiveled his entire weight, slowly.\n\nHe walked quickly to the front door and locked it. The old mas still slept. He went behind the bar and carefully opened the drawer. Allison and Jader were cautious, watchful men—but who suspicions or fears a mad alcoholic? He set six neat packages on the top of the bar, opened the cash register and took a nickel.\n\n“Sergeant Sullivan, Police Headquarters.”\n\n“Sully, this is Frank Bard … don’t interrupt me … I’m at Allison’s Grill on Dorrity Street. I’ve just taken over the joint. Jader confessed to killing Jean Palmray. The angle is that she was trying to do some independent spying to help me along and they got wise and Jader killed her; I think he only meant to stun her. I’ve got a bunch of junk here. Six small packages. Send the boys. And have Arthur Allison picked up out at the track. Yeah.”\n\nHe hung up, walked back and looked at Jader. The man was beginning to stir. Bard kicked him in the head again and walked back to the bar. He was suddenly enormously tired. He still held the small golden tube of lipstick in his fist. He slipped it into his pocket.\n\nThey wouldn’t take a lush back on the force, even if he had done what he set out to do one year before.\n\nToo late.\n\nHe took a bottle off the back bar and pulled the patent gimmick out of the top of it and tilted it up to his lips. Drunk or sober, he had remembered to pretend that Jeanie had been with him. That was what had counted. The buildup. And after a year of buildup, Jader had cracked wide open. It had been tough, pretending that she was always beside him, looking at him.\n\nHe tilted the bottle, and as the sharp liquor filled his mouth, he felt a soft touch on his arm. He spun quickly, spraying the liquor onto the bar.\n\nThe old man was still asleep in the booth and Jader was still silent on the floor. The door was locked. In the distance an approaching siren moaned softly. The bottle slid from his nerveless fingers and shattered on the floor.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "She admitted to shooting her husband because, in her words, he was\nphoning that woman. But will the telephone bill prove his unfaithfulness\nor her error?\n\n“Still trying to be Mrs. Frack’s lawyer?” the Sheriff asked me, “Why\ndon’t you just let her alone like she wants?”\n\n“Not my idea.” I said; “her relatives want me to see what I can do.”\n\n“Well, I’ll check.” He picked up the phone. A moment later he said,\n“She’ll see you.” He looked at some letters in his hand. “It’s been a\nweek, now; maybe she’s getting lonesome.” He waved me on toward the\ndistant cell-block.\n\n“Wait a minute,” he called after me. “Here, take these to her. Probably\nsome cranks praising her for shooting her husband.” He looked at the\nfaces of the envelopes quizzically, “Some bills here, too,” he said.\n“They’re certainly sure as death and taxes, aren’t they?”\n\nI took the bundle. “They’re addressed to her home,” I said, “how did the\nmailman come to leave them here?”\n\n“It’s a small town, son; everybody knows she’s here, and why.”\n\n“Oh,” I said, “yeah. Well, I’ll take them in.”\n\n“Cleary will show you where,” the Sheriff said. “I like to stay away\nfrom those ferret-faced women much as I can.”\n\nThe Sheriff was right. Cleary showed me where, unlocking the cell for\nme; and Mrs. Frack was ferret-faced. She was attractive enough in a slim\nway, but her facial expression gave me the feeling she thought that I\nand the whole world were holding something out on her. She didn’t say\nanything about sitting down, so I handed her the mail.\n\nShe looked at it impersonally, said abruptly, “I don’t see any point in\nour talking.” She paused. “I thought if I told you that you’d leave me\nalone.”\n\n“Your brother’s folks wanted me to—” I didn’t really get started.\n\n“I shot my husband,” she said. “I shot Richard when he was phoning that\nwoman again; I couldn’t stand it any more and I killed him.”\n\nI wanted to get her talking. “Perhaps,” I said, “Mr. Frack wasn’t\ncalling a woman. Maybe it was a business call.”\n\n“At one o’clock in the morning?” There was scornful bitterness in her\nvoice. “It was a woman. I just know it was. He had taken to staying up\nlong after I went to bed just to talk to her.”\n\nShe was so intense that she convinced me that Richard Frack had\ncertainly been an indifferently faithful husband. “If it was a woman,” I\nstill reserved a final judgment, “do you have any idea who it was?”\n\n“No, but I watched him for a long time. He was acting very differently\ntoward me.” Her eyes flickered over my face as though to search out some\ndefection on my own part. “I caught him, though.”\n\nThere was a world of satisfied suspicion in her voice. “I went to bed\nand fell asleep finally; when I woke he was standing at the hall\ntelephone with the nightlight showing his face plain.”\n\nShe opened a letter with a quick probe of her nail-file. “Richard,” she\nsaid, “had a very pleased expression on his face, very pleased. Oh, he\nwas talking to her all right.”\n\n“Perhaps,” I suggested, “we might make something of a plea of temporary\ninsanity—” I got no further.\n\n“No! I went to the dresser and got his gun. I shot him just after he put\nthe phone down. He still had a satisfied smirk on his face; that’s the\nway it was.”\n\nMrs. Frack had been talking to me as if from memory. She kept flicking\nat the envelopes with her quick nail-file, briefly scanning each letter\nand putting it aside.\n\nFinally she was looking at a paper that had the crisp impersonality of a\nbill. She was very quiet; when she continued to say nothing I gently\neased the paper from her fingers. She never even noticed.\n\nIt was a telephone bill stating the monthly charges, no toll calls\nlisted. The last entry was for the 31st, the morning Richard Frack had\nbeen killed. It read with simple starkness:\n\nTime-Signal – 0.10.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "NOTE: Carolyn Wells author of more than 150 books, for the past twenty years has been well known to the American public as a writer of popular detective stories. She’s actively engaged 1’11 writing, and takes a deep interest in her chosen field in which she has made such a signal success. Our readers will be interested in what she has to say as to why this class of literature has a strong appeal to women. —Ed.\n\nWhen I was asked the question, “Why do women read detective stories?” the logical retort seemed to be, “Why not?”\n\nThen I realized that was not the answer expected of me, and I set to work to find a better one.\n\nThe traditional critic of woman’s uncertain, coy and hard to please volitions, would put it down to her craving for excitement, to her desire to bask in an artificial atmosphere that would be a distinct relief from the drudgery and drabness of her own daily life.\n\nThis, the Nineteenth Century writers informed us, was the reason for the vogue of stories of high life, of lords and ladies, and balls of dazzling light.\n\nBut present day conditions are different. Modern frankness and worldly wisdom leave little room for glamor, and relief from domestic drabness is found less vicariously than on the printed page.\n\nNor is reading today a weapon for killing time. More powerful and effective weapons are at hand in the radio, the telephone or the motor car.\n\nA possible reason for woman’s lately developed interest in detective stories may be discerned in her desire to emulate all masculine pursuits. She wanted to vote, wanted to cut her hair short, wanted to smoke, wanted to ride astride, wanted pajamas, and wanted the same untrammelled frankness of speech that man had hitherto monopolized. These things she achieved, and it may be that detective stories fell into line.\n\nFor woman’s interest in the matter is of comparatively recent growth. The lists of detective story fans, continually appearing in newspapers, includes Presidents, Prime Ministers, Kings, Statesmen, scientific giants and celebrated men of all types, but never does a woman’s name appear on those lists. We are not informed that Mrs. Hoover or Queen Mary eagerly buy thrillers at the station news stands or order them from the booksellers by half dozens.\n\nYet recent statistics compiled by the editor of this magazine, tend to show that the interest in detective fiction is about equally divided between the sexes.\n\nThis is not hard to believe when one remembers how many of our best American writers of detective stories are women.\n\nFrom the pioneer, Anna Katharine Green, on down to the most popular authors of today, there are more well-known feminine names than masculine.\n\nThat is, in America. In England, the reverse is true, and there are many more celebrated masculine pens over there writing detective fiction than feminine.\n\nAs to why women read these stories of crime and detection, various elements must enter into consideration.\n\nDoubtless the aftermath of war is to a certain extent responsible. Four years of reading thrilling news of bloodshed, heroism and horrors made ordinary stories seem humdrum and brought about a flood of books that were full of excitement.\n\nWhen the better class of writers took up these subjects and combined the horrors of murder with an intellectual interest of problem solving, the keen logical instinct usually present, even if partially dormant in the feminine mind, awoke, and women began to see that detective stories had a lure of their own, as compelling as crossword puzzles or village gossip.\n\nThe feminine mind is often quicker and more direct than a man’s mind. A woman will “cut ‘cross lots” and reach instantly a conclusion that it takes a man an appreciable time to arrive at.\n\nToo, she has, nine times out of ten, a lively curiosity that holds her interest in an absorbing story, just to see “how it will turn out.”\n\nShe loves suspense, and, as a rule, she wants to see virtue rewarded and vice punished. Her loves and hates are strong, her sympathies are staunch and loyal, and as detective stories usually turn out the way she wants them to, she is sure of a “happy ending.”\n\nSo, women are coming to realize more and more that detective stories appeal to the feminine mind that is willing to exercise its own peculiar gifts of logic and deduction.\n\nThough this is seldom an acquired taste.\n\nIf a woman really dislikes detective stories, in their essence, she will always dislike them. Not often can she be brought to change her mind.\n\nAnother reason for feminine interest is the scope for the working of their emotions.\n\nA woman may read a dozen new novels without much catching of her breath or tightening of her heartstrings.\n\nBut in a well-written detective story she finds someone to pity, someone to hate, someone to become enraged at, someone to love, and all with startling and inescapable reasons. She tingles with fear, she sighs with relief, she revels in the dangers and dilemmas, and her quick wits try to outrun the detective in his deductions and often do.\n\nShe is up against a new phase of life and it intrigues her. As for the old love stories, she knew all seven of their plots and they held no surprises for her experienced interest.\n\nBut detective stories proved a new field, and women have fallen for it.\n\nAs proof of this, note the introduction of the mystery story into the women’s magazines. Scarcely a number but has a short story or a serial instalment of a murder tale.\n\nRun over the magazines in your doctor’s or dentist’s office. The detective story pages will be worn to tatters when the informative articles still show bright, clean pages.\n\nSo far, we have considered only detective fiction.\n\nBut in fact-stories, or in current news items the principle is the same.\n\nI have heard men and women discuss celebrated murder trials as they were taking place, and always, for logical reasoning and clear understanding, the feminine mentality was abreast of the man’s mind.\n\nIntellect is impartially distributed between the sexes, and it in all ages man has achieved more lasting fame, raised to himself more enduring monuments, it is not because of a superior brain, but because of a multitude of other reasons and causes which may not be here enumerated, however.\n\nSimilarly, though women may have insight, even intuition, they are not so well fitted as men are to be detectives, which calling demands far more than mental powers.\n\nHowever, she has a right to read detective stories, a franchise she is exercising more and more freely every day. There is every reason why she should read them and no reason why she should not.\n\nTHE END\n"

He smiled a light roguish smile. The audience rippled. It was well known that Hamlet the Great, tall dark and hypnotic master of legerdemain arts, was not only magnificent where trickery and amusingly ribald patter was concerned, but was magnificent with the ladies as well.\n\nSo when a young girl in a shabby brown coat rose from her seat and, under the spell of the magician’s questing eyes, moved timidly — fearfully — down the aisle toward the ramp leading to the stage, they all tittered and settled down for something especially amusing. This was all part of the act. Naturally!\n\nHamlet took the timid girl’s hand and assisted her to an immense throne-like chair in the center of the stage.\n\n“Now, my dear,” he smiled winningly, “if you don’t mind — the hat and coat.”\n\nThe shy girl shot a terrified look at the audience. Then she slipped off her shabby coat and hat with hands that quivered.\n\n“No need to be frightened, child,” Hamlet assured her gently, surprised himself at what removal of her obnoxious hat and coat revealed.\n\nShe wore a simple peasant frock, quite unsuitable for evening wear. And this reaffirmed the audience in its judgment that this was all part of the act. But if her clothing was ordinary her beauty was not. Large lustrous blue eyes shone out of a cameo-like face. Her dark hair was like a raven’s wing, providing a halo-like line for her graceful, pale neck and throat. Her bosom heaved with excitement.\n\n“B-but —”\n\nHamlet smiled encouragingly.\n\n“Sit down, child. Tell us your name.”\n\nShe slid into the chair, clutching its arms. The terror showed itself again as she stared into that ocean of watching eyes.\n\n“I — I’m sorry. My name is Julia. Julia Courtney.”\n\nHamlet bowed low.\n\n“Thank you, Julia. Now, what I propose to do is to conduct an experiment in simple hypnotism. I wish to perform a feat I first learned when I was in India. Did you know that I studied Yogi in India for three years Julia?”\n\nShe shook her head. The audience laughed. This was typical Hamlet routine.\n\nHamlet nodded gravely. “But first I must obtain your unqualified approval. Are you entirely willing, may I probe into the secrets of your mind, Julia — or shall I find another assistant?”\n\nJulia hesitated. She half rose, then sank back in the great chair. Wearing that loose filmy blouse and tight-waisted peasant skirt, she looked like a child. She seemed to search Hamlet’s face intently, then she nodded.\n\n“Go ahead. I’m ready.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nSomething Unright About This Girl\n\nHamlet slipped a ring on his middle finger, a ring with a large blood-red stone in it, that seemed to be a living flame. Julia couldn’t help staring at it. Hamlet nodded his approval and began to make rhythmic movements with his expressive hands, quite unnecessarily, but the audience liked that sort of thing. They enjoyed the sensation of watching him put this slip of a girl under his spell; it appealed to some covert sadism in them.\n\n“You are becoming very tired,” Hamlet told her. “Very, very tired. You want to sleep. Sleep. Sleep …”\n\nHer eyelids fluttered unwillingly while she stared at that chunk of bloody flame that floated before her eyes. Then she sighed, and fell back.\n\n“Do you hear me, Julia?” Hamlet asked, after a moment.\n\n“Y-Yes.”\n\n“Will you answer my questions?”\n\n“Yea.”\n\n“Fine. Tell us how old you are, child.”\n\n“Eighteen.”\n\n“What is your position in life? What do you do?”\n\n“I — I am a receptionist in a — a mortuary on Washington Boulevard.”\n\nShe shuddered involuntarily. Hamlet’s forehead corrugated. There was something unright about this girl, a mystery that hovered over her head like an unholy halo. He’d sensed it the moment she stepped on the stage. That livid fear in her eyes was more than stage fright.\n\nHe asked softly, “Why did you come into the theatre? You are not dressed for the theatre.”\n\nJulia’s face twisted, became luminous with the urgency of her fear.\n\n“Today was my day off. I — I was going home from just window shopping on the Boulevard. Then I knew I was being followed. I could see him — a big, ugly man. I got panicky. Then I saw this place, and bought a ticket. I thought I could escape him in the darkness. Then — I saw him come in. He took a seat right behind me. He kept staring at me. I — I didn’t know what to do, then — when you called for an assistant, I came up here. I thought you might help me. He means to kill me. You must help me!”\n\n“Of course I will, Julia,” Hamlet said calmly. “Now tell me, very carefully — who is this ugly man who you think is following you? And why —\n\nJulia was rising stiffly to her feet. She stared straight ahead of her, “He — he has a knife!” she whispered dryly. Then she slipped quietly to the floor in a dead faint.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Waitful Hearse\n\nIt is HIGHLY likely that no other man of the theatre could have hypnotized this packed house into believing everything was going per plan. No one but Hamlet the Great. First thing they knew the girl was gone and they were laughing at something droll Hamlet was saying. While the scene was being shifted and gay music covered the momentary confusion, Hamlet whispered to the husky young assistant with the flaming red hair who had whisked Julia offstage, “Take her to my dressing room and stay with her every second. Oh yes, Tippy. You’d better call Lieutenant Reeves at Headquarters.”\n\nYoung Tippy gave him a wry look that asked indignantly how he could stay with the girl and also be calling headquarters, but, with a sweep of his black cloak, Hamlet had moved back on stage.\n\nFor the balance of the show, although his hands were as uncannily adroit as ever in covering the trickery behind each illusion, and his patter was as polished and brilliant as ever, Hamlet’s mind was busy wondering what lay behind the terror in Julia Courtney’s eyes — and who the man with the knife could be.\n\nAvoiding supernumerary bows he whipped backstage toward hit dressing room to find out. He met Tippy coming around a corner from the opposite direction.\n\n“Why aren’t you guarding her?” he demanded.\n\n“I had to phone Reeves, didn’t I, boss?” Tippy sulked. “Then I took a peek out front to see if I could locate the creep with the shiv. Uh-uh.”\n\n“And the girl?”\n\n“Asleep on the couch. Say, boss, she sure is —”\n\n“Never mind. Did she awaken at all?”\n\n“Uh-uh. But she kept talking in her sleep. All she kept saying was one word. Sounded like ‘stork.’ What d’you suppose she meant, boss?” Tippy’s face dropped. “You don’t think she’s going to have a —”\n\n“No, Tippy,” Hamlet reassured his romance-minded assistant as he pushed into his dressing room.\n\nHis face went to stone as he stared down at an empty couch. Behind him Tippy gave a yelp and made for the clothes closet to find the girl. But Hamlet saw the wide-open window at once. He was through it in no time, sprinting down the dark cobbled alley like a great bat. Ahead of him a bulky shadow was lumbering toward a long black hearse parked near the alley-mouth. The shadow packed a girl on its shoulder so it couldn’t move very fast.\n\nHamlet reached them a few yards from the waitful hearse. He spun the big man around, applying his fist to the center of a round bristling face. The man grunted and dropped his burden. He started swinging.\n\nThe darkness didn’t confirm the man’s ugliness, but he certainly was big. But Hamlet was no mean pugilist, and his proficiency at the gentle art of judo was the talk of Hollywood. The big man’s haymakers could have flattened a middle-size elephant, but where they lauded Hamlet just wasn’t. Inside three minutes the big man was flat on his back in the alley muck. Hamlet was about to pick up the unconscious girl when a gun flamed from the interior of the black chariot of death.\n\nThat was as much as Hamlet decided just before he decided to fall forward on the cobbles and leave this vale of tears to its own devices.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nStork … Stoack\n\n“Boss! Wake up — please wake up!”\n\nTippy’s snubby face was tearful with his contrition and inward fear.\n\n“You gotta be all right!” he said stubbornly.\n\n“Well, if you say so, Tippy.”\n\nHamlet smiled wanly as he sat up and looked about him. He was on his dressing room couch and his flamingheaded assistant was hanging over him like a mother hen with a sick chick. Hamlet stood up and reassured himself that the door of the dressing room was locked against intrusion, reached a cigarette out of Tippy’s convenient pocket and lit it. Tippy gaped.\n\n“Why, you ain’t hurt!” he cried.\n\n“Hardly even dead.”\n\n“Then what’s the idea of scaring me —”\n\n“Tippy,” Hamlet inquired gravely, “in what commodity does your boss deal?”\n\nTippy cogitated hard. “Tricks and illusions,” he exclaimed brightly.\n\nHamlet nodded. “Exactly. And just at this moment I wish to create the illusion that I am dead.”\n\n“Why?” Tippy demanded bluntly. Hamlet inhaled thoughtfully. “Because the mystery of Julia Courtney intrigues me. If offers relief from the boredom that infests my humdrum existence.”\n\nIgnoring the broad grin that swept over Tippy’s face he went on. “Besides, she is in deadly danger at this moment. Wants rescuing in the very worst way.”\n\n“What way is that, boss?” Tippy asked flippantly.\n\n“My way.”\n\n“Then you believe all that stuff she said?”\n\n“Implicitly. And here is what I intent to do about it. By a trick of suspended animation I learned while I was in India — I really was, you know — I propose to simulate death. You will have my body sent to a mortuary at once …”\n\nTippy displayed one of his rare flashes of brilliance. “To the mortuary she worked at!”\n\n“Tippy, you really are amazing. Will you let me be your assistant?”\n\nTippy blushed scarlet. “Aw shucks. Boss —”\n\n“That mortuary on Washington Boulevard,” Hamlet said briskly, “is undoubtedly the seat of Julia’s trouble, and the hearse indicates it beyond any logical doubt. Now a living man caught snooping around there is liable to become a dead one before he has done much rescuing. Whereas a dead man —”\n\n“Nobody’s going to worry about another stiff in a joint that’s full of them!” Tippy chuckled. Then he grimaced unhappily. “But, Boss — we don’t know which mortuary it is! There must be thirty or forty of ‘em on Washington Boulevard. Why, there’s more dead people over there than live ones!”\n\nHamlet crushed his smoke thoughtfully.\n\n“There is much merit in what you say. Tippy. But — wait! We have one clew! That word she kept repeating in her sleep — what was it?”\n\n“Stork. But —”\n\n“Stork. Um. Reach me the yellow telephone book like a good boy.”\n\nTippy hiked over to the reference shelf Hamlet kept handy and took down the ponderous Los Angeles Classified directory. He handed it to his boss, his face gloomy and unhopeful. Hamlet took no notice. He whirred cheerfully to the section on Funeral Homes.\n\n“Stark, Seeley, Simms,” he recited. “Siverman, Stevens, Stoack … Stoack!”\n\nHe looked at Tippy.\n\nTippy blinked uncertainly a moment, then nodded furiously.\n\n“Sure, Boss! That’s it, that’s it!”\n\n“Goody, goody. Stoack Mortuary it is.”\n\nThere came a loud, official-sounding knock on the door.\n\n“That must be Lieutenant Reeves. Took him long enough to get fifteen blocks. Well, might as well let him in. He’ll have to be in on my — er — demise.”\n\nTippy didn’t look happy about what his boss proposed to do.\n\n“Is it really necessary, Boss?” he grumbled.\n\n“Yes, Tippy.”\n\nTippy sniffed and rubbed his nose indignantly as he headed for the door, which was being hanged on by this time.\n\n“Okay, Boss. It’s — it’s your funeral.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Mortuary\n\nHamlet the great lay stiff and immobile on his slab in the mortuary, he could see nothing but the darkness inside his eyelids. He would rely on his acute auditory and olfactory senses. The latter presented him nothing pleasant — the antiseptic odor of the white sheet that covered him; while his ears told him there was someone with him in the long room. Clumping feet shuffled back and forth while the man in the room strained and grunted over the weight of heavy boxes or coffins. He was humming, Be Glad When You’re Dead, You Rascal You.\n\nHamlet’s plan had moved, so far at least, with ridiculous smoothness. Not a hitch anywhere. Here he was, in the back room of Stoack’s Mortuary, ostensibly awaiting the ministrations of the undertaker’s needles and knives. Stoack was away somewhere, and an assistant named Hollis was in charge.\n\nTippy and Lieutenant Reeves had both fought against his idea, but Hamlet insisted. A fake death certificate was provided, and by use of an Indian drug and self-hypnosis he had brought about his present alarming condition — giving the appearance of a handsome, well-dressed cadaver.\n\nInside two hours the effect of the drug that made his flesh assume a cold, dead appearance would wear off. Then he would be able to open his eyes first. Then move his lips and shift his hands and head and legs, little by little, until full normal functioning power was resumed. Until that time his danger was very great. What if that assistant decided to start working on him before the two hours was up … ?\n\nHe had garnered meager information about Stoack and his mortuary from Lieutenant Reeves. The mortuary was small. As far as was known there were only four men connected with it — Stoack, Hollis, and two ambulance men. The pug-ugly he slugged in the alley was undoubtedly one of the latter. Stoack had operated his establishment only eight months or so, yet they seemed to do a rushing business in transferring bodies from one place to another. Funerals were far between. The police had nothing on him.\n\n*  *  *  *  *\n\nHamlet estimated while he was being carried down the room that it was perhaps thirty feet long, but narrow, and at the far end was a little cubicle like an office, possessing a squeaky desk chair. From the noise the shuffler was making there seemed to be a prodigious number of coffins and crates around — particularly for a funeral parlor that rarely conducted funerals.\n\nSomebody came in and spoke to the shuffler. Hamlet strained to catch every word.\n\n“Haven’t you got that stuff put away in the lockup yet, Burke?”\n\nHamlet recognized Hollis, the assistant’s shrill lisp.\n\n“Only got two hands,” Burks growled. “Let somebody else do a little of this night work.”\n\n“Suppose you mean Graven. Jed drove down over the border with the boss to help with the new shipment. Stoack isn’t going to love you any more if he walks in and finds out the last one is still up here in these coffins.”\n\nBurke swore. “I copped that nosey dame, didn’t I — before she could sing? And I put that magician on a slab where he won’t get any ideas, didn’t I?”\n\n“With my help,” Hollis lisped.\n\nBurke swore again. “How about helping me tuck these hot goods to bed, eh?”\n\n“No. I have to get back to Angela. She mustn’t escape again.”\n\n“You gonna slip her the business, Hollis?”\n\n“Of course not. I told the boss what was up when he phoned from Cicci’s, and he told me to hold off until he gets back. He’s got something special on his mind.”\n\n“When’s he getting back?” Burke complained. “I need Graven to help me with this junk?”\n\n“They’ll be here any minute. Better get busy,” Hollis warned, and left.\n\nBurke went back to work. He seemed to be removing something from boxes and carrying it down a stairway and depositing it, piece by piece, in some secret hold. Things were moving fast. Hamlet knew the time for action was at hand — before Stoack and the other hood got back. He fought to move, to release his muscles from the invisible restraint of that drug. For a second he thought he was making it. His eyelid flickered. Then he heard a door slam in front. He relaxed, went dead again.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nFaker\n\nMultiple feet tramped in. He heard a new voice, a crisp dominating voice. This must be Jorg Stoack.\n\nStoack said, “Where is he?”\n\n“Here under this sheet,” Hollis lisped complacently.\n\nHamlet felt it when the white sheet covering him was flicked off. He felt somebody bend over him and probe him with eyes and with hands.\n\n“What killed him?” Stoack snapped.\n\n“Lead poisoning,” Hollis tittered. “I shot him.”\n\n“Did you examine the wound?”\n\n“Superficially. The red-head stooge of his cleaned it up pretty well — him or the doctor who signed the death certificate.”\n\n“What doctor?”\n\n“Why — Dr. Brogas. Simon Brogas, it says on the certificate.”\n\n“You idiot!”\n\n“W-What’d you mean, boss?” Hollis squeaked.\n\nStoack didn’t bother to answer. He was unbuttoning Hamlet’s shirt, ripping off the tape that hid an apparently fatal bullet-wound.\n\n“Just as I thought! Hollis, you’re a blundering fool!” Stoack tore into his assistant in a very uncomplimentary manner.\n\n“What’s up?” Burke edged in curiously. “Ain’t he dead enough for you, boss?”\n\n“He’s not dead at all,” Stoack rasped. “This is Hamlet the Great. I saw him pull a suspended animation act in London years ago that would have made Houdini look second rate. No. He’s far from dead enough to suit me, Burke. But he will be. He will be\n\n*  *  *  *  *\n\nHamlet felt pain drive through him as the mortician’s fist crashed down on his face. He felt the shock of it down to his heels and that told him the effect of the drug was wearing off fast.\n\n“Open your eyes, you faker!” Stoack snarled.\n\nHe started slapping Hamlet’s face viciously with the back of his hand. Hamlet remained immobile. He let his head flop loosely from side to side under the lashing, fighting to keep under that curtain drug. Finally the agony was over, and Stoack panted, “He must have taken some drug to make him look so dead. It hasn’t worn off yet. He’ll keep. You come with me, Hollis.”\n\n“Let me kill him,” Hollis begged emotionally.\n\n“No! I want him to be able to feel it.”\n\n“What you gonna do, boas?” Burke gloated.\n\n“He came here as a corpse. I have a bonafide death certificate. What do you think I’ll do? I’m going to treat him just as I would any corpse — only he is going to have full use of his senses, so that he can enjoy the experience to the fullest!”\n\nHe said something about an early funeral that made Hollis titter, as they walked away. Hamlet was beginning to think his ruse had worked when Stoack called back, “Oh, Burke.”\n\n“Yeah, boss?”\n\n“Never mind those coffins. Keep your gun on him. If he moves, get him.”\n\n“He won’t play none of his tricks on me,” Burke vowed.\n\nHalf an hour went by with agonising slowness. It was as if time had turned to rubber and was stretching each second into an hour. As the drug wore off it became almost impossible for Hamlet to retain his corpse-like rigidity. His skin prickled and itched. He yearned to stretch his arms and legs, to so much as move one finger would have been heaven. But he didn’t dare. He could hear Burke breathing, as he sat on a propped-up box at Hamlet’s feet, watching him doggedly, gun in hand.\n\nSo vivid were Hamlet’s hearing powers by now that he was aware of every movement that thug made. And when he was certain Burke had shifted his glance away, yawning, he let one eyelid raise a little. Yes. Now was his chance.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nThe Funeral at Greenwood Cemetery\n\nWhen Burke looked back at him — he’d only closed his eyes a couple seconds — he blinked and rubbed them in surprise. He gaped down at the big ring that had blossomed on Hamlet’s finger in that interim. Hamlet’s hands were folded across his chest as before, but now his middle finger wore a ring with a flashing blood-red stone in it. Fascinated, Burke shifted his gun to his left hand, and started to take the ring off Hamlet’s finger. By muscular control Hamlet kept it tight.\n\nBurke growled and set down his gun.\n\nNow Hamlet moved. Like forked lightning his arms went up, entwining lovingly around the thug’s neck. But his embrace was anything but gentle as he vised that ugly head in the crook of his elbow and squeezed, while his left hand clapped over Burke’s mouth to halt a surprised yelp.\n\n“Be a good boy, bad boy,” Hamlet told him crisply, “If you don’t want to crowd up one of those fake coffins. Now — tell me where your boss went!”\n\n“I — I dunno,” Burke choked.\n\nTears sprang from his eyes when Hamlet applied pressure. He moaned, strangledly, “Funeral — Greenwood Cemetery.”\n\nThen he collapsed.\n\nIt was useless to question him further. He was out for a long, long time. And time was precious. Hamlet took a moment to verify some suspicions that had been sprouting in his mind in regard to the coffins Burke had been working on, and the hidden cache under the trapdoor in the floor, then he found his coat and hat and cane — and started away.\n\n*  *  *  *  *\n\nThe mortuary was a dead place. Quite evidently Hollis and the thug called Graven were with Stoack at Greenwood. The sickly light of false dawn flickered morbidly through the high opaque windows as Hamlet hurried across the long room to the outside door. He shivered in the grip of an overwhelming sense of defeat at the thought that he had failed Julia Courtney …\n\nOut on Washington Boulevard, he hailed a lonely cab that floated like an aimless derelict on that silent ocean of morning fog. He told the driver, “Greenwood Cemetery — hurry!”\n\nThe little man in front gulped, “Yessir,” and sent the cab scuttling down the boulevard. He kept staring at his fare through the little mirror. Hamlet smiled wanly, realizing that the pallid make-up he had on to help the illusion of death, as well as his magician’s dress-suit and cloak, that he looked like Dracula in a hurry to get back to hit grave before dawn.\n\nGreenwood was one of the smaller of the old cemeteries, located next to a golf course on the rolling Westwood hills. Through sentinel palms and fringed eucalyptus Hamlet glimpsed a sombre knot of people moving across the lawns toward an open grave. At the entrance to the cemetery was an empty hearse which bore, in polished chrome lettering, the words Stoack Mortuary.\n\nAs Hamlet stepped out and tossed the hackie a bill, he said, “Listen, find a telephone and call — never mind!”\n\nHis roving eye had sighted a dark blue sedan he recognized as Lieutenant Reeves’ unofficial police car. If Reeves was on hand, Tippy was not far away, either. He hurried through the wrought-iron gates and skirted the ancient gravestones across a wet green earth to which clung a shroud-like mist in the direction of that little funeral circle.\n\n“Boss!” It was Tippy who was running at him and pumping his hand, half-hysterical with relief.\n\n“How did you get here?” Hamlet demanded.\n\n“We followed them!” Tippy pointed at the funeral circle, from which came a murmurous minister’s voice and a low sobbing of a woman. “We thought —”\n\n“I understand.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nA Good Samaritan\n\nTippy was leading him off to one side behind an immense oleander tree where Reeves and two of his plain-clothes associates were holding council. Reeves’ wide, homely face lighted up when he saw the magician.\n\n“I see you’re alive again.”\n\n“So it seems.”\n\nHamlet gestured quickly at the funeral group. “What’s all that?”\n\n“Strictly on the level,” Reeves told him grumpily. “We had a look in the coffin. Half expected to find you in it. That’s why we followed them out here. It’s just a little old lady. Her sister hadn’t any money, so when Stoack — good Samaritan that he is — offered to give her a simple funeral without charge she naturally — Hey! What’s the matter with you?”\n\nHamlet was grabbing his arm.\n\n“They’ve started to lower the coffin! You’ve got to stop them!”\n\nReeves snorted, “I will not! I’ve already made a fool of —”\n\nHamlet wasn’t listening any longer. He was sprinting through the group and telling the four men in black to put down the coffin.\n\nStoack’s voice burst out, “This is outrageous!”\n\nHamlet whirled on him. He saw a stout man in a frock coat, with puffy black-rimmed eyes that reminded him of a cobra’s. A long, emaciated creep with thin blonde hair and a twitchy chin who stood next to Stoack was, he decided, the assistant, Hollis.\n\nBefore anyone could move Hamlet had slipped the thin blade concealed in his cane out of its sheath and had pried the cheap coffin top open. There, on a satiny lining, lay the shrivelled body of an old woman. Hamlet turned to the black-veiled lady who was sobbing.\n\n“I know you will forgive me when you understand why I am doing this.”\n\nHe lifted the frail body out gently and set it across his cloak. Then he knelt and ripped the satin lining out of the coffin. Reeves was beside him, protesting, by now.\n\n“Look!” Hamlet told him. “False bottom — like the ones in the mortuary!” His sensitive fingers probed for and found a catch that opened the false bottom. Then he was reaching inside, lifting the slim body of Julia Courtney out of it.\n\n“She’s alive!” he exclaimed. “Take care of her, somebody.”\n\nAcross the open grave Stoack had pulled a revolver out of his frock coat and was pointing it at him. Never had Hamlet seen such demonaic hate in a human being’s eyes. He lifted to his feet as Stoack fired. The bullet skimmed his arm. Hamlet faced Stoack with sublime calm.\n\n“Just the sadistic sort of thing you would think of — burying her alive — I ought to have known when I found out what you intended for me!”\n\nStoack’s face was insane as he fired, again and again. Hamlet seemed to melt easily away from each deadly bullet With a snarl Stoack leaped at hit throat, leaped right on the cane-sword Hamlet held. He made a gurgling sound, then toppled back heavily into the grave he had planned so carefully for Julia Courtney.\n\n*  *  *  *  *\n\n“So that was it,” Reeves said, after they had assured themselves Julia Courtney was resting easily in the receiving hospital they brought her to. “Stoack was a smuggler.”\n\nHamlet nodded.\n\n“Narcotics, mostly. He brought them over the border, and distributed them with his hearses. I found out that his coffins have false bottoms. He even used fiendishly-real wax dummies as a cover. A quick look would fool anybody, and most people aren’t anxious to investigate hearses too closely.\n\nThat is where he had a peculiar advantage. Then, of course, he would have an occasional funeral, so as to make everything look kosher.”\n\n“How about the girl?”\n\n“She was part of the setting, too. Seeing her in his reception room would convince anyone. Only Julia must have stumbled across something that spelled danger for them. Stoack decided she must be gotten rid of — and figured out that clever scheme of burying her with the pauper lady. You telling me about Stoack’s good Samaritan deed tipped me off. I was reasonably certain that Mr. Stoack wasn’t giving away anything for free — anything except death.”\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "When, at fourteen, Don began to work at the Arcadia Grocery, a whole new wonderful world opened up to him; and not the least of its delights was the sense of worldliness he rapidly acquired, a sophistication beyond his years, with its attendant pleasurable notion that he had already seen enough of life to disillusion him with a certain well-known institution.\n\nHe came to work as soon as school was out at three-thirty, and worked until the store closed at six; but on Saturday it was all day, from seven-thirty in the morning till ten-thirty at night. He loved it. He liked his two employers very much, the partners Mr. Heflfelfingcr and Mr. Kunkel; they were awfully good to him, and treated him as an equal.\n\nHe loved, too, the importance of being behind a counter to so many people he had known all his life, and who had, till now, regarded him as a kid. And he loved all the gossip; the secret lives of friend and stranger alike were openly discussed in his presence as though he wasn’t fourteen at all, and he soon learned to join in the general, ribald amusement that seemed to be universal in the grown-up world and occupy the greater part of their conversation.\n\nIt was quite different from the veiled allusions he often overheard at home, when his mother uttered half a sentence and then cut herself off with a sigh and a headshake over the carryings-on of one of their neighbors; or when his father laughed outright over some tidbit he had brought home but which he only fully disclosed to Don’s mother when he himself was out of hearing.\n\nAt the Arcadia Grocery gossip was not only openly rife but there was something even better: if you kept your eyes and ears open, actual evidences were all around you of the choice scandals from which that gossip Sprang. Like Mrs. Corbin, for instance, and the telephone.\n\nMrs. Corbin was an attractive, neat woman, married to Joe Corbin who repaired watches at Platt the Jeweler’s. She had a pleasant open smile, impersonal eyes, and wonderful eyebrows, plucked and pencilled, that rose in twin symmetrical arcs almost to the brim of her close-fitting felt hat, giving her a provocative, surprised look.\n\nEvery afternoon about four, Mrs. Corbin came into the store and bought her two pounds of sugar; it was during the war with the Kaiser, and the sale of sugar was strictly kept to two pounds per day per customer. Then she would linger at the counter for a while, chatting amiably as if she had all the time in the world; but it was clear to Don’s fast-maturing perceptions that Mrs. Corbin had other things on her mind besides the small talk; that her thoughts were elsewhere.\n\nDon had got so used to measuring out the regulation two pounds of sugar that he could do it accurately, almost every time, without weighing it. He took the aluminum scoop, dug into the big sugar barrel that swung from below the counter on a squeaking arm-like arrangement, held the scoop high in the air, and let the sugar fall beautifully into the paper sack, which he had already whipped open with a professional flip of his left hand; then he plunked the bag onto the scales, watched the needle wag to and for for a second, and there it was: two pounds even. He folded the flap doubly over the top, wound the white string twice around the sack, and breaking the string with a smart quick yank, he handed the sugar over to Mrs. Corbin. And then she would say, every darned afternoon — the arched eyebrow’s rippling higher and the cool impersonal eyes gazing directly into his: “Oh, I just remembered! May I use the phone a minute, please?”\n\n“Why certainly,” Don would say, never batting an eye, “just help yourself, Mrs. Corbin.” Then, because he knew what was coming and, as became a man of the world, must be discreet, he turned back to the sugar barrel and tossed off a few more two-pound bags, in readiness for the next customers who asked for them.\n\nMrs. Corbin stepped to the wall telephone with the goose neck a few feet away, picked up the phone book that hung from a cord beside it, and opening the directory to somewhere in the middle, she would peer intently at the long list of names there and run an inquiring finger slowly down the page.\n\n“Mrs. … Mrs. … Mrs. … Mrs. …” she would murmur, just loud enough for him to hear, and then give Central the number in lowered tones that could not be heard at all.\n\nDon smiled to himself. He knew what the number was — 424, Mersey’s saloon; and Mrs. Corbin was calling up Mr. Mersey to find out when he was to be free and where she was to pick him up this time, before they drove out to the pines after supper to park for awhile after dark. He knew this because Mr. Heffelfinger had told him, with a hearty laugh, that that’s what was going on; and now, after so many afternoons of “Mrs. … Mrs. … Mrs. … Mrs. …” he could see it for himself. He was entranced. He would love to have told his father and mother, but of course they would only have said he was taking a great deal for granted, smarty, a very great deal indeed, and had a dirty mind besides. Instead, he told three or four of his friends in High School, and together they laughed and laughed.\n\nWithin a few weeks after he had started at the Arcadia Grocery, Mr. Heffelfinger suddenly changed Don’s dinner hour on Saturday noon. At first, he had gone home to dinner at eleven-thirty when Mr. Kunkel did, returning at twelve-thirty to relieve Mr. Heffelfinger and Jake, the other assistant. Now, for a reason that wasn’t at once clear to Don, Mr. Heffelfinger asked him to switch places with Jake, and Jake went home for dinner at the same time as Mr. Kunkel. This left Mr. Heffelfinger and Don alone together during the noon hour, a time of day when hardly anybody ever came into the store at all. But one of these few was Miss Bye, who invariably arrived a few minutes after Jake and Mr. Kunkel had gone home.\n\nMiss Bye was a very short, very fat woman of maybe fifty, with hair dyed a lifeless jet-black like a wig, and puffy checks coated with talcum powder so thick that she looked as if she had just recovered from having her face stuck in the flour barrel in the back room. She wore a single large pearl on each car lobe, and her pudgy hands glittered with rings. In her shiny silk dress of a changeable coppery color, she swelled outward in front like a pouter pigeon and in back like a lawn roller, and she had been stuffed so tightly into her iridescent dress that she looked like a gorgeous pincushion.\n\n“Ahhh, Miss Bye,” Mr. Heffelfinger would say, surprised; and after the barest word or two about the weather, he would draw his order pad from the pocket of his cotton apron-gown and remove the indelible pencil from behind his ear.\n\n“And what will it be today. Miss Bye?”\n\nIt was always a nice piece of salt pork, not too fat and not too lean, or a quart of molasses, or some sour pickles or new potatoes — something, at any rate, that would take them down to the cellar.\n\nMr. Heffelfinger was very fat himself, and fiftyish, too; but he was a nice man, a really kind man, and Don was fond of him. He had silver-gray hair and small, merry, blue eyes, and until Don got onto the situation between him and Miss Bye, he had always thought of Mr. Heffelfinger as a kind of ideal father, except that his own father, so stern but so good, was better.\n\nBut he was not in the least shocked or even dismayed. With his newfound sophistication he shrugged and smiled to himself, and thought: Well, that’s the way of the world, there’s marriage for you all right all right … .\n\nAnd wisely, as Mr. Heffelfinger expected him to do, he pretended to notice nothing. The presence of Jake, it seemed, had proved inconvenient.\n\nBut all the same, there was occasionally an awkward moment, a moment that Don retailed hilariously at school on Monday morning. When, as sometimes happened, a customer came in during the noon hour and innocently asked for a piece of salt pork or a pint of pickles, all the resources of Don’s ripening experience had to be brought into play. As he approached the stairs that led down to the cellar, he began to whistle Over There or Keep the Home Fires Burning or something else that he could whistle equally loud; and as he reached the bottom step he would even burst into song.\n\nA second or two later he came upon Mr. Heffelfinger and Miss Bye, standing, a careful couple of feet apart, beside the molasses barrel or the potato bin — under the harsh glare of the single electric bulb Mr. Heffelfinger’s round face was purple as an eggplant, his forehead streamed with sweat, and Miss Bye’s lustrous billowing bosom pantingly rose and fell.\n\nMr. Heffelfinger bent forward slightly from the waist, all attention and business, the order pad held in his raised palm with the indelible pencil poised above it, while he murmured: “And perhaps, Miss Bye, I might also suggest some Bermuda onions? We have some beauties, just in the other day …\n\nDon walked by acutely self-conscious, his eyes straight ahead; but on the way back upstairs he was already grinning, and he thought gleefully to himself: Boy! won’t Ernie and Eddie and Harry love this! …\n\nSo life at the Arcadia Grocery went on, wonderful as ever. Besides giving him the chance of being in on the exciting events of the adult world, it had other delights, of course. Don loved to amaze a customer with his lightning calculation of the cost of 6 1/2 pounds of bananas, for instance, at 8 1/2 cents a pound, a customer, that is, who didn’t know that this total was simultaneously registered, along with the weight, on the reverse side of the horizontal cylinder above the scales.\n\nDuring an idle moment he loved to stand in the front window looking through the spray of the tiny fountain that squealed faintly like a distant peanut wagon and kept the lettuce and spinach fresh, and wave to friends who went by on Main Street. Every time he passed the cold meat counter he gave the handle of the slicer a spin and helped himself to a fresh slice of boiled ham or dried beef. When a customer asked if the cheese was strong today, he cut off a small piece with the tremendous cleaver-like knife, sampled it himself, then pronounced the verdict with authority.\n\nAnd he early loved the long, democratic Saturday evenings when the store filled up with farmers and their families, loud with greetings and news as if they hadn’t laid eyes on one another for months, chattering away in their Holland-Dutch accents and generously accepting him as one of themselves.\n\nMeanwhile Mrs. Corbin continued to run her finger down the open page of the telephone book in the afternoon and murmur aloud, “Mrs. … Mrs. … Mrs. … Mrs. … “\n\nMr. Heffelfinger and Miss Bye continued to go down cellar on Saturday noon and inspect the salt pork together; Mrs. Hanks continued to climb the stairs to Dr. Wallace’s office above the store on Saturday nights after office hours were long since over and Mr. Hadley continued not too surreptitiously to pay Mrs. Denton’s exorbitant grocery bills and the good-looking Mrs. Burton Slade, emerging from the store, continued to be picked up at the curb with not at all surprising frequency by Mr. Cunningham or his well-paid chauffeur Art Holmes, who, by the greatest good fortune for the package-laden Mrs. Slade, just happened to be passing by at that very moment; items, all, to be relished and hooted over with Harry and Eddie and Ernie . . .\n\nOne afternoon, Mr. Heffelfinger came from the phone and said: “Don, will you run over to Mrs. Oliver’s with this vanilla like a good boy? She’s making a sponge cake for supper and needs it right away.”\n\n“Sure thing. Be back in a jiffy — for the Olivers lived less than a block away. He stuck the bottle of vanilla in his apron pocket and went out; and it was fun going along the street in his long work-gown with The Arcadia Grocery stencilled on both the front and back.\n\n“Come in, Donnie boy,” Mrs. Oliver sang out nasally from the kitchen as he came up the back steps.\n\nMrs. Oliver was a florid-faced woman of about forty with a dumpy figure, from eating too much candy, it was said, and she talked through her nose with a whine that grated on the car; but she was a good soul, the kind that people spoke of as “harmless” and “well-meaning,” and Don had always thought her quite nice.\n\n“Come on into the den a minute, why don’t you?” she said. “I want to show you my new books. You like books, I know.”\n\n“Thank you, Mrs. Oliver, I’d like to.”\n\nThey entered the den and she waved her hand toward a series of bookshelves along one wall.\n\n“I had it all done over by that man at Sibley, Lindsey &amp;amp; Curr,” she said.\n\n“Very nice.”\n\n“I knew you’d be impressed,” she said.\n\nBut he was not looking at the bookshelves. His eye was caught by a pendant hanging from her plump neck, with a large yellow stone that might have been a topaz. He peered at it, and then said: “Gee, that looks like a nice stone, Mrs. Oliver. Pretty, too.”\n\n“This old lavaliere? You like it?” She bent her head to look at the pendant, and the double chins spread upward toward her cheeks. Then she smiled and said: “Tell you a little secret, Donnie. Just between you and I. You know who gave me that lavaliere? Your father.”\n\nDon felt the hot red flush rise upward from his neck to his very ears, but Mrs. Oliver didn’t notice.\n\n“And look,” she went on, reaching toward the table for a candy box inlaid with different-colored woods in such a way as to depict the Statue of Liberty, with a tugboat in the foreground.\n\n“He gave me this, too; isn’t it cunning? Couple of years ago your father was mighty sweet on me, for a while.”\n\n“I’ve got to go now, Mrs. Oliver,” he said. “I got to get back …”\n\nAnd as he walked in through the front door of the Arcadia Grocery he saw Mr. Heffelfinger, whose face could get so purple in the cool cellar, bending toward Mrs. Newman with order pad and pencil in hand. You old fool, Don said under his breath, bitterly: You miserable, hypocritical, sweaty, purple old fool … .\n\nTHE END\n"

He picked one out.\n\n“Here’s a couple of hard-looking bozos from Frisco … Peter and Martin Carson … they were golf caddies … graduated into highway robbery and murder at one jump.\n\nBrained a guy on the golf links with a mid-iron. Damn fool was carrying twelve grand around with him and these brothers found out about it. According to this, they were heading East — probably for New York.”\n\nHe passed the circular to Inspector Tim Kelleher. Over the inspector’s shoulder his brother-in-law, Lieutenant Jimmy Mersereau, scrutinized the pictures of the two wanted men.\n\n“Might be coming here instead of New York,” commented Jimmy. “Hot in New York — mighty cool and pleasant in the Berkshire Hills.”\n\nKelleher’s thoughtful silence attracted the chief’s attention. He asked, “What’s bitin’ you, Tim?”\n\n“The mug on the older one reminds me a little of a guy I saw — - let’s see when was it? — day before yesterday — in front of 441 Wyona Street where Tom Shaw is the super. Prob’ly just a resemblance … . Tom was tellin’ me there’s a couple and a brother-in-law rented a furnished flat, and they stay indoors most of the time. Anyhow they’re strangers — -won’t do no harm to ask them a few questions.”\n\nKelleher looked at his superior inquiringly.\n\n“Yeah, that’s right — question them just because they’re strangers.” Fenton’s tone was gently sarcastic. “Then they go to the mayor and complain, and he raises hell with the police. We’ve only got about fifteen thousand strangers out here for their vacations right now — you oughta make the rounds and question them all, Tim.”\n\nJimmy was reading the circular with bright black eyes. “Tough babies! They think it’s the same two shot a cop in Des Moines, stole a car in Hartford, and knocked off the owner of a gasoline station in Stamford.”\n\n“When they get the killin’ habit …” Fenton shook his head.\n\nKelleher rose, a grizzled giant of a man. “Come on, Jimmy, let’s get started. We’ll step at 441 Wyona Street first. Shaw said the name was Slade. If we’re wrong we’ll give ‘em a key to the city.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nAll Crooks Are Yellow\n\nThe apartment house was located in the middle of the block. Jimmy parked the car in front of it.\n\n“What floor, Tim, do you know?”\n\n“I think Shaw said third floor front.”\n\n“Guess I’ll go up with you.” Jimmy’s voice was casual, and he paid no attention to his brother-in-law’s contemptuous sniff. According to Kelleher, all crooks were yellow.\n\nThe street was quiet. A wind from the hills rustled the trees; the sky was clear, except for a few gray clouds as thin as wafers. As he got out of the car, Jimmy glanced upward. He thought he saw a form at one of the windows on the third floor, but when he looked again, there was no one there.\n\nThe two officers went up in the self-service elevator and walked to the door marked “30.” Kelleher touched the buzzer.\n\nA high, sing-song voice demanded, “Who’s there?”\n\n“Police checking up on licenses,” called Kelleher, using an old gag whose vagueness usually made it effective.\n\nDuring a moment of tense silence they waited for the door to open. As time passed, Kelleher glanced at Mersereau with pursed lips and raised eyebrows. Then he pressed the buzzer, once more — harder.\n\nWithout warning, a heavy slug tore through the thin wood and crashed into the wall behind Jimmy’s head. Before the police officers could move, a second shot followed. It struck Kelleher and hurled him backward. He folded, slid to the floor in a sitting posture.\n\nShooting low and from different angles, Jimmy poured six shots through the door. Reloading, he stepped, to Kelleher’s side and asked softly, “Where you hit, Tim?”\n\n“Here!” said Kelleher and swore weakly. He pointed to a spot above his right ribs. “Never mind me now — - — don’t let them get away.”\n\nMersereau pulled Kelleher to one side. Voices had begun shouting questions, and there was the sound of feet in the hallways and on the stairs.\n\nThe lieutenant turned the knob and put his weight against the door. It remained closed. He braced his back against the wall and leveled a tremendous kick. The door crashed open.\n\nAs he stepped warily forward, Jimmy became aware that Tom Shaw was hurrying toward them from the head of the stairs. He waved the superintendent back, but Shawls eyes were on his friend Kelleher.\n\nShaw called, “What’s the matter, Tim? You hurt?”\n\n“Telephone police headquarters!” snapped Mersereau. “Get an ambulance out here quick! I’m going in!”\n\nOne swift stride brought him into the apartment, gun ready. He glanced around alertly, and saw a trail of what looked like blood leading toward a bedroom. He followed it, cat-like.\n\nOn the bed lay a still form. Two bullets in him, one through his throat. The bedclothes were a red mess.\n\nSwiftly Jimmy ran through the other rooms. In the living-room he found a frightened, half-dressed girl, crouched close to the window as though tempted to jump out. She was shaking so hard he had to hold her up.\n\n“Don’t hurt me!” she begged. “Please don’t — don’t —”\n\n“Who else was in here?” snapped Jimmy. “Where’s the other one?”\n\nWide gray eyes looked out at him from a paper-white face … a slim, scared little thing with disheveled, hemp-colored hair and a half smudge of lipstick across one cheek, she begged.\n\nMersereau shook her.\n\n“Where’s the other brother? Was he in here?”\n\n“Pete — he — down the dumbwaiter!” she gasped.\n\nJimmy ran into the kitchen. The latch on the dumbwaiter was open. Looking down the shaft he could see the box at the bottom. He ran out of the apartment.\n\nThe hallway was full of men and women. Bending over Kelleher, now lying on his back with a pillow under his head, Shaw was trying to stop the flow of blood. Shaw looked up.\n\nHe said, “The ambulance is coming!”\n\nAnother voice stated, “I called the police!”\n\n“There’s a girl in there — keep an eye on her — don’t let her get away!” ordered Mersereau crisply;\n\nHe plunged through the crowd, got into the elevator, reached the basement. He ran through it; no one was there. Suddenly Mrs. Shaw opened the door of her apartment.\n\n“He was here right after Tim went upstairs!” she called.\n\n“Who was here?” snapped the lieutenant.\n\n“The older brother — Peter Slade — ain’t that who you’re looking for?”\n\n“Where’d he go?”\n\n“He ran out into the backyard! He certainly looked wild — had a gun in his hand. What’s happened, Lieutenant? I always said — “\n\nMersereau didn’t hear what she always said. He was in the backyard, then over the fence and asking questions. No one had seen anything or anybody.\n\nWhen the police car and the ambulance arrived, Mersereau got into his automobile and covered ground. He finally found a taxi driver in whose cab the fugitive had been driven to the eastern fringe of the town.\n\n“He jumps in and tells me to get goin’ and keep goin’,” related the driver. “So I ask him what’s ms hurry? He pulls a rod! You bet I done just what he told me — wouldn’t you? He got out the block past the House of Mercy, handed me a buck and told me to keep my mouth shut if I didn’t want something to happen to me.”\n\n“Where’d he go after he left you?” demanded Jimmy.\n\n“After he turned the corner from the hospital, I seen a car shoot down the road going east — it was a black sedan, going too fast for me to see the number. But I’m pretty sure he was in it — he musta had that car hidden somewhere near there.”\n\nWhen Mersereau got back to the apartment, Kelleher had been taken to the hospital, and the body of the younger Carson had been removed. One of the ofiicers had found a wallet containing four thousand dollars in a locked drawer of the dresser in the bedroom. Evidently Pete hadn’t had time to find the key and get it.\n\nRemembering that only a short time ago the brothers had robbed a victim in Frisco of twelve thousand dollars, Mersereau was not satisfied. He made a further search — in vain. Then he thought of the girl, still waiting in the other room. He went to her.\n\n“Where’s the rest of the money?” he asked curtly. -\n\nShe seemed too scared to talk, but she led him to the closet in the living-room. There, under a loose board in the floor, he found five thousand dollars in an oilskin wrapper.\n\nWhen he reported to Chief Fenton, he turned over the entire amount, nine thousand dollars. But no one else knew of the second find, and when the story appeared in the papers, only the wallet containing the four thousand dollars was mentioned.\n\n“That five grand may keep Peter Carson 1n the neighborhood, hoping he’ll get a chance to sneak in and cop it,” was Jimmy’s idea, and Fenton agreed with him.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nSnow White In Disguise\n\nWhen he entered her cell, Mersereau found the girl incongruously dressed in a cocoa silk jersey hostess gown. She was reading a newspaper one of the matrons had brought her. It was two days after the shooting, a coroner’s inquest had taken place, and a judge had acceded to the district attorney’s request that the girl he held pending the outcome of Kelleher’s wound. The name she had given was Myra Dolliver.\n\n“Well,” said Mersereau, “you’re lucky, Myra — the inspector is going to get well.”\n\n“I’m glad!” She looked as though she meant it.\n\n“So you won’t be tried as an accessory to his murder. But there’s the killing of that policeman in Des Moines — and the owner of the gas station in Stamford. You’d better help us find Pete — if you want a break.”\n\nHer fingers gripped the newspaper convulsively.\n\n“I don’t know where he is — really I don’t! Even if I knew, I’d be afraid to tell … . I’m afraid of Pete. He’d kill anybody who crossed him.”\n\nHer eyes became fixed.\n\n“He’s crazy, Pete is — nobody knows it except me — Marty knew and he was afraid of him, too. You can never tell what Pete’ll do — never!”\n\n“Crazy, is he?” As he sat down next to her on the cot, she moved as far away from him as she could. She looked very young.\n\n“I’m not the kind of girl you think I am — I’m not a gun-moll like the district attorney called me. I’d have left Pete long ago — but I was afraid. He was so queer — crazy!” She repeated, “I’m not a gun-moll!”\n\n“No, you’re Snow White in disguise,” Mersereau said cynically.\n\n“I didn’t know they were so bad,” she protested. “I didn’t know they killed that man in San Francisco. Pete asked me to go with them … he said he was going to marry me. He wasn’t so queer then — he got that way after he killed the policeman in Iowa. I used to like him in Frisco — - he took me to movies and nice restaurants. ,’ . .”\n\n“How old are you?” Mersereau’s tone was sharp.\n\n“Seventeen.”\n\n“Does Pete know anybody in town?”\n\n“No, nobody! He made us keep to ourselves.”\n\n“Where’d he be likely to go~if he left town?”\n\nShe said with conviction in her voice, “Oh, Pete wouldn’t run away without me … he loves me and he’s too crazy to be afraid of anybody … and besides he didn’t have much money on him.”\n\nThere wasn’t much more he could ask her … she’d been grilled several times during the past two days. As he sat studying her, her face broke into an ingratiating smile. She asked in a low voice, “Have you got a girl?”\n\nMersereau said, “No, only a headache — and I don’t want another.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nPete Calls Fenton\n\nChief Fenton was gloomy and exasperated. “He’s as wise as we are, the rat — if he’s still around. I’ve kept two men in the apartment on Wyona Street … not a sign of him, not even a peep.”\n\n“The girl says he’s crazy!” Mersereau remarked. “You never can tell what he’s likely to do.”\n\n“Crazy as a fox!” Fenton growled.\n\nThe telephone rang and Fenton picked it up. “Chief Fenton Speaking!”\n\nA high voice snarled, “Whyn’t you let that kid alone? She ain’t got no more to do with it than Mary’s aunt!”\n\n“Who is this?” Fenton was startled.\n\n“This is Pete Slade, that’s who this is. Now get this, Big Shot: If you know what’s good for you — and for your wife and two kids — you turn my girl loose! I’m givin’ you until Sunday — that’s six days.”\n\nFenton glanced at Mersereau, and, his lips formed the words, “Pete Slade!”\n\nThe lieutenant got busy on another wire.\n\n“So this is Pete Slade!” Fenton’s tone was jocular, even though his face was congested with rage. “Pete Carson you mean, don’t you? How about coming up here for a talk, Pete? Maybe I’ll turn Myra loose if you do.”\n\nThe high voice was queer and deadly.\n\n“Foxy guy, ain’tcha? Think you’ll keep me on this phone until some of your dumb dicks get here. Listen, Wise Guy: You live at 32 Fourth Street, right? .I just got through talkin’ to your wife over the telephone. You ask her what I said — - and I mean it! You kin put fifty cops around your house — I’ll get her, I’ll get one, of those kids — yes and I’ll get you, too. I’m declarin’ war, see! You got till Sunday to turn my girl loose!”\n\nFenton barked, as the wire became silent, “Did you get it, Jimmy?”\n\n“No. Is he gone? He was on a dial phone. What’d he say?”\n\n“Threatened my wife and kids,” said the chief slowly. “Knows where I live, too. Gave me until next Sunday to turn his girl loose.”\n\nMersereau whistled. “His girl said he was nutty! You’d better take precautions, Chief.”\n\n“Yeah, take precautions!” Fenton’s tone was bitter. “The kids’ll have to stay home from school — and that’s bad enough. I can’t help thinking what a desperate maniac like this one can do, even if I do put a guard around the house. A crazy killer loose! Maybe I can protect my own family, but how about all the other families in town … he might get a notion … he said he was declaring war. We’ve got to find him!”\n\n“And before Sunday!” Mersereau’s tone was grim.\n\nThey fine-combed and dragnetted the town from end to end, length and breadth, cellars to roofs, without finding a sign of Pete. Monday and Tues~ day passed, and each day Chief Fenton seemed to age ten years. Three policemen had been assigned to guard his house, night and day; his children and his wife stayed closely at home. And yet . . .\n\n“If I ever meet him,’ growled Fenton, “he’ll have bad luck!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThat Fool Rookie\n\nSomeone did have bad luck but it wasn’t Pete Carson, it was a rookie policeman named “Chick” Haggerty.\n\nMersereau was upstairs in Apartment 30 of the Wyona Street building, having relieved the two detectives stationed there during the day in the hope that Pete Carson might come calling for the five thousand dollars.\n\nSuddenly the lieutenant heard two shots in rapid succession. He ran to the window in time to see a black sedan go racing down the street. Rushing downstairs, Mersereau found Haggerty lying on the sidewalk.\n\n“Saw him sneaking down the basement,” mumbled Haggerty, “and I hollered to him. He turned around and shot me — twice.”\n\nThat was all Mersereau waited to hear. He commandeered the nearest car and started in pursuit of the black sedan. A dozen informants had seen a dozen sedans, black, green, all colors. But of Pete Carson and his black sedan Mersereau could not find a trace — even with the assistance of a score of helpers, both policemen and citizens. They searched every garage, every parking-place, spent the entire night at it — all in vain.\n\nWhen he heard of it, Fenton ripped the cigar out of his mouth and crushed it in a huge fist.\n\n“He was coming for the money — you’d have gotten him! He was walking right into the trap. That fool rookie — that half-wit! After me sending out orders not to stop anybody going into that house!”\n\nFenton looked old, haggard; his face was a mottled gray. He was worrying himself sick.\n\n“Haggerty forgot!” Mersereau explained gloomily. He added, “He’ll be laid up quite a while — one bullet just missed his right lung.”\n\n“Too bad he wasn’t killed!” growled Fenton.\n\nSaturday morning came and found Fenton pacing up and down his office in restless desperation. He said Mersereau, “We’ll have to get help — we can’t handle this alone, Jimmy. We’ll have to call in the Federal men — he committed crimes in other states, didn’t he?”\n\n“They’re on the job and have been right along!” Mersereau’s voice was frustrated, compassionate.\n\nThe telephone rang.\n\n“My wife and my kids haven’t stepped out of the house for days!” Fenton picked up the telephone. “Chief Fenton speaking!” he said mechanically. Then his eyes shot a swift glance to Mersereau. The lieutenant got busy instantly at another phone.\n\nPete’s high, jeering voice assailed the chief’s ear.\n\n“The Big Shot himself, hey? How’s the cop I plugged? Dead, I hope.”\n\nFenton’s self-control was admirable. He said soothingly, “Now, now, Pete, that wasn’t a policeman you shot, that was just a rookie beginner. What did you have against him, Pete? Tell you what: I’ll meet you anywhere you say — alone — and you —”\n\nThe high voice broke in violently:\n\n“What kind of a dope do you take, me for? Say, how many cops you got hanging around your house? It won’t do you no good, see! If I don’t get one of your family, I’ll get’somebody else in town — and I’ll keep killing until you turn Myra loose. Get me? That’s what I’ll do! You turn her loose — and give her that money you stole from me, too. You better, that’s all I’m tellin’ you!”\n\n“Why you rat!” Fenton gripped the phone as though he would crush it. “If you had the guts to meet me I’d bring you in by one of those long ears of yours — - and lay you alongside your brother.”\n\nHe looked urgently toward Mersereau; the lieutenant was trying desperately to locate the call. On the wire there was a moment of pregnant silence. The voice that broke it was half-choked with maniacal rage.\n\n“Long ears, hey! Make your will, Big Shot! I’ll get you! I’ll get your kids! I’ll get your woman! I’ll show you! And quit wastin’ time tryin’ to find me! Watchin’ you and your dumb cops searchin’ all over town made me laugh so hard I near swallowed my false teeth. Try kickin’ snow off the moon — it’s easier! I’m gettin’ busy on Monday!”\n\nWhen Fenton hung up, he was green under the eyes and actually shaking. “Where was he ‘phoning from, Jimmy? Did you find out?”\n\n“Crandall’s drug store. Taylor and two men are on the way. I’m going, too!”\n\nHe came back two hours later, gloomy and baffled. “Nobody remembers seeing him. It’s a busy corner. ..I suppose that’s why he picked it.” .\n\n“Maybe he’s crazy,” muttered Fenton, “but he’s foxy enough to fool us all.” He sounded tired and discouraged. Days and nights he had spent searching, working harder than any of his men.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nPete’s Letter\n\nLate in the afternoon came a letter addressed to “Myra Delhver, Police Headquarters,” written carefully in a schoolboy hand. It contained a five-dollar bill. The letter read:\n\n“Hello, kid, dont lose yore nerv I got the cops stymied. I know they will read this letter what the hell do I care. Before I get thrugh they will be only too glad to let you go. They got nothing on you beecus you did nothing this letter proves it. Im the one to blame, me and poor Marty. So why dont they come after me , the rats. I am sending you a fin more laterif you need it. I hope the cops dont steal it. Be seeing you soon. Pete.”\n\nFenton was like a caged tiger. His nerves and temper were running wild.\n\n“Of all the blistering gall! That letter was mailed yesterday afternoon, right here in town.” He paused suddenly. “How about baiting a trap with the girl — put her back in the apartment and let the papers print it?”\n\nMersereau shook his head. “You couldn’t get him that -way–he isn’t dumb by any means.”\n\n“No, I suppose you couldn’t!”\n\nFenton’s fists were clenched.\n\n“If I could only lay hands on him! The murdering rat! Who knows what he’ll do next. A fine lot we are …  he’ll be coming around to take her to the movies next. ..and he’ll get away with it, too!” With sudden exasperation he shouted, “What the hell are you looking at? You’ve seen that poster before, haven’t you?”\n\nJimmy was studying the California poster with the picture of the two brothers on it. He said thoughtfully, “Take it easy, Chief!”\n\nAs he was going out, Fenton said imploringly, “If you got any clue, Jimmy — tomorrow is Sunday!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nPennville Country Club\n\nThe road over which Lieutenant Jimmy Mersereau drove wound past the House of Mercy, and there it made a hairpin turn. Half a mile further it left the city and ran parallel with the shores of a lake. On the opposite side of the lake lay the sloping grounds of a summer camp for children; beyond the camp was the only public golf-course in that section. At least, although it belonged to the Pennville Country Club, the public were permitted to play it for a green fee.\n\nBehind Greylock’s towering peak the sun had begun its descent in a huge vista of glorious colors. Mersereau figured it would be light for another hour at least, a particularly important hour for those golf addicts who count that day wasted in which they do not go around eighteen holes at least once. There was an apple smell from the orchards all around, and Jimmy remembered that Tim Kelleher, still in the hospital, had often filled this very automobile with apples to bring home.\n\nNear the entrance to the golf course, he parked his car and got out. He walked through the rickety wooden gate that was part of the fence separating the golf links from the camp, and came to the caddy house. The young professional in charge was sandpapering a wooden club.\n\nMersereau said, “Hello, Clyde! Going to win the tournament?”\n\nClyde looked up with an engaging grin. “Hello, Lieutenant! No, not likely — but I’m aiming to give some of those big — timers something to worry about. Did you come for a lesson at last?”\n\n“Maybe forty years from now when I’m chewing with my gums!” Jimmy took out the California poster. “Have you seen this guy around?” He pointed to Pete’s likeness.\n\nClyde looked at it, shook his head. “No!”\n\n“Look again!” urged the lieutenant. “No one even resembling him?” He shook his head again. “N 0, never saw anybody like that around here. That’s the guy you’re all after, isn’t it?”\n\nMersereau nodded, bitterly disappointed.\n\n“Just the same, I’m coming over here tomorrow afternoon, when they’re all on the course. Who’s out playing now?”\n\n“Couple of ladies and a fellow named Hartman.”\n\n“Who’s he?”\n\n“Not your man — doesn’t resemble him in the slightest — just a crippled Dutchman with a sour puss and a Kaiser Wilhelm mustache. He’s been staying over at Tecum Brook with old man Hickson.”\n\nThe sandpaper squeaked nerve rackingly.\n\n“Hits some long ones off the tee, that bird! If you want to see good golf form, go and watch him.”\n\nMersereau shook his head unsmilingly.\n\n“Not interested!”\n\nThen, because he had come so far, he changed his mind.\n\n“Here, give me a bag of clubs, Clyde … I’ll waste a little time!”\n\nNear the end of the seventh fairway, he caught sight of a man hobbling along, favoring his left leg. Must be Hartman, thought Mersereau. He strolled across and climbed the squat knoll on which the eighth tee was set, and sat on the bench while Hartman holed out on a long putt. After that, Hartman came limping toward the eighth tee.\n\n“Hello!” greeted the lieutenant ‘affably. “How’s it going?”\n\nFrom behind gold-rimmed spectacles, light blue eyes appraised Jimmy without cordiality. The reply was a grunt.\n\n“Mind if I go ‘round a couple of holes with you?” Mersereau asked.\n\nHartman growled ungraciously, “If you want!”\n\nHe certainly did not look like the picture of Peter Carson. Limping over to the tee, he adjusted his ball, and bent a closely-cropped, bulletshaped head as he prepared to drive off. And yet … well, perhaps it was the line of the jaw or the high cheekbones … or, perhaps, thought Jimmy, I’m just imagining things.\n\nHartman’s left leg seemed shorter than his right. As he drove, he bent his right knee. Down the center of the fairway whistled the white sphere, a good two hundred yards.\n\n“Swell!” praised Mersereau, and the German’s surly features relaxed perceptibly. Even the points of his mustache wiggled with gratification.\n\n“I think so! Now see vat you can do!”\n\nThe guttural tones were not at all like the high, singsong voice which had demanded, “Who’s there?” through the door of the apartment at 441 Wyona Street. Still, that might have been Martin’s voice.\n\nMersereau had not heard Pete over the telephone.\n\nSwinging his club, Mersereau stepped to the tee.\n\n“I’m not much good at this,” he apologized. He wiggled his stick as he had seen other golfers do. Out of the corner of his eye he glanced toward Hartman, who was watching him intently. The German frowned and remained silent.\n\nJimmy swung mightily. His driver topped the ball, and he followed through … followed through so completely that the head of the club came whistling straight for Hartman’s head.\n\nHartman cried, “Hey!” and sprang back. The club missed him by about an inch. Rigidly erect, he stood and glared at Jimmy.\n\n“You damn fool, you near brained me!” he growled.\n\n“Sorry!” apologized Mersereau easily. “I told you I’m a punk golfer.”\n\nHe brought out a package of cigarettes and offered one to Hartman, who brusquely refused. Mersereau lit one for himself, took a couple of puffs and threw it away. His glance rested on Hartman’s legs, both now quite straight and even.\n\nAt once the German’s right knee bent.\n\n“I go play by myself!” he said curtly. He picked up his bag and slung it over his shoulder.\n\nMersereau called, “Wait a minute! You don’t recognize me, do you?”\n\n“You? I nefer saw you before.”\n\n“That’s right, you didn’t, come to think of it. You couldn’t see me over the telephone when you talked to Chief Fenton, could you?”\n\nHartman looked at him with bewilderment.\n\n“Vat you talking about? Crazy!”\n\nHe started limping off.\n\n“Now, now!” Jimmy’s voice was full of gentle chiding. “Don’t be in such a hurry, Pete. You should have worn green whiskers … those specs and the mustache aren’t enough. Put your hands up — high!”\n\nHis gun pointed steadily at the golfer.\n\n“I’m afraid you’re not going to finish this game — not ever. You’re coming with me.”\n\nHartman demanded “Vat is dis — a holdup?”\n\n“Sure, you hold up your knee and quit faking — it won’t do you any good. You jumped fast enough when I swung that club at you!” Jimmy was enjoying himself thoroughly, thinking of Kelleher, and Haggerty, and the men this fellow had murdered in cold blood, indignantly, hands out behind you, Pete — unless you want lead. Chief Fenton is waiting to finish those conversations you started over the telephone — you never did give him a chance to have the last word, did you?”\n\nSlowly the man slid the bag off his shoulder to the ground. He said, “How’d you guess? Listen, give me a break, will ya? It’s worth a thousand — two thousand. How about it?”\n\n“I’ll give you a break!” Mersereau’s voice was bitter, hard. “The same kind of break you gave poor Tim Kelleher, and Haggerty, and the cop in Des Moines — and a lot of others probably. Come on, rat, turn around and put your hands back of you!”\n\nPete turned about slowly. Suddenly he stumbled over his bag of clubs — fell on his stomach. He rolled over. But Jimmy was watching closely, He caught a flash of the blue forty-five as Pete pulled it from inside his shirt.\n\nA second’s hesitation and there would have been another murder for Pete to crow over. But Mersereau’s gun boomed once and again. One bullet struck Pete in the chest, one went through his face. Their force threw him over on his back. Still he clutched the gun. Jimmy stepped forward swiftly and took it away.\n\nBut life was strongly rooted in the killer. His body jerked and he clawed at the lieutenant’s face, drawing blood. Then he relaxed. His spectacles had fallen off, and his eyes were fast-glazing pits of hatred.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nNobody’d Think of Looking There\n\n“What put me on the right track,” Mersereau explained to Chief Fenton, “was that word ‘stymied’ in Pete’s letter — that and the statement in the poster that the brothers had been caddies. The Pennville course is the only one within miles that’s open”to the public, and right near town, too — he could walk it in half an hour — although he chose to use the sedan now and then. I found that sedan in the woods back of the golf-course. I was dumb not to think of it before — that a caddie would naturally gravitate toward a golf-course and nobody’d think of looking there.”\n\nFenton asked almost humbly, “If you’re dumb, what would you call the rest of us?” He added with a grin: “That girl Myra’s been knitting you a sweater — she wants to be your girl.”\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Gip\n  Tillson Refuses\n  The Ring\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nGip\n\nIt was preposterous, of course, but Maxim Verdette imagined that a dead man’s soul was staring out at him through the eyes of the dog.\n\n“Gip!” he called, remembering the terrier’s name.\n\nA shaggy bundle of white and tan stirred on the rug before the fireplace, trundled forward a few steps, then stopped and peered warily at its master.\n\nVerdette tossed aside the newspaper he had been reading. He had never liked dogs, and the dislike had been mutual. He had acquired Gip along with the rest of his brother’s possessions, and he recalled there was a ridiculous paragraph in the will expressing a wish that the animal be well cared for.\n\nNow, as master and beast gazed into each other’s eyes, Maxim Verdette determined that the dog should die. He could not imagine what his brother Justin, a flinty, crafty man whose lodestar throughout life had been the dollar sign, had seen to like in a worthless cur like that. He knew that even the hardest of men have their streaks of sentimental weakness, but he had never suspected such a streak in Justin.\n\nYes, he reflected, conscious of a growing antipathy to the terrier, Gip must die. There must be no irritations to mar his enjoyment of the life of wealth, ease and luxury he had only that day begun. Though he could not analyze his feelings, the dog vexed him in a strange way. There was not only Maxim’s absurd fancy that his dead brother was looking at him through the beast’s eyes, but also something subtler, more trenchant, something that inspired him with odd qualms.\n\n“Gip, old boy, come here,” he said in a wheedling tone; but the terrier must have sensed the falsetto in his voice, for he stopped again after a few reluctant steps forward, his intelligent eyes full of suspicion as, with head bent to one side, he peered at his master with an intensity that was almost human.\n\nVerdette, now getting a closer view of the animal, laughed. As he had suspected, his imagination had tricked him. Gip’s eyes in no way resembled the dead man’s. Justin’s had been a sort of ratlike gray, while the predominant tone in the terrier’s was a calm, deep brown. Justin’s eyes had been narrow, elongated slits, while Gip’s were wide and almost round. No resemblance whatever, Maxim assured himself; just a foolish fancy of his, probably the result of his mental restlessness the past year.\n\nHe reached for the newspaper, but a new and startling impression stayed his hand. It suddenly struck him there was something familiar in the terrier’s squinting scrutiny, in the slant of the small, alert head, and, above all, in the odd trick of holding one leg in front of the other. It was a most uncommon way for a dog to stand; there was an uncanny suggestion in it of something human. And suddenly Verdette remembered that his brother, Justin, had been wont to stand just like that.\n\nIt had been one of Justin’s favorite poses. He had always struck it when “sizing up his man” as he used to say. Verdette remembered it well — the head tilted slightly to the left, the legs crossed, the sharp, cynical eyes bent on a scrutiny that seemed to search the inmost niches of the soul. He had often shrank from that steady, sardonic and almost painful inspection, hiding his embarrassment behind a laugh and a jest.\n\nNow, in the quiet of the softly illumined and richly furnished library, the terrier’s aping of the dead man’s mannerisms seemed almost weird. Verdette understood now why the dog’s eyes had impressed him so strangely. He had recognized Justin’s pose, and his fancy had conjured up a dead man’s soul behind it. He laughed again, but the laugh had a shrill note. Perceiving that his hands were trembling, he crossed the floor and poured a stiff drink. Then, again resolving that the dog must die, he sat down and picked up the newspaper.\n\nHis eyes chanced on an item chronicling that Maxim Verdette had that day returned from an extensive tour of South America and had taken up his residence in his brother’s house on Fifth Avenue. The article alluded to what had become known as “The Verdette Mystery,” recalling that in the year that had now elapsed since Justin Verdette’s disappearance, nothing had been definitely established in regard to his fate. It was the general opinion that he had been murdered and that the murderer had disposed of the body. A crimson stain on the bedroom floor, discovered by a servant the morning following Justin’s disappearance, gave weight to that theory. But who had committed the deed, what had been the motive, and what had become of the body?\n\nA thin smile parted Maxim’s lips as he read on. It was stated that the police, as well as the private detectives engaged by the dead man’s brother, had practically given up hope of solving the mystery. It was recalled that Maxim Verdette, being his brother’s sole heir, and apparently the only person to whom a tangible motive could be ascribed, had been closely questioned by the police during the initial stages of the investigation, but had established a satisfactory alibi. Besides, if Maxim had killed the brother with a view to hastening the day of his inheritance, it was unthinkable that he should have disposed of the body, since he must have been well aware that the courts would insist on satisfactory proof of Justin’s death before they released the estate.\n\nMaxim’s smile broadened. He had hoped that some bright mind would hit upon just such an argument. It was, indeed, unthinkable that an impatient beneficiary should conceal the only proof that existed of his benefactor’s death, thereby tying up the estate in interminable court proceedings. It had been a very effective touch, that, and almost as brilliantly conceived as the convincing, but neither too perfect nor too obvious, alibi.\n\nAnd Maxim Verdette had the patience to wait. Already his attorney had obtained for him permission to occupy his dead brother’s magnificent house and to use a generous percentage of the income from the estate for living expenses. Eventually all legal requirements would have been complied with, and the courts would declare Justin presumptively dead. And if that day were too long in coming, there was always the possibility that the body would — by merest accident, of course — he found by somebody; perhaps by Maxim Verdette himself.\n\nThe newspaper slipped from his fingers. He leaned back in the chair, and a glow of complete gratification spread over his sleek and somewhat crafty features. The future lay radiant before his vision, a pleasing prospect of velvety ease, dazzling lights, superb revels, splendid adventures. He had always had a craving for pleasure; now he had the money with which to indulge it. It was an excellent combination. Maxim Verdette, once the black sheep of the family and now its only surviving member, felt that he had just begun to live.\n\nThen, abruptly, the tantalizing vision faded. All the life died out of the smile on Maxim’s face, leaving only a dead, frozen smirk. His roving eyes had paused on the dog, who had crawled back to its rug before the fireplace; and again he thought that some subtly terrifying emanation of the dead man was staring at him through the eyes of the beast. Something in the steady, relentless scrutiny of those eyes gave him a chill. Then he laughed hoarsely.\n\nThe dog was lying on its side, pressing its right forepaw against the black-speckled tip of its head. It was a quaint trick and would have impressed Maxim as ludicrous if he had not seen in it another of the dead brother’s mannerisms. It had been characteristic of Justin to press his right hand against his chin when absorbed in the thought; and now the terrier was mimicking, so far as his anatomy permitted, this peculiarity of the dead man. It was a droll conceit, but to Maxim it seemed a ghostly gesture, an absurd but harrowing suggestion that some fragment of the harsh, cold and eccentric nature of Justin Verdette had become incarnate in the dog.\n\nIn that moment his dislike of the small creature turned to hate. The beast seemed to be deliberately taunting him. It seemed to take a diabolical delight in parading before his eyes a personality that belonged in the region of shades and phantoms. He felt a strong impulse to beat it to death, knowing that its agonized yelps would compensate him for the torture he was now enduring. A cruel grin on his lips, he arose and stepped toward the fireplace.\n\nA low growl stopped him, and the next instant he knew he was beaten. It was neither fear nor pity that checked him, but awe of the thing that stared out of the terrier’s eyes. He cursed himself for his asininity and indecision, but to no avail. He felt — it was a childish fancy, of course, but he could not resist it — that in laying hands on the dog he should also be laying hands on something spectral, unearthly.\n\nHe turned away with a hollow chuckle and flung another drink down his throat. For a moment the liquor stiffened his resistance to the weird influence exerted by the dog. He wanted to laugh, but the laughter choked in his throat. He had heard of such things as qualms of conscience, and he supposed that if he ever were to feel them, he would feel them during his first night under the dead man’s roof.\n\nHe was a bit nervous, he told himself, and his fevered imagination made him see things. That was all. He had merely imagined that the cur was aping Justin’s mannerisms, and this in turn had caused him to see a dead man’s soul in the animal’s eyes. Nothing to get excited over. It was the height of idiocy for him to be cowed by a helpless mite of a dog. Ha! ha! The dog must die. It would be just as well, though, to let some one else attend to the execution. He jabbed at a bell.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nTillson Refuses\n\n“Did you ring, sir?” The butler’s tune was funereal — and quite in tune with Maxim’s mental state.\n\n“Did I ring?” he said angrily. “You know very well I rang! If not, why did you stick your ugly mug in here?”\n\nThe butler regarded him stonily, his face as blank as an unwritten page. It was Maxim’s first close look at the man, and he felt the same instinctive suspicion he had felt toward Gip. There was a quality in the man’s stiff bearing and impassive face that puzzled him.\n\n“Your name is — ?”\n\n“Tillson, sir.”\n\nThough he could not explain why, Maxim felt there was a mystery behind the unfathomable face, that might be worth plumbing. “You worked for my brother a good many years, eh, Tillson?”\n\n“Fourteen, sir.”\n\n“I understand he was a hard master?”\n\nA part of the man’s iciness seemed to melt away. His voice shook a little. “He was, and he wasn’t, sir. At times he treated me very harshly. But once, when I was in troubles he acted like a friend — and a good one — to me.”\n\nMaxim scowled. Another of Justin’s sentimental weaknesses, he thought; and suddenly he sensed an insidious danger in the butler’s apparent devotion to the dead man.\n\n“Well, there’s one thing I want you to understand, Tillson,” he said sternly. “The relations between you and me will be strictly those of master and servant. Get me?”\n\n“I understand, sir.” Tillson stood stiffly erect, his inscrutable eyes leveled straight at the master’s face. Maxim felt something of the same inward quavering he had experienced before the dog’s scrutiny. There was not a quiver in Tillson’s face, and he seemed as rigid and impassive as though he had been a mummy, but his mere presence in the room electrified the atmosphere.\n\n“Why the devil do you look at me like that?” asked Maxim.\n\n“I meant no offense, sir,” said Tillson, evenly.\n\nMaxim restrained an impulse to throw him out bodily.\n\n“Tell you what I want you to do,” he said thickly. “I want you to take that dog out of here and kill him.”\n\nThe stony look fled from the butler’s face. “Kill Gip? I couldn’t do that, sir. Your brother thought the world and all of him. He often used to say —”\n\n“I don’t give a hang what he used to say!” exclaimed Maxim. “I want that infernal cur killed, and I want him killed now.”\n\nTillson gazed tenderly at the terrier, and the animal gazed back with mute gratitude in its eyes. It seemed to Maxim as though it had instinctively caught the drift of the conversation, and it infuriated him to think that an understanding existed between the dog and the butler. A stream of angry invective was on his lips.\n\nHe started as a clock began to strike the hour of eleven. He had an odd feeling that the tolling, subdued, distant and haunting, was a part of the scene being enacted by himself, the butler and the dog. As the first dulcet tones sounded, the terrier rose from its recumbent position and peered wistfully at the armchair beside the library table. As the last stroke died, it emitted a soft, plaintive yelp.\n\n“What’s ailing the brute?” muttered Maxim.\n\n“Mr. Justin Verdette was very punctual in his habits, as you may know, sir,” explained the butler. “He spent his evenings here reading, but on the stroke of eleven he would go to his bedroom. Gip always followed him, and he still goes through the motions, just as though he didn’t realise his master was dead. Look at him, sir.” Gip had risen on his hind legs beside the chair. Now, with long, eager strokes of the tongue, he was lapping the leather covering of the armrest, as though unaware that the chair was vacant and that there was no master’s hand to lick.\n\nMaxim, shaking with helpless rage, stood staring at the spectacle, his senses dazed by the ghostly mummery enacted before his eyes. It seemed as though everybody were conspiring to taunt him with the specter of Justin Verdette.\n\n“Come, Gip,” called Tillson, solemnly. “You see, sir, I always take him to Mr. Justin Verdette’s bedroom at night, just as your brother used to do when he was alive.”\n\nHe stepped from the room, beckoning Gip to follow. Maxim, infuriated at the fellow’s cool impudence, was about to repeat his order that the dog be killed, but the scene that now ensued rendered him speechless. The terrier started after the butler, but it did not walk as dogs usually walk, but strutting on two legs and with its front limbs crossed in crude but startling imitation of Justin Verdette’s habit of pacing the floor with arms folded.\n\nAs if magnetized against his will, Maxim followed. As they traversed room after room, he felt as though he were treading in the footsteps of the dead, and meanwhile he was silently cursing the wild fancies that were shooting through his brain. Erect and as grimly silent as though he were the master of some uncanny ceremonial, Tillson walked slowly and evenly at the head of the queer procession. Maxim felt like shouting to the fellow and calling his attention to the dog’s strange behavior; but something — he did not know what — told him that he did not wish Tillson to witness the bizarre spectacle. Perhaps he dreaded the look of understanding which, he half suspected, he would see in the butler’s face.\n\nTillson opened a door, and the dog bounded past him into the room. Maxim saw the animal gaze, with an expression that was almost tender, at the somber draperies in front of the bed. Then, with a hoarse, long-drawn moan and head hanging low, it slunk into a corner and lay down.\n\nSilent and stony-faced, Tillson watched the dog for a few moments; and again Maxim was impressed with something mystic and baffling in the man’s features. Then, without a word, but with a look that sent a shiver through Maxim’s being, he turned on his heels and left the room.\n\nThe bedchamber seemed very quiet and dismal. Maxim found the air heavy and choking. The rain was drumming lazily against the windows, and the wind swept past with a dirge-like drone. There seemed to be whispers — strange, muffled voices — about him. He looked at the dog, wondering whether its eyes still mirrored the dead man’s soul. Then, urged on by an odd fascination, he stepped toward where the terrier lay curled up on its rug. The light was dim there, and he could see only a shaggy outline and a few dull streaks of tan and white.\n\nThe dog gave a warning growl as he stooped for a closer look, and he saw that its paws were toying with something — something that struck an opaline shimmer into the gloom. A curious tingle ran down his spine as he snatched at the object. The dog, with another and louder growl, snapped fiercely at his fingers. He felt a choke in his throat as he drew back and considered ways and means of separating the animal from its treasure. His mind swam, and his only clear thought was that he must, somehow, see what the thing was.\n\nOn a taboret near the bed stood a heavy silver match safe. Maxim snatched it up, dealt the terrier a stunning blow on the head, and with a feeble moan it crumpled into a limp heap. The next moment the lustrous object was in Maxim’s hand. His fingers trembled as he held it to the light.\n\nThen an icy sensation shuddered through his veins. A dull cry sprang from his bloodless lips as his wild eyes stared at the object.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Ring\n\nIt was a ring of rare and curious workmanship, the heavy gold band being fashioned into a likeness of a coiled serpent, lavishly studded with brilliants. Its glitter had fascinated Maxim’s eyes more than once, and he had been told there was none other like it in the world. It had been made expressly for an East Indian banker, who had presented it to an American friend. A year had passed since Maxim last saw it — and at that time it had adorned one of Justin Verdette’s fingers.\n\nThat was why his face took on a strained, ashen look of anguish while the electric light broke into riotous iridescence against the blazing jewel. His mind reeled as he sought an explanation of its presence in the house. According to all the laws of fact and reason, the ring should lie under several feet of dirt, beside the decaying bones of Justin Verdette. It had been buried there, Maxim knew.\n\nPrompted by greed, he had tried hard, that night a year ago, to wrench the ring from his brother’s stiffening fingers. It had fitted tightly, and he had failed. Afterward, in a saner moment, he had been glad of it, for so unique an ornament must inevitably have betrayed him if he had attempted to sell it. Besides, he had reasoned, in the event that the courts should demand absolute proof of Justin Verdette’s death, it might be desirable to arrange an “accidental” discovery of the bones, and then the ring would serve as identification.\n\nWith sickening anguish he realized that the presence of the ring in the house meant that the grave had been found.\n\n“But by whom?” he wondered, wiping the cold, prickly sweat from his face. Everything depended upon that. Had it been found by some one who had searched for it with a view to bringing the murderer of Justin Verdette to justice? Had that cur —\n\nHe glared savagely at the corner where Gip lay. The dog’s eyes were glassy and half closed, but he fancied that a glint of humanness was blazing out at him through those rigid orifices. The fact that the ring had been in Gip’s possession, viewed in connection with the butler’s mysterious demeanor, was distinctly disquieting. A blind, unreasoning fear, a dazed feeling that he had suddenly been transported to a goblin world where dead men’s souls stared out of the eyes of beasts, sent a numbing chill through his being.\n\nSlowly his mind began to function again, and his first clear thought was that he must know what had happened. A glance through the window told him that the town was wrapped in a dripping blanket of thick clouds. The house and the immediate neighborhood were almost oppressively silent. It was near midnight.\n\nHe thrust the ornament into a pocket and dashed from the room. Reaching his own bedchamber, he armed himself with a pistol and wriggled into a raincoat. Then he stole down the stairs and out through the rear. At the back of the garage, where he remembered such implements had always been kept, he found a short-handled spade. Concealing it beneath his raincoat, he scurried down the automobile driveway, darted across the street, and faded away in the black shadows that hung over the park.\n\nHe recalled, with a nervous chill, that other wet and dark night when, with a limp burden dangling from his shoulders, he had taken the same route. As this time, he had crossed the street unseen, and in the black depths of the park he was safe from spying eyes. Yet, as he hastened forward, a mere blot against the thick gloom, he fancied that the lambent glow of the terrier’s eyes was zigzagging through the darkness.\n\nHe muttered an oath. A moment later he stopped at a rectangular intersection. He could scarcely see the dim ribbons of road, but the topography of the region was indelibly graven on his mind. He stumbled forward until he came to a huge bowlder that rose, frowning and shadowy, before his eyes. He walked halfway around it, then stopped and went down on his knees.\n\nHe remembered the place vividly. He felt with his fingers until he found the exact spot where, by digging in a slanting direction, he should soon prove the correctness or absurdity of the suspicion suggested to his mind by the serpentine ornament. He thrust the point of the spade into the ground.\n\nThen an amazed gasp slipped from his lips. The ground was firm, belying his suspicion that any one had disturbed it since he himself had dug there a year ago. Yet he had seen, only a few minutes ago, the very ring which had been buried there with the body of Justin Verdette.\n\nShaking, he struggled to his feet; and suddenly a tall, shadowy figure darted out of the silence and the gloom. With arms folded, he stood there erect, accusing, and he felt its burning eyes boring into his face. With a hoarse exclamation, he darted aside, but the specter followed.\n\n“Who — who are you?” he gasped.\n\n“Tillson,” said a deep, funereal voice. “Much obliged to you for leading me to the place where you buried it. I loved your brother, and I swore I’d find the fiend that murdered him.”\n\nThree other shadows detached themselves from the darkness and joined Tillson. Maxim, an overwhelming weakness stealing over him, managed to splutter a question.\n\n“Oh, the jewel,” said Tillson. “That was only a fairly good imitation, made from my description of the original.”\n\nMaxim stumbled away between two of his captors. He heard Tillson’s voice.\n\n“The little cuss was coming to when I left. The blow stunned him for a while. Say, that’s some dog! Mr. Justin Verdette used to amuse himself by teaching it to imitate some of his manners, and the little fellow still keeps it up. Some dog, eh?”\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "Barbara lay on her side, facing me, beautiful with the relaxed softness of sleep. My wife was thirty-two, but in sleep she looked no more than twenty. I studied her face a moment, and then, knowing how little it took to wake her, I got out of bed carefully and walked on bare feet to the bathroom. She was still asleep when I finished dressing and left for the station house.\n\nIn the squad room, I lifted a container of coffee from Joe Hayes’ desk, and drank half of it.\n\n“Don’t drink it all, Walt,” he said.\n\n“I’m tired of waiting,” I said.\n\n“You talking about Liddie White again?”\n\n“That’s right.”\n\nHe frowned.\n\n“Don’t get any crazy ideas, Walt. The lieutenant won’t like it.”\n\n“To hell with him.”\n\n“Why don’t you wait a couple of days? Hell, Tim Casey is one of the best men on the force. Liddie wouldn’t be getting dope without his seeing it.”\n\n“She’s getting it somewhere,” I said.\n\n“Maybe she’d stocked up on the stuff. You ever figure that?”\n\n“Sure, I figured it. And I’m still tired of waiting.” I handed the coffee back to him. “I’m going over there.”\n\nTim Casey was on his way toward my car even before I’d cut the motor. He saluted, grinning at me. “Hello, Sergeant.”\n\n“Hello, Tim. Any action?”\n\n“Not a damn bit. She hasn’t been out at all.”\n\n“Okay. Well, as long as I’m here, we might as well make the most of it. Why don’t you go down the street and have some breakfast? I’ll spell you a while.”\n\n“Thai’s a hell of a good idea. Sergeant. I’ll make it fast.” He turned and walked off toward the diner at the corner.\n\nI left the car and headed for the brownstone where Liddie White lived. The building was near the middle of the block, flanked by a cut-rate drugstore and a grimy-windowed bar. I climbed three flights of sagging stairs, walked along a dark corridor, and knocked on Liddie’s door.\n\nThe door opened a little, showing one gray eye and part of an unnaturally white face. The eye narrowed, and Liddie started to close the door. I got my foot in it.\n\n“Open up, Liddie,” I said.\n\n“What the hell do you want?”\n\nI pulled the door all the way open and stepped inside. Liddie slammed it shut behind me, and then leaned against it, staring at me.\n\n“What the hell do you want?” she said again. She was a very pretty woman, Liddie was, even when her gray eyes were angry and the uncombed auburn hair splayed loosely across her back and shoulders. Her body, beneath the thin material of her housecoat, was lush, and she had the smallest waist I’d ever seen.\n\n“Don’t you go out any more, Liddie?” I asked.\n\n“Look, copper. I’ve been a real good girl. You got no right to come barging in here like this.”\n\n“I didn’t barge in,” I said. “You invited me in. You insisted on it. Remember?”\n\n“You’re just like all the others. You haven’t even got a warrant.”\n\nI muled at her.\n\n“That’s right. Liddie. No warrant. You could probably get me in a lot of trouble.”\n\nShe glared at me.\n\n“Damn you. You know I can’t get anybody in trouble.”\n\nI nodded. “Just so we understand each other, Liddie.”\n\n“If you’re looking for Horse, you’re wasting your time. There isn’t any here.”\n\n“It’s here,” I said. “It has to be. We’ve had a tail on you for almost two weeks. You haven’t made a buy in all that time. And with a big habit like yours, Liddie, that means you’ve got a supply right here.”\n\n“Since when arc cops interested in users? What’ll it get you to hang a beef on me? You think the commissioner will give you a gold star?”\n\n“I’m not interested in you, Liddie. I want your pusher.”\n\n“You crazy? You think I’d cut off my supply?”\n\n“You can always get another. Who’s the guy, Liddie?”\n\nShe took a slow step toward me, and there was fear in her eyes now. “Give me a break, for God’s sake.”\n\n“I’m giving you one. I know you’ve got heroin here. I’m not even going to look for it. All I want is the name of your pusher, and an idea of where to find him.”\n\nShe bit at her lower lip a moment. “What’ll I do when the pile’s gone?”\n\n“You’ll find another pusher. You junkies always do.” I paused. “This is the last time around, Liddie. Tell me who and where.”\n\nShe told me who and where.\n\nI let myself in with one of my skeleton keys. There was no one home. I went through the pusher’s apartment until I found the stuff. I’d expected more, but there were only seven packets of it. I stuffed them into my pocket, darkened the room, and sat down in an easy chair to wait.\n\nAn hour crawled by, and then another, and finally the door opened. I got up silently, slid my hand down into my trenchcoat pocket, and worked my fingers around the butt of my short-barreled .38. The guy was fumbling for the light switch, a very tall guy with outsize shoulders.\n\nWhen the light came on, I said, “Easy, Carter. Keep your hands in sight.”\n\nHe closed the door slowly, and if there was any expression at all on his face, it was only a very mild surprise.\n\n“You a cop?” he asked.\n\n“That’s right. Come over here.”\n\nHe stayed where he was. “You been here long?”\n\n“Long enough to find the stuff.”\n\n“Yeah. Well, that’s not so good, is it?” His right hand came up to one of the buttons on his coat and he began to toy with it.\n\n“I told you to come over here,” I said.\n\n“Can we make a deal?” he asked. “I’ll make it pretty good.”\n\n“No deal,” I said.\n\nHe nodded slowly, as if thinking it over, and then suddenly his hand was inside his coat.\n\nI could have shot him then, but I didn’t want to ruin a good trench coat. I jerked the .38 out and shot him twice, once in the stomach and once in the face.\n\nWhen I got home, the first thing I noticed was the ash tray. It was loaded with butts. I closed the door and took off my coat.\n\nBarbara came in from the kitchen. I tried not to look at her face. I knew what I’d see there.\n\n“Any luck?” she asked. “I — I’ve been going crazy, Walt.”\n\n“In my trench coat pocket,” I said.\n\nShe grabbed up my coat and shoved her hand into one of the pockets.\n\nShe was so jittery she dropped the coat. She picked it up and clawed through the other pocket, whimpering a little. I had to look away from her.\n\n“Is this all?” she asked. “Just two?”\n\n“There were only seven packets to begin with,” I told her. “I had to take five of them to the station house, to book as evidence.”\n\n“You turned over five of them? Why? Damn you, Walt!”\n\n“There’s a man dead because of this,” I said. “I had to make it look good.”\n\nBut she wasn’t even listening. She was too busy tearing open one of the packets of heroin.\n\nTHE END\n"

What I say is — just lemme win one o’ them fifty-thous’nd-pound prizes, an’ you can curse me till you’re blue in the face.”\n\nThe young man grinned, and grunted his approval of this sentiment. The woman, however, standing three or four yards away, paid no attention to the men, but continued to stare across the line at the opposite wall.\n\nThen, conceiving a sudden affection for the young man, the tipsy fellow produced a visiting card from his waistcoat pocket, and thrust it upon him.\n\n“That’s me,” he said, “John Blake’s the name. Mecca Traction Comp’ny. Any time you wanna buy a shteam roller, jus’ remember. I’m your man.”\n\nMr. Blake had by this time moved over to the lady, and was now raising his hat, and asking her if she was, by any chance, one of the three sisters — Faith, Hope and Charity.\n\nHe was very properly snubbed. The lady drew her coat collar a little more closely about her face, and strolled on towards the extreme end of the platform.\n\nBlake came back mumbling.\n\nAt this juncture the train came in at the other end of the station, and John Blake and the lady got in the front carriage, which was empty.\n\nThe young man remained on the platform, his being the next train.\n\nAn instant later, the train had pulled out, and the young man had entirely dismissed the incident from his mind. He was engrossed in the paper once more, little dreaming that he would be figuring in its next issue as an important witness in a murder case.\n\nIt was a case which eclipsed the Monravian Sweepstake Curse in public interest, and everybody had been reading about that.\n\nTommy Burke was discussing the “curse” with his employer, Dixon Hawke, when Detective-Inspector Gray called at the Dover Street chambers, and the Scotland Yard man contributed his opinion.\n\n“As I see it,” he said, “this Archbishop’s denunciation of the sweepstake has just been made use of by the sensationalists to air a pet theory. I see nothing remarkable in the fact that half a dozen winners have come to grief since this so-called curse. A sudden windfall’s always liable to be bad for the man who hasn’t been used to money.”\n\n“The chap who’s just committed suicide, apparently for no reason at all, is the third to do so,” commented Hawke. “Another died from heart failure about three years ago on hearing of his good fortune.”\n\n“That was immediately after the Archbishop’s denunciation had been pronounced,” put in Tommy.\n\n“The others,” said Gray, “drank themselves to death, and I guess they just happened to be the kind who would have done that anyway.\n\n“Enough of that,” he went on briskly. “I didn’t come here to talk about the Monravian Sweepstake. I came to tell you we’ve pulled in the man who seems to have committed this underground railway murder.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Mysterious Note\n\nHawke picked up his morning paper, and glanced at a paragraph in the stop press.\n\n“Mrs. Watson,” he said, after he had read it, “of Waverley Court, Berkeley Square. Understood to be living apart from husband — h’m — fractured skull — powerful blow with some metallic object.”\n\nHe shot an inquiring glance at the inspector.\n\n“A young chap named Edward Thomas,” explained the latter, “saw that paragraph, and came along to tell us a fellow named John Blake, who had given him his card, got in the train with her at Berkeley Square, two stations before she was found murdered.\n\n“We called on John Blake,” he continued, “and found blood on his coat sleeve. He admits that he’d had too much to drink, and that he made a fool of himself by speaking to Mrs. Watson in Berkeley Square Station. His story is that he got off at Park, the next station to Berkeley Square, leaving the woman quite O.K.”\n\nGray paused to light a cigarette.\n\n“He wants you to act for him,” he said.\n\n“Then perhaps,” replied Hawke dryly, “he really is innocent of the crime. How does he explain the blood on his sleeve?”\n\n“He says that, being slightly unsteady on the feet, he stumbled on the steps when he was coming out of Park Station, and fell on his nose, causing it to bleed. Nobody was about who could bear witness to this, and he’s quite unable to prove that he did get off the train at Park.”\n\n“Well, what happened to Mrs. Watson?”\n\n“The next station after Park,” proceeded Gray, “is Chester Road, and a crowd of people were waiting for the train there. The first few who got in saw the woman sprawled on the floor. Her hat lay a few feet away, and there was blood on her forehead.”\n\nHawke was frowning thoughtfully as he packed tobacco in his pipe.\n\n“Let me see,” he said. “I believe it’s an exceptionally long run from Park to Chester Road. Isn’t there a disused station on the way?”\n\n“That’s so. Newbury Street. Been closed for some years. It’s a derelict place — all in darkness — but if you’re thinking that somebody might have broken through the boarded-up entrance and got on the train there, I’m afraid you’re barking up the wrong tree, old man. The train doesn’t stop there. Goes through at express speed, in fact.”\n\n“Really! My recollection is that the trains very often draw to a standstill along that stretch.”\n\n“Ah, but not at the old station. Some little distance before. There’s a junction just ahead, and the signals are very often against the train. It’s quite impossible for anyone to board the train in the tunnel. It fits too neatly.”\n\n“You’re depressing me,” said Hawke with a frown.\n\nThe inspector grinned, and pulled out his wallet from his breast-pocket.\n\n“There’s just one tiny outlet for your activities,” he said. “It may mean nothing, or may serve only to convict Blake, should it transpire that he knew the lady.”\n\nHe handed over a half-sheet of grubby notepaper.\n\n“This was in her handbag,” he remarked.\n\nHawke read the following message, which was scrawled in pencil:\n\n“Shall want to see you before you go, and, as you’re in such a hurry, you’d better get on to the 9.58 southbound at Berkeley Square to-night. We’ll have a talk about the money.”\n\nHawke studied the message for some moments, and when he glanced up his face reflected something of the interest it had aroused.\n\n“Is John Blake connected with the railway?” he asked, after he had read the note.\n\n“No. He sells traction engines and steam rollers.”\n\n“That’s very interesting.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nAn Interview with Blake\n\nGray scowled slightly. “What’s interesting about it?” he demanded.\n\n“It’s a bit early for anyone to start making suggestions,” answered the criminologist, rising. “We’ll go and see Mr. Blake, and hear what he has to say for himself.”\n\nTommy accompanied his employer to the cells, where they found the commercial traveller looking very sorry for himself.\n\n“I felt a bit hilarious when I was on the platform,” he said in answer to Hawke’s queries, “having just celebrated a successful deal, and I made a fool of myself. I never saw her before in my life, and I didn’t speak to her in the train. I sat at the back end of the coach, and she sat right up at the front.”\n\n“And you’re quite sure there was no one else in the coach?”\n\n“Quite positive.”\n\n“And no one got in that coach when you alighted at Park Station?”\n\n“I don’t think anyone got in the train at all. Two or three others got out — from the rear coaches.”\n\nHawke next visited the police surgeon, who told him:\n\n“There are marks round the neck of the victim, Mr. Hawke, and she has a fracture of the skull. It looks as though the murderer seized her by the throat with one hand, and dealt the death blow with the other.”\n\nThe detective and his assistant next visited the block of flats where Mrs. Watson had lived.\n\nThey were rather high-class flats, and Captain Willoughby, who occupied that next to Mrs. Watson’s, was a man of culture and some social standing.\n\n“She held parties in her flat,” he informed the detective. “My wife and I were always being invited. We only went a couple of times. Mrs. Watson struck me as a sort of social climber. Newly rich, and all that — little bit ostentatious with her money, and a shade over-careful in her speech. Never revealed anything of her past history.”\n\n“How long had she been here?”\n\n“About eleven months. There was a husband in the background. Only came here once or twice.”\n\n“What sort of man was he?”\n\n“Well, from what little I saw of him, I should have put him down as a working man in his Sunday suit. I don’t hold that against him, of course. She seemed anxious to keep him in the background, though once, when my wife came on the scene, she was prevailed upon to introduce him.”\n\n“And she introduced him as her husband?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You would recognise him again?”\n\n“I think so.”\n\nHawke expressed his thanks, and left the building.\n\nOutside he bought the mid-day edition of an evening paper. It contained pictures of Mrs. Watson, of the young man, Edward Thomas, of John Blake, and of Edward Higgins, driver of the train on which Mrs. Watson had met her death.\n\n“Well, guv’nor,” asked Tommy, “what do you make of it all?”\n\n“I’m somewhat bewildered as to the circumstances under which Mrs. Watson met her death, but perhaps it won’t be long before the air is cleared, since we now know who the real murderer is.”\n\n“Since we what?” gasped Tommy.\n\n“Perhaps I am being a little rash, but the facts all seem to point to one man.”\n\n“And that man is — ?”\n\n“Really, Tommy, I must call upon you to do a little constructive thinking.”\n\n“He is not John Blake?”\n\n“I’ll put it this way. If John Blake is innocent, there can only be one other man who could have committed the crime. And the evidence we have so far all goes to show that it was, in fact, that one other man.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Photograph Proves Useful\n\nHawke called a taxi, and directed the driver to take them to the offices of the Evening Globe, where, twenty minutes later, he was interviewing the art editor.\n\n“Yes,” said that gentleman. “I can supply you with copies of any pictures that have appeared in the paper.”\n\n“I’d like one of your retouching artists to do a little work on one of them for me.”\n\nWhen they came out of the newspaper office, Hawke was in possession of a quickly-dried photographic print of a man who, in the words of Captain Willoughby, looked like “a working man in his Sunday suit.”\n\nBack at the block of flats, Willoughby identified him instantly.\n\n“That’s the fellow,” he said. “He is Mrs. Watson’s husband. I’ll swear to it.”\n\nHe called Mrs. Willoughby, who confirmed this opinion.\n\n“It is still a difficult thing to prove,” said Hawke, when he and Tommy left the flats. “Pop over to that call-box, Tommy, and ring Gray. Ask him if he can arrange for us to see the train on which the murder was committed.”\n\nThere proved to be no difficulty about this.\n\nThe train had been taken off the regular service, and was at one of the suburban sheds, at the disposal of the investigators.\n\nIn company with a railway official and a police inspector, Hawke spent some time examining the front coach.\n\nHe examined it with great care, inside and out. The search took him along the footboards to the driver’s cabin, where he seemed to develop an interest in the control levers.\n\n“I would like to question driver Higgins,” he said at length, “as to whether he had occasion to pull up between Park and Chester Road.”\n\n“He’s in the office at the other end of the shed,” said the official. “I’ll fetch him.”\n\nThe driver, wearing his railway uniform and shiny peaked cap, presently appeared on the scene. He was a man of medium height and powerful build, and his manner, as he answered Hawke’s questions, was somewhat brusque, as though he resented other people’s presence in his driver’s cab.\n\n“I did have to pull up for a few seconds,” he said in answer to Hawke’s question. “Just before we reached the old Newbury Street station.”\n\n“It’s rather important,” said Hawke, “that I should know the exact spot.”\n\nThe driver glared at him for a moment.\n\n“Well,” he said at length, “I could show it to you, if we went there. There’s a lamp at the side of the tunnel, just above the cables, with a battered top. I couldn’t swear as to how far that lamp is from the old station, but I’d recognise it again.”\n\nHawke persisted with his point, and after he had drawn the attention of the railway official to the fact that a man’s life was at stake, it was arranged that Higgins should take him for a run on the train at three o’clock the following morning — in the interval between the cessation of night traffic and the commencement of the morning traffic.\n\n“You can ride in the cab with Higgins,” said the official.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Ambitious Wife\n\nHawke and Tommy’s appointment in the early hours was at a junction in North London. Having left their car at an all-night garage nearby, they entered the deserted station in which their footsteps echoed strangely.\n\nThe train was waiting for them at the down platform, the morose-looking driver, its sole attendant, leaning against the door of the control cabin.\n\nHawke stepped into this tiny compartment, and, there being only room for the driver, in addition to himself. Tommy got into the first coach.\n\nHiggins moved the brass lever on top of the control box and set the train in motion.\n\nIt was one of the queerest trips the detective had ever taken.\n\nAt first he found the sensation of rushing headlong into a black chasm a trifle unnerving, but he quickly accustomed himself to it.\n\nStation after station flashed by as the train sped on its journey south, all the time getting deeper below the street level.\n\nThe end of a tube section, opening on to a station, would appear, at first as a tiny pinpoint of light, rapidly enlarging until they rushed through into the station, and they would then be rushing along at express speed towards the circle of solid blackness at the far end of the platform.\n\nThe train’s speed was rather higher than that normally maintained, and the unladen coaches rocked crazily from side to side.\n\nEventually they reached Berkeley Square Station, and, at Hawke’s request, the driver pulled up.\n\n“Now,” said the detective, “start off, and proceed exactly as you did on the occasion of the murder.”\n\nThe train journeyed to Park Station at rather slower speed, and stopped.\n\n“This is where Mr. Blake says he got off. Carry on — and pull up exactly where you pulled up before.”\n\nThe train drew to a standstill after another quarter of a mile or so, and its light showed the deserted platform of the old Newbury Street Station a few yards ahead.\n\n“Carry on,” directed Hawke, and the train proceeded until the first half of the front coach was actually in the station. Then Hawke signalled Higgins to stop again.\n\n“Now, Higgins,” he said, “with the object of saving Blake, whom I believe to be innocent, from the gallows, this is the suggestion I am putting forward. You did not stop the train back there in the tunnel, as you suggest — but just here. The others in the rear of the train would not know, that part of it being in the tunnel, of course.”\n\n“Well,” snapped the other, “what about it?”\n\n“Having stopped the train here, you left your cab, and stepped into the passenger-carrying section of this front coach, with the idea of having a brief word with your wife, before the signals changed.”\n\n“My wife! What are you talking about?”\n\n“Your photograph appeared in the evening paper. You were in uniform, but I had the picture retouched by an artist, who sketched in civilian clothes. That picture was instantly identified by Captain and Mrs. Willoughby. They were positive you were the man whom Mrs. Watson had introduced as her husband.”\n\nThe driver did not answer.\n\n“I suggest that seeing the coach deserted, except for your wife, you gave vent to your anger with her and killed her.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“With that control lever. It is detachable, of course, and you always take it with you when you leave the train, so that it may not be started by an unauthorised person. You had the handle with you when you stepped into that carnage, and you struck her with it. I found bloodstains on it.”\n\nHiggins looked as though about to deny the suggestion, but then he appeared to give way to a mood of dejection and resignation.\n\n“All right,” he said. “You win. I don’t particularly want another man to hang for what I did, and can’t say I care overmuch what happens to me. I’m fed up with everything.\n\n“I did kill her,” he went on. “I suppose it’s just that the curse got me after all.”\n\n“The curse?”\n\n“Just superstition that, of course, but it’s played on my mind like superstitions do. You see, I won a first prize in that Monravian Sweepstake about fifteen months ago, and I said to myself, ‘I’m not going to let it make any difference to my way of life.’ Every winner says that, I know, but I was an exception. I meant it and stuck to it. Twenty-four years I’ve been on the railway, and a railway worker I decided to stop.\n\n“It didn’t suit my wife,” he continued. “And I said to her, ‘You go on and have a good time. We’ll go our separate ways for a while.’\n\n“That suited her, and I thought that when she got mixing with a lot of stuck-up people out of her natural class she’d soon get fed up with it and want to come back to the old life.\n\n“She didn’t like the sound of the name Higgins,” continued the man with a bitter laugh. “Too common. So she used her maiden name, Watson, and went to live in a posh flat. More and more money she had, and more and more she wanted. I let her have it, until I began to realise I’d lost her for keeps. She was ashamed of me. She wanted to go over to Paris with some of her fine friends, and she wanted an extra large sum of money out of me. I found there was another man in the picture helping her to spend my money, and I determined to have it out. She was going the day after, and I sent her a note to say that I wouldn’t send the cheque she wanted unless I saw her before she went.\n\n“I told her to get on this train, and — well — you seem to know all the rest. I — I coshed her,” he added with a strange, hysterical laugh, “coshed her with this.”\n\nAs he spoke, he pushed over the control lever.\n\nHe pushed it farther and farther, and the train accelerated sharply. He pushed the lever to its limit, and Hawke saw that he was laughing crazily.\n\n“Here,” exclaimed the detective, “steady!”\n\n“… with this — I coshed her with this.”\n\nHe had taken the control lever off, and was waving it about.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA Leap for Life\n\nBefore Hawke could act — could even suspect what he was about to do — the man had thrown the lever out of the window.\n\n“You fool!” shouted Hawke. “How are you going to stop the train?”\n\nHiggins was laughing, almost uproariously.\n\n“When we come to the buffers,” he said. “Then it’ll stop.”\n\nCrack!\n\nHawke shot out his fist, and dealt the mad driver a heavy blow on the jaw, so that he slumped senseless to the floor.\n\nHawke turned his attention to the control box, but there was nothing but the square end of the key shanky and human fingers were not powerful enough to move it.\n\nHe did not understand the mysteries of the box, which was locked, and did not know whether it was possible to stop the train by pulling out a fuse.\n\nHe searched feverishly through the senseless driver’s pockets in the hope of finding the key of the control box, but he found no key.\n\nThe train plunged madly on, and was presently racing up a gentle slope into the pale light of early morning.\n\nThe lamps along the track were still alight, and it was possible to see for some distance ahead.\n\n“What’s up, guv’nor?”\n\nHawke turned to see the startled face of Tommy peering in at him. The youth had climbed along the footboard, and was holding on to the frame of the open window.\n\nThe detective motioned him to move back along the footboard, and, opening the cab door, stepped out by his side.\n\n“He’s thrown the control lever out, and I can’t see any way of averting a crash,” answered Hawke grimly.\n\nThe train was going at a speed which made the senses reel, and it was grim work holding on until they were able to climb into the passenger compartment.\n\n“We shall stand a better chance at the rear end,” said Hawke, and they ran to the other end of the coach.\n\nIt was impossible to get through into the second coach without climbing out on to the footboard again.\n\nThey were about to make the perilous trip when Tommy pointed to some iron rungs set in the end of the second coach.\n\n“What about the roof, guv’nor?”\n\nHawke nodded, and the young man scaled the rungs, his employer following.\n\nThey reached the rounded, swaying roof to find a horrifying state of affairs.\n\nAbout two hundred yards ahead the track crossed a river over an iron bridge, and a hundred yards or so beyond the bridge, on the same line, was a stationary train.\n\nA crash was inevitable within the next few seconds.\n\n“We must jump, Tommy,” shouted Hawke. “Into the river! Jump when we reach this near side bank. Our speed will carry us into the middle.”\n\nThey jumped together almost as soon as the words were out of his mouth.\n\nThey cleared the iron parapet, and felt themselves sailing on across the river whilst in process of falling.\n\nBoth were horrified to see timber-laden barges below, and it looked as though they must be dashed to pieces on these.\n\nHowever, they hit the water between two of the barges with only ten or twelve feet to spare on either side of them.\n\nTheir heads had scarcely come above water when the district was fit up by a dazzling, blue-white flash.\n\nAt the same time there was a terrific crash and next moment bells and sirens sounded, and there were excited cries from all sides. Fortunately, no one was killed, except the unhappy sweep winner.\n\nBlake was released after Hawke had outlined to Gray all that had taken place.\n\n“It seemed obvious to me, from the very first,” ho explained, “that Mrs. Watson must have had an appointment with a railwayman. The note in her handbag referred to the 9.58 southbound train. Are there many people in London, other than railwaymen, who know the exact times of tube trains — which arrive and depart within a few minutes of each other?”\n\n“H’m. I never thought of that. And it is rather a point, isn’t it?”\n\nHawke smiled.\n\n“Keeping that idea in mind,” he concluded, “I was looking for a railwayman as the possible murderer, and it wasn’t long before I saw that train driver was our man.”\n\n~ The End ~\n"

Yer middle name’s Chicken, and y’u ain’t got th’ nerve t’ scare a woodenlegged cop. Beat it before I push yer face in.”\n\n“Big” Bill, boss of the Maude Street gang, banged the table with the flat of his hamlike hand and jerked his head in the direction of the door. The freckled, sallow-faced youth standing before him, ventured a protest. Membership in the toughest gang of the neighborhood was an honor, and carried with it a prestige that was coveted by all the young wasters and loungers within a mile circle of the gang’s headquarters.\n\n“Aw, Bill,” said “The Bantam Kid.”\n\n“Y’u don’t mean that. Y’u ain’t goin’ t’ run me outer th’ ole gang f’r nothin’. Y’u can’t —”\n\n“I can’t!” exclaimed Big Bill, with vicious ferocity. “Watch me an see if I’m a liar.”\n\nThe Maude Street leader wiped his lips on the back of his hairy fist, and, assuring himself by a swift glance around the room that there were no gun-toting sympathizers with The Bantam Kid, shot out his long left arm. His victim wriggled and swore and clawed like a wild cat; but the grip on his neck tightened, and he was forced face down on the table. A glass overturned and crashed to the floor. The Kid’s snub nose was squashed into a pool of beer dregs.\n\n“Goin’?” asked Big Bill. “Or have I gotter use y’r face t’ swab up this here table?”\n\nA howl of bestial laughter went up at this novel exhibition of brute strength. The herd of assembled toughs behaved as a mob always does — they followed the example of a popular leader. The same animal instinct of savagery that sets a pack of wolves to tearing and devouring a weaker or wounded member, swayed the crowd that gathered, jostling and gloating, round the table. With no more effort than if he were holding a kitten, Big Bill carried out his threat. The Bantam Kid’s face made a wide, circular smear on the filthy table, and the mob hastily parted as Big Bill literally flung his captive through the air.\n\nThe Bantam Kid landed in a heap ten feet away, and, bellowing with laughter, the gang leader stood waiting for the vain threats, the futile splutter of curses that he expected would follow the rise of The Kid. His laughter ceased, and the others expectant of a frenzied outburst from the slowly rising victim, stood silently waiting.\n\nThe spell lasted until The Bantam Kid got to his feet and reached the door. There he turned and faced the waiting crowd. Then, in absolute silence, The Kid opened the door and passed out. He had spoken no word, made no gesture; but the stony stare of his light-gray eyes had conveyed the impression of an unbreakable resolve. He had been thrown out of the gang. Broken and disgraced he had gone, yet every tough in that room was convinced of one thing: some time in the future a bullet or a knife thrust would land in the small of Big Bill’s back, and a new gang leader would be required.\n\n“Some nerve!” muttered Bill. “Let’s have another drink.”\n\nFor the rest of the evening, Big Bill’s laugh was as loud as usual, his words as boastful; but now and again a look of haunting fear crept into his crafty, peering eyes. The poison installed in his mind by The Bantam Kid’s wordless threat was beginning to work.\n\nThe next day, Bill made the discovery that his assault on The Kid had failed of its real, ulterior purpose. He had wanted the Kid out of the gang, but that had not been Big Bill’s sole reason. There was a girl, and in evidence that she resented Bill’s coarse overtures to replace The Bantam Kid in her affections, she scared the gangster’s cheek with three long scratches.\n\n“The Kid’s gone,” she said shrilly, “but I tell y’u he’ll be back. Come near me ag’in an’ I’ll scratch yer eyes out, y’u big bluff! Watch out fer Th’ Kid. He’s comin’ back!”\n\nBig Bill swore vindictively, but for weeks he never turned a comer without keeping a hand on his gun, or passed a darkened doorway without a sidelong, furtive glance. He lost weight and the constant strain of the fear of sudden death wore his temper to shreds of peevish irritability. His nerve broke.\n\nOne night he glimpsed a shadow lurking behind him. He fired and ten seconds later discovered he had almost killed a policeman. Fortunately for him he was not recognized and the policeman recovered. But day and night Big Bill’s thoughts and dreams were tortured by visions of disaster. In fancy he died a thousand deaths. By the end of a year after The Bantam Kid’s disappearance, Big Bill was bolstering his courage with booze, and his power as a leader of the Maude Street gang was fast dwindling. Has beens are of no more use in the underworld than they are in legitimate business.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Return of the Bantam Kid\n\nThen The Bantam Kid returned, and the manner of his coming was far removed from all conjecture. According to all precedent, he should have come with a gun or knife, have carried out his revenge, and slunk again into hiding. He should have reappeared with a scowl on his freckled face, instead of which he came with a smile and, what was more astounding still, with money to bum. He radiated prosperity and forgiveness of all wrongs.\n\nWith one or two exceptions the same members of the Maude Street gang that had witnessed his going, were present on his return. And the same waiting silence fell upon them when he opened the door. Over in a corner Big Bill sat with his finger crooked round the trigger of his automatic. His coarse mouth agape, he stared fixedly at The Bantam Kid.\n\nThe tension was electric, the release amazing. Smiling at his enemy, The Kid placed a finger and thumb in his vest pocket and drew out a twentydollar bill.\n\n“Drinks round,” he said, smiling,\n\nNaturally enough, the Maude Street gang did not at once accept The Kid’s hospitality without mistrust and many sidelong glances and whispered words. Big Bill’s piggy, suspicious gaze did not miss a single move of The Bantam, but neither he nor any of the others failed to absorb the rounds of drinks that came out of the twenty-dollar bill.\n\nAs the evening wore on, it became evident that The Bantam Kid was determined to ignore all reference to the time when he had been so badly mauled and jeered at. It was generally agreed that he was all yellow and had come back to make a splurge and a show of his money. But whatever opinion was held by each member of the gang, it did not prevent any one of them from guzzling at The Bantam Kid’s expense. Some of Big Bill’s bombast returned, but he led the others in toadying to The Kid.\n\n“May as well play up t’ him while he’s got th’ coin,’’ he muttered in the ear of a fellow gangster. “He must ha’ struck it rich, but y’u can bet it ain’t goin’t’ last long.”\n\nFor over a week, The Bantam Kid showed up at the gang’s headquarters, but though he changed either a twentyor a fifty-dollar bank note each night, his wealth showed no sign of diminishing.\n\n“He must ‘ave got a roll as long as my arm,” said the gang leader at a secret conference. “But he don’t never carry more’n one bill on him or —”\n\nBig Bill’s pause was significant of what would befall The Bantam Kid if he were fool enough to carry his money in one wad.\n\n“How’d he get it?” inquired one who had laughed loudest and now drank deepest at The Kid’s expense.\n\nBig Bill snorted in disgust.\n\n“How should I know,” he muttered. “He ain’t got no nerve nor no brains either, but he must have got the coin somewhere. It ain’t phony, an’ y’u don’t pick up a’ roll like he’s got, on th’ street. What’s th’ answer?”\n\nNo one could say.\n\nThat night, various clumsy attempts were made to get The Kid to talk, but although he admitted that his funds were inexhaustible, he would not disclose how he had made his pile. The gang’s interest in the mystery became an obsession. Curiosity and greed grew to a frantic desire to learn the truth, and Big Bill brooded over the deed of violence he would commit if he could find out the place where The Kid kept his money. In the presence of The Bantam, Bill’s bloated visage wore a fixed grin, but there was murder in his drink-muddled thoughts.\n\nThen, in the monotony of The Kid’s nightly distribution of free drinks, there came an astounding break — and still more convincing evidence that his roll was no padded fake. He drove up to the dive in an automobile with a mustard-yellow body and cherry-red wheels. On the seat beside him sat the girl whose finger nails had left their mark of disapproval on Big Bill’s cheek. A diamond as big as a navy bean glistened on her finger. She rustled in silk.\n\nThe gang gathered in the doorway of the passage leading to the back room, where they held their meetings, and craned their necks in wonder. A crowd blocked the sidewalk and a policeman came up. He eyed the resplendent car with a hungry, speculative look; but although he and every detective in the precinct were aware that The Bantam Kid was scattering money like a crazy millionaire, they were powerless to do more than think.\n\nEvery one was certain that The Bantam Kid had pulled off some clever bit of crooked work; but the police were in exactly the same position as the Maude Street gang. They were all guessing.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Invitation\n\nLeaving his girl in the car, The Bantam Kid stepped out jauntily. He was dressed to kill and the smoke of his huge cigar drifted in tantalizing wreaths past the cop’s nostrils. The Kid’s grin was impudent, but it held the quality of assurance.\n\n“You may sniff at my sec-gar,” he murmured, “but y’u can’t lay a finger on me.”\n\nThen he pushed his way through the gang, wedged in the passage, and when they were all assembled in the back room, he made a little speech.\n\n“Boys,” he said, “me an’ th’ kid outside is goin’t’ be spliced t’night. We’ve got th’ house all fixed up, th’ sky pilot’s waitin’, an’ th’ eats an’ th’ re-freshments is all laid out.”\n\nThe Bantam Kid paused to let this information sink in; then he continued: “I dessay y’u fellers, not fergetting’ Bill here, is all wonderin’ how it is I come t’ be so friendly after th’ way I quit this place more’n a year ago. Well, I reckon I’ve already showed y’u that I ain’t holdin’ no ill feelin’s. To tell y’u th’ honest truth, I owe every cent of this pile of kale I’ve got, t’ Bill. I hit on a line of graft that’s a sure winner, an’ if Bill hadn’t did what he done, I’d never’ve been worth a brass nickel. So I ask all you boys t’ pile in an’ celebrate.”\n\nGrunts and murmurs of approval signified that the gang was willing to partake of anything that was free, and when The Bantam hinted that he would disclose the secret of his wealth, Big Bill led the stream of eager gangsters out to the car.\n\nWith careful observance of the speed limit, Bantam drove some twenty miles out of town. The car drew up in front of a large, isolated house, and The Kid conducted his party to a big front room. A table was loaded with food, and the buffet was packed with bottles.\n\n“Th’ sky pilot ain’t come yet,” muttered the Bantami Then he added mysteriously: “Tell y’u what, I was goin’ t’ keep th’ little surprise I have fer y’u until after we got outside them eats and drinks. I guess I’ll show y’u right away.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nPhony\n\nThirsty but curious, the gang followed the small, dapper figure to the basement. The Kid flung open a door and switched on the light. He pointed to an object that stood in the center of the bare room. It was shrouded with canvas, but there were bulges and inequalities in the gray surface that suggested some kind of machine.\n\n“After t’night,” said The Kid, “I’m going t’ break it up. It’s safer. I’ve got all th’ dough I’ll need f’r th’ rest of my life, in th’ bank.”\n\nBig Bill strode forward.\n\n“Y’u mean t’ tell us you’ve been makin’ phony bills!” he exclaimed as he wrenched off the canvas. The rest crowded round, eager to see the marvel that could turn out unlimited wealth. Then the light went out and the door closed. Blank, impenetrable darkness fell on the stunned and fearsmitten gang. There came the rattle of a can, and the muffled voice of The Kid.\n\n“There’s five gallons of gas runnin’ under th’ door,” he said. “If any of you boobs strikes a match y’u all go to — pieces. Don’t try no gun play, either. Wait fer th’ nex’ act.”\n\nA curse came from Big Bill, and the toughs, panic-stricken, started walking wildly about the enclosure. The stench of gasoline stung their throats and they broke into hoarse pleadings to be released.\n\nA sound from above stilled them to silence again and they looked up. In the ceiling was a dim, circular hole. With uplifted heads and staring gaze the gang bunched beneath the opening.\n\n“Y’u got yer own back, Kid,” shouted Big Bill. “Now let up and —”\n\nA thump that shook the house to its foundations cut short the gangster’s plea.\n\nAn avalanche of thick, viscid fluid poured over the edge of the opening and dropped in a flowing blanket over the gang. Howling with new dismay, the bunch of men broke apart but although they crouched against the wall and sought the farthest corners of their prison, they could not escape the final touch of artistry that The Bantam Kid bestowed upon them. A soft, fleecy cloud enveloped them. Then came darkness again.\n\nTwo minutes later, a yellow and red car was speeding away from the isolated house.\n\n“Honey,” whispered The Bantam Kid, “we start west t’night. I’ve been spendin’ a lot of cash lately an’ we gotten settle down t’ a quiet life. It’s a shame t’ leave all that booze an’ stuff behind, but I had t’ do things proper an’ convincin’.” Then he sighed contentedly. “The tar an’ th’ feathers an’ that junk printin’ machine was cheap, though.”\n\nFive miles farther on, the girl nestled to The Bantam’s side. “An’ from now on you’ll go straight?” she asked.\n\nThe Bantam Kid laughed.\n\n“Surest thing y’ know, kiddo. Why wouldn’t I? I’ve got a hundred and ninety thousand dollars in th’ bank. I ain’t done a crooked thing since Bill chucked me out of th’ gang.”\n\n“Then how —”\n\nThe Bantam Kid explained the mystery in twenty-one words: “I went to a uncle’s in Chicago. Played straight with him, an’ the ole boy died an’ left me his money.”\n\n“What a slice of luck!” exclaimed the girl.\n\n“Dunno ‘bout that,” murmured The Kid. “If Bill hadn’t cut up rough. I’d never of quit. Say, I guess I’ll hop off here an’ phone th’ cops there’s a bunch of blackbirds waitin’ for ‘em.”\n\nHe stopped the automobile, went into a drug store, and sent a message to police headquarters. When he reentered the motor car, he was smiling broadly.\n\n“Gee, kid,” he said, “I’d like to pipe off those guys when the cops walk in. But we’ve important business of our own on hand, ain’t we, girlie? Full speed ahead!”\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "The Russian Supreme Court has been reported to have decreed recently that carelessness, resulting in the breaking of machinery, etc., in factories and on farms, will be adjudged a crime. Offenders found guilty will be imprisoned or exiled. The defendant’s plea of “accident” is to be ignored. The fact that the offender was careless enough to permit it will be considered sufficient grounds for conviction.\n\nUnder the new ruling it will no longer be necessary to prove that workers who started fires or damaged machinery did so on purpose. Muddle-headedness and general stupidity will be regarded as criminal traits.\n\nThis new Russian decree will be hailed as one of those highly debatable rulings, with the sentimentalists lined solidly against the courts.\n\nHowever, carelessness, regardless of criminal intent, is in effect a crime.\n\nIn this glorious land of free and relatively untrammeled indulgence in bootleg hooch and hoop-la we had, during 1929 and 1930, 29,531 deaths from automobiles alone—a sufficiently large number of fatalities to satisfy the blood-lust of even the most vehement warrior.\n\nAnd Heaven only knows how many lives were lost, and what uncounted millions of dollars in property and forest preserve were burned up by careless or reckless fools, who, if they had their just deserts, should have been stood up against a wall and shot.\n\nWhether carelessness is a crime or not, the victim of its effects suffers just the same. If Billy Bohunk is cleaning a shotgun, which should have been unloaded, but which accidentally fills your valuable skin full of bird shot, you arrive in the hospital, or in the morgue, almost as certainly as though Legs Diamond himself, or one of his gallant aides, had turned a sub-machine gun loose on you.\n\nModern existence is cribbed and confined by a flock of addle-pated fools, who make life infinitely more hazardous and difficult for us than it has any reason for being.\n\nAt the intersection of any principal street in America we run the risk of imminent death a thousand times a year. Were it not for the splendid and really heroic work of our traffic cops, we’d be dodging wildeyed motorists, careening around a corner on two wheels, about half our time. And they couldn’t always miss us.\n\nWe all have heard the expression “criminally careless”, but have we ever known the expression to be more than an empty phrase? Apparently the Russian government is going to hold the term at its face value. Certainly it will be interesting to note how far their action is valuable in reducing accidents.\n\nThere is a lot to be said in commendation of the Russian idea of penalizing those responsible for accidents. It might be well if we were to take a leaf from their book. Life might not be quite so exciting. But quite a few of us would live longer—and have many more legs and arms to show the undertaker when we came to die.\n\nAgain we have passed through another Fourth of July to read the next day of hundreds of deaths over the country from explosives, from drowning, from automobile and aviation accidents. How many of those could have been prevented?\n\n~ The End ~\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  A Slaughter House\n  So He Finally Killed Her!\n  Domka’s Innocent Slip\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nA Slaughter House\n\nDawn slowly forsook the last remnants of velvety darkness, breaking over the horizon amid a cyclonic whirlpool of raging winds. Inspector Abel J . Violette shivered. His partner, Inspector Hugh Bogan, had suddenly called his attention to an almost indistinct object a dozen odd yards from the mouth of Eagan’s Court. No amount of wind could have made Violette shiver like that. The 5:30 AM, telephone call to the Fall River, Massachusetts Police Headquarters reporting a woman screaming probably was of no minor nature. Somehow, Violette harbored instincts tor the worst …\n\nThey made their way in slowly. They stopped quickly, stared down.\n\n“For the luvva Mike, Abel,” exclaimed Bogan. “It’s a woman.”\n\nThe wind moaned eerily through the underpass, plaintive with whispering sighs of despair. Began shook himself, muttered: “She’s dead!”\n\nMurder lay sprawled at their feet.\n\nShe was crumpled on her right side, her knees almost doubled up to her stomach. Beneath the guise of distorted features stamped by inexorable death, her voluptuous beauty remained unmarred. Violette bent over her. Her throat had been slashed with such terrific ferocity which made Violette wonder what kept it on her shoulders.\n\n“I’ll get the Medical Examiner,” offered Bogan.\n\nViolette nodded. Bleak, greyish light filtered into the murder court, bathing the squat brick buildings, revealing scores of neighbors with their faces pressed against window-panes. Others, braving the howling and whipping wind, drifted near Violette end the gruesome corpse. Violette wondered who made the call to headquarters, which resulted in the assignment of Violette and Bogan to investigate weird screams of terror in the vicinity of Eagan’s Court which ran 03 Spring Street.\n\nViolette asked questions, endeavoring to establish the slain woman’s identity. She remained a question mark. The crowd of morbidly curious increased. Violette’s continued interrogation proved no headway. To the neighbors, strangely enough, she remained unrecognizable.\n\nA little later, Bogan arrived with Medical Examiner Doctor Thomas Gunning. The Doctor examined the woman carefully.\n\n“A terrible way to die,” he commented, standing up. “Head nearly severed. Violette. Practically to the cranial vertebrae. It took a remarkably strong wrist to do that, now mind you, in one cruel sweep. As for the lethal\n\n“Doubtful,” he said. “The condition of her clothed lower exterior belies that. However, an autopsy will prove definitely whether or not.”\n\nWhile the woman was being prepared for removal to the morgue, Violette let his eyes wander keenly over the gathered crowd. His eyes fastened on a woman who elbowed her way through the crowd, her eyes widening into incredible pools of horror at the nearing sight of the slain woman. ‘Violette reached her just about as she opened her mouth to scream.\n\n“Don’t,” he said, not too harshly. “You know who she is, don’t you?”\n\nThe woman looked up at him, her eyes glazed. Violette turned her away from the gruesome sight, repeated his question. The woman shook her head, ridding herself of a numbing lethargy of horror. She moved her lips soundlessly. Then the words tumbled out over each other: “Yes, yes. I know. It’s Domka.” She broke Violette’s restraining grip on her arm, spun around and pointed “It’s Domka!”\n\n\n\t\n\tDomke Perembyda: She loved &amp;mdash; then hated. But she could not escape the terrible doom destiny had in store for her.\n\n\n\n\n“Domka, what?” Violette asked. “Where does she live?”\n\nThe woman was on the verge of replying when a tall middle-aged man hurried over. Disregarding Violette, man and woman conversed excitedly in a foreign tongue.\n\nRussian, thought Violette.\n\nImpatient at the interruption, Violette horned in. At his barrage of rapid-fire questions, the man said he was Jacob Maker, and the woman that Violette had been questioning, was his wife. They ran a variety store just around the corner, and their home was directly in back, right where the slain woman was found. The dead woman, Maker said, was Domka.\n\nThe name was familiar to Violette, but much to his disgust at the moment, he couldn’t place it. Her identity thus established, Violette told Bogan to comb the neighborhood and find out all he could about the victim. Then Violette, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Maker, walked into their store on Spring Street to question them further.\n\nThe Makers seemed reticent to talk. Too uneasy and ill-at-ease, thought Violette. Why? After a little verbal prodding, Mrs. Maker said that Domka was a good girl that did her work satisfactorily and never went out evenings. That, for Violette, wasn’t enough. He wanted to know how long she worked for the Makers? Where had she come from? And why didn’t she go out evenings?\n\nViolette’s last question seemed to strike the Makers between the eyes. They glanced at each other apprehensively. Violette was convinced that he had struck something tangible here. Was the fear of death the reason Domka Peremybida stayed in evenings?\n\n“Now, look,” Violette said. “I don’t want to rush you. I want to get everything straight. Let’s start from the time you hired Domka.”\n\n“She’s been with us for five months,” Jack Maker said. “We needed a girl to keep house, so we advertised for one. Domka answered, so we hired her. We got along fine. I’ve never met such a clean and industrious girl. She did the house-work. My wife and I were in the store earlier than usual this morning. We had new stock in last night that had to be stacked and put away. When Domka didn’t appear at the store this morning, we thought she overslept. You see, she was up at five every morning to light the stove. Then she’d leave the house and come to the store through Eagan’s Court. We have a little kitchen in back of the store. Domka prepared the breakfast. Then she’d go back to the house, rouse the children and prepare them for school. Of course, she had the house work to do, too. Such a pity she had to die.”\n\nWhen Violette reverted back to his questions about Domka’s friends, relations, and her strange reluctance to go out evenings, Maker shrugged helplessly.\n\n“Nobody ever came to see Domka, Inspector. We know nothing of her past life. But we did notice something strange.”\n\nHis wife started to weep softly.\n\n“My wife and I couldn’t but help feel that poor Domka lived in great fear of her life. We know that she fastened all her windows and bolted the door before retiring.”\n\n“In other words,” mused Violette, “there is a person from whom she lived in mortal fear?”\n\nThe Makers nodded.\n\n“You haven’t told me enough,” Violette said. “In the five months that Domka stayed with you-you can’t tell me that you don’t know much about her. It isn’t possible. Try to think-of letters, pictures, anything. Living in fear of someone means that she knew who-“\n\n“I think it’s a man,” Maker said suddenly.\n\nViolette’s eyes slowly narrowed. “So you think it’s a man, eh?” he asked softly. “Why?”\n\nA frightened look passed between the Makers. The husband wet his lips nervously, shifted uneasily.\n\n“A man has been watching my store for the last ten days. Every night he’d be out there, watching. I grew nervous, thinking maybe he was going to rob me. Well, on March 13, he walked into my store. I didn’t know what to do. The man scared me. I asked him what he wanted. He said he wanted to speak to Domka. I refused him, and he got angry. When I said I’d call the police, he hurried away muttering —”\n\n“Muttering, what?” snapped Violette.\n\n“It was Russian,” Maker said, “and I understood every word. He said: ‘I’ll have my way with her or one of these days —’ He left and I haven’t seen him since.”\n\nViolette’s brain bristled with angles. There was only one serious drawback. He didn’t know enough about the slain woman’s past to formulate more conclusive theories. However, one fact was certain. The slaying had two possible motives. Either jealousy or killer-inspired rage of a thwarted lover. Domka’s fears were well-founded, and her reluctance to venture out evenings was now explainable.\n\nThe man who watched Maker’s store for ten days and then asked for Domka, mused Violette, was the killer. There appeared no other feasible solution at this early stage of the investigation. On that particular assumption Domka Peremybida met sudden and horrible death that very morning of March 14th.\n\nAssured that Jacob Maker would know this man if he met him again, Violette walked out. He found Bogan at the murder scene. Bogan hadn’t obtained any helpful information. If Domka Peremybida was an enigma to the Makers, she was a riddle to the neighbors.\n\nWithout wasting time, Violette and Bogan went about their investigation methodically. The corpse had been removed, but an ugly smear of crimson stained the underpass. The trail of blood receded backwards from the congealed pool where Domka had collapsed to the back door of Jack Maker’s home. The investigating Inspectors climbed the stoop into a dark hallway. Bogan used his flashlight.\n\nCrimson tell-tale hand prints were on the wall where Domka Peremybida, her throat slashed, had placed her blood-drenched hands for support. Her intention, assumed Violette, was to reach the outside to summon aid. At the end of the narrow corridor, a door gaped open. They picked their way across the intervening space carefully, avoiding the dark pools of blood on the floor. They froze on the threshold of the kitchen … .\n\n“My God!” husked Bogan. “It looks like a slaughter house.”\n\nViolette thought so, too. The linoleum was smeared with a coating of blood. There was a long smear where some one had slipped. Most of the kitchen furniture was over-turned. Directly under the only window lay a blood-stained razor. The sash still swung in the raging wind. Violette walked over. There were red marks on the sash. On the roof of the leanto, beneath the window, were scores of crimson spots.\n\n\n\t\n\tEscape: Arrow points to window where a murderer manage to crawl through and escape.\n\n\n\n\n“Here’s the exit of the killer,” Violette said, “and also his entrance. It’s easy to figure. Domka came down here to light the stove. She never had a chance. Most likely, she never had even a split-chance to put the light on. The killer waited for her in the dark. He suddenly grabbed her by the hair, forcing her head back. There’s no question but that she knew her attacker. She screamed in terror. The murderer then slashed her throat with the razor he brought with him, dropped it, and escaped through the window. Domka, still alive, managed to get out to the underpass where she collapsed and died.\n\n“It’s a wonder Maker’s kids didn’t wake up,” Bogan said. “From what I gather, the screams had the neighbors scared witless.”\n\n“Youngsters are hard sleepers,” Violette said. “Even if they did awake, they’d be at loss, and probably fall back asleep. Now, this man that kept tabs on Maker’s store. He planned this murder. He knew he’d have to catch Domka alone and he did. He must have spotted the Makers opening up early, so he walked through the underpass, climbed into the kitchen up from the lean-to. No doubt, his purpose was to find Domka’s bedroom, but she walked into the kitchen and then-“\n\n“A murder for us to crack,” Bogan said soberly.\n\nThe blood on the window sill showed that the killer had cut himself, mused Violette. He picked up the death weapon, and carefully wrapped it in his handkerchief.\n\nThey searched the Maker house carefully in hopes of picking up a clue. They were disappointed. All they had was a razor of foreign-manufacture. However, Violette had hopes about the murder weapon. It was a peculiar type, hand forged.\n\nThe day of the murder, March 14th, wound up with straight routine investigation. The following day, Violette and Bogan endeavored to seek, if possible, any means from which they could delve into Domka Peremybida’s past life. It didn’t seem possible that she was friendless. Violette couldn’t console himself there. She was too attractive. There was something about her, even in death, that had stirred one word within Violette’s brain.\n\nSex!\n\nViolette felt that that was the answer to the whole perplexing mess, and the key was the man who had demanded to see Domka in Maker’s store. All roads leading in and out of the city were put under strictest surveillance. Railroad stations and freight-yards were watched night and day. The description of the mysterious man wanted in connection with the murder was circulated throughout Fall River, and practically every major city in New England. The waterfront was carefully searched. Suspects, of Russian and Polish birth, were picked up and questioned. They were released upon subsequent proof of their innocence.\n\n“We know that he’s a Russian,” Violette said to Bogan. “I’m riding a hunch that Domka wasn’t his wife. I’ll give you odds that we’re bucking a sex slaying, Hugh. Doctor Gunning’s report shows that she wasn’t criminally assaulted at the time of the murder. Hugh, according to Gunning, there were peculiarities on her body that convinces me, we are up against a sex-maddened sadist.”\n\n“You’re spoofing,” joshed Bogan.\n\n“Am I?” snapped Violette. “Listen Hugh. There were thin welts on Domka’s thighs and back. Almost invisible, but there just the same. They’re not recent, I’ll grant you that. Where would she get welts like that unless she was mixed up with a sadist? We can check our records on all persons involved in sex cases. Maybe we’ll come across a lead. Anyway, why didn’t she have friends? Why didn’t she go out evenings?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nSo He Finally Killed Her!\n\n\n\t\n\tChief of Police Abel Violette: &amp;ldquo;We&#39;re up against a peculiar type of criminal &amp;mdash; perhaps a madman &amp;mdash; he must be brought in.&amp;rdquo;\n\n\n\nLate that day, the 15th, the first major clue in the fiendish murder of Domka Peremybida cropped up. Captain Martin Feeney of Division Two made his findings to Chief of Police Medley, Violette and Bogan. One of his men, investigating throughout Fall River to discover more information about the dead woman, found her former residence at 2 Hall Street. Violette and Bogan hurried out, finding that residence to be a two story weather-beaten house. A kindly faced woman of Polish extraction answered the door. Upon introducing themselves, the woman bade them to enter.\n\nViolette said: “Do you know Domka Peremybida?”\n\nThe woman smiled in recollection. “Indeed. Very well … She boarded here. She moved away five months ago. I hope there’s nothing wrong.”\n\n“Domka is dead,” Violette said without preamble. “I’m sorry to say that. She was murdered! You wouldn’t have any idea of who might have wanted to kill her, have you?”\n\nThe woman’s otherwise normal breath became a sibilant hiss. Her gentle eyes dilated with terror. Her body grew rigid, her hands clenched. For a moment Violette thought he’d have a case of hysteria on his hands. But, then, the woman made a quick recovery of her facilities, paced the room nervously, avoiding Violette’s inquiring gaze. Finally, as though making up her mind, she faced the waiting Inspectors.\n\nShe said: “So he finally killed her!”\n\nViolette’s head jerked up with surprise. Here was their first major clue that he felt positive would lead to the apprehension of the fiendish killer.\n\n“Who did kill her?” he bit out. “What was his name?”\n\n“So he finally killed her,” the woman repeated. “He’s a devil that Anton. I told poor Domka to watch out for him.”\n\nEmotion overcame, suffused her eyes with blinding tears. She collapsed limply into the nearest chair. “Oh, the devil. His name is Anton Retkevitch. I hadn’t heard about Domka’s death. Everybody in the neighborhood knew that it would happen sooner or later. It was bound to happen. The devil just couldn’t leave Domka alone. Oh, God, oh … .”\n\nIt dawned on Violette suddenly. Now he recalled where he had first heard of Domka Peremybida. The name Anton Retkevitch limned the picture. About six months ago, a man named Anton Retkevitch had been sentenced to thirty days in the New Bedford House of Correction for assault on a woman named Domka Peremybida! Slow, but sure, Violette’s afore-mentioned deduction of the motive materialized. For a half hour, they listened to an unbelievable tale pouring from the landlady’s trembling lips. Violette shook his head in disbelief. It was too fantastic, but he didn’t doubt because he knew it was logical. The extremes were what amazed him. After securing Retkevitch’s address, they left.\n\nRetkevitch boarded at 27 Hall Street, and the landlady, Mrs. Bertha Fishstein, admitted them upstairs to Retkevitch’s room. Violette knocked, and a voice said to come in. Entering, Violette’s eyes rifled the room in one sweeping glance. The owner of the voice sat sprawled on the bed reading a book. The room was ship-shape. Frankly, Violette didn’t expect to find Retkevitch in the room. The killer’s past experience with Domka Peremybida was too well known around the neighborhood for him to linger around after her death. Provided of course, and yet to be definitely proven by Violette, that Retkevitch was the killer.\n\n“You’re the man that shared this room with Anton Retkevitch, aren’t you?” Violette asked sharply.\n\nThe man nodded, swinging his legs off the bed. Violette showed him the murder razor, asked him if he recognized it. The man nodded, said it belonged to Retkevitch. Upon being asked where Retkevitch was, his roommate shrugged. He asserted, however, that Retkevitch had mentioned something about going to Pittsburgh about a week ago.\n\n“What time,” Violette asked, “did Retkevitch leave the morning of Tuesday, the 14th? That was the morning Domka Peremybida was killed. Give me a straight answer now.”\n\n“Four thirty,” he answered promptly. “I heard his alarm clock ring, and I woke up. He wouldn’t tell me where he was going.”\n\nFurther questioning failed to divulge any information of importance. Once outside, Violette and Bogan separated, each taking a different side of the neighborhood. Violette wanted the story told by the dead woman’s exlandlady to double check. Three hours later they met in the Inspector’s quarters on the second floor at headquarters. They exchanged looks of stunned disbelief. They sat down without speaking for several minutes, dragging furiously on their cigarettes.\n\n“I’ll be damned,” Bogan finally exclaimed. “I still can’t believe it, Abel. We’re modern, civilized. Gosh! Stuff like that defies the imagination. Like a chapter from the life of DuBarry when she wasn’t a lady.”\n\nViolette laughed grimly. “I was closer than I thought, Hugh. Sadists may be one name for them, but monsters fits them better. They’re humans like you and I. Only they are insane subjects with an incurable lust. Retkevitch is a sadist. A dangerous one. Now, let’s see what we’ve got … .”\n\nDomka Peremybida had arrived in Fall River about six months ago. She took lodgings at 2 Hall Street, and found work in one of the numerous cotton mills. She minded her own business, and was well liked. She did, however, mention the fact that she came from Pittsburgh. Several weeks later, Anton Retkevitch came and immediately boarded at 27 Hall Street. Several days later the wheels of the first chapter of this strange drama which culminated into horrible death, took place early in the evening. Domka and Retkevitch met. As testified by numerous neighbors, Domka was terrified upon seeing Retkevitch. As one man had put it: “My God! She looked as though the very devil himself stood before her.”\n\nThey quarreled bitterly on the street corner. She left him in a smouldering rage, shouting threats. Then Retkevitch floated talk around that she was his wife. Domka vehemently denied this-saying she hadn’t married Retkevitch in Pittsburgh or any place else. The one notable feature was the strange power Retkevitch held over her. She’d never avoid him when he spoke to her. She’d listen-like a person fascinated by a deadly cobra coiled to strike at the slightest move. Then, apparently weakened by his persistence, she started losing ground.\n\nShe was a woman undecided to a point of distraction. She avoided whatever few friends she had made. She stayed in her room. Her landlady, passing outside her room one night, heard Domka talking to herself in a despairing voice. It wasn’t a question of eavesdropping; she, too, knew about Retkevitch. She wanted to help Domka.\n\nThe words sifted through the door: “Oh, why can’t he forget the past. I’ll go crazy thinking about it. I am no longer like that. I never want to be like that again. I — I want a good man for a husband. I want babies. Oh, I want to be happy. What can I do so that he will leave me alone?”\n\n“Then,” said the landlady, “late one afternoon the neighbors were amazed to see Domka and Retkevitch enter this house. Retkevitch wasn’t seen leaving. Fear for Domka’s safety impelled the neighbors to know what was going on in Domka’s room. Opposite the room which she rented from me was an unoccupied apartment. Because of this, Domka never pulled down her window shade. The neighbors gathered in the empty flat, watching, hardly believing what they saw. They could see into the room-they could see Domka and Retkevitch in close embrace. Suddenly Retkevitch tossed her on to the bed and came at her with a heavy belt upraised. He whipped her unmercifully across her bare back and shoulders. She lay there cowering, arms uplifted as if beseeching him to desist. Raw, red welts appeared on her white flesh. Finally, exhausted, she fell back on the bed, out of range of the astounded watchers.”\n\nViolette shook his head as he clipped the sheaf of reports together.\n\n“For a woman that hated a man,” he said, “she couldn’t do much about it. She was completely under his control, and had she lived, it would have been the same old story. But she tried darn hard —”\n\nIt was true. She tried to throw off Retkevitch’s domination by refusing to see him. One night, as she returned home from work, Retkevitch, lurking in the hallway, grabbed her and attempted to assault her. She did the unbelievable. Something that threw hims off entirely.\n\nShe screamed — long, terrified screams of terror. The neighbors responded to her appeal for help, and Retkevitch was held for police arrival which netted him a thirty day sentence in the House of Correction.\n\n“And while that filthy rat served time,” rejoined Bogan, “she packed dunnage and left Hall Street.”\n\n\n\t\n\tRaging, cursing, he struck her again and again until she fell back unconscious. (specially posed)\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nDomka’s Innocent Slip\n\nFrom their files, Violette secured a mug-shot of Retkevitch and hurried to Jacob Maker’s store. Maker took one look at the picture, and nodded his head Violently.\n\n“That’s him, Inspector,” he shouted. “That’s the man.”\n\nBack to headquarters, the Inspector-partners found new orders awaiting them. Chief Medley had checked their reports, and ordered Bogan to leave immediately for Pittsburgh to check the Retkevitch-Peremybida state of affairs. Violette was ordered to pursue his investigation in Fall River.\n\nWorking on his own, Violette found the sledding tough. There wasn’t a single opening to actually work from. Circulars bearing the likeness and description of the fugitive killer were sent throughout New England.\n\nRetkevitch was around 35 years old, stocky build, and weighed 160 pounds. He had a mustache, dark eyes and hair.\n\nThree days passed with no progress. Violette fumed with impatience. He knew a denouement was somewhere in the offing. Three days later Bogan returned from Pittsburgh with a story that merely corroborated what had transpired on Hall Street.\n\nWith the help of the Pittsburgh police, Bogan finally traced the former residence of the couple to Carnegie, a small railroad construction camp belonging to the Pennsylvania Railway. They operated a boarding house catering to the railroad employees, living as man and wife. But soon their neighbors and boarders got wise. They acted too unnatural and quarreled too much to be man and wife. Then they began to see things.\n\nThe people resented Retkevitch’s brutal treatment of Domka. Fearing bodily harm, Retkevitch left the town hurriedly with Domka. They landed in the small town of Conemaugh, established themselves in the restaurant business. Their life was violent. Retkevitch was maddened with lust beyond reason. She rebelled-not openly to Retkevitch, but to her better senses. She wrote Retkevitch a letter, telling him they were all through, that she was leaving, and for him not to follow her. She left, and wound up in Fall River.\n\nBut she made one innocent slip that cost her life. Naturally, after what she had been through, she couldn’t forget Retkevitch very easily. She wrote to a friend of hers inquiring about him, enclosing her forwarding address. This friend showed the letter to Retkevitch, and only God knows what was in the heart of the lustful beast when he left for Fall River.\n\nDays sped by, and no progress was made. The case against Retkevitch, however, was now air-tight. There wasn’t the slightest doubt as to his guilt. Violette knew every angle of the case by heart. Despite what had occurred when Retkevitch caught up with Domka in Fall River, she had managed to shake off his sinister influence, and had him arrested. That was the turning point. He brooded over his lost power, grew antagonistic and plotted revenge. Then he murdered her.\n\nThe clew that finally opened the trail to Retkevitch cropped up on March 28, 1914, two weeks after the wanton murder in Eagan’s Court. Thomas McGlyn, a local letter carrier, had a letter for delivery to Anton Retkevitch. It was sent in care of a grocer on Hall Street.\n\nThe letter carrier knew that Retkevitch was wanted for murder so he turned the letter over to Postmaster Durfee who, in turn, took it personally to Chief Medley. The Chief called in Violette and Bogan. They examined the letter. It had been sent by a man named Mike Petroky with 103 Salem Street, Boston, as a return address. The letter in itself was friendly. It informed that Petroky had lost his old job in Carnegie, Pa., and had come to Boston in search of work. He requested that Retkevitch write to him if there was any work in Fall River. Nothing more. It was obvious that Petroky knew nothing of the crime Retkevitch had committed.\n\n“Well, that’s that,” Chief Medley said: “Another blind trail.”\n\nViolette looked thoughtfully at the letter. “I wouldn’t say that, Chief,” he said suddenly. “That letter may, after all, do the trick and result in Retkevitch’s capture. Here’s my plan. Frankly, it’s a gamble. We’ll mail a reply to this letter to the return address with Retkevitch’s signature affixed to it. We’ll state that there’s no work here in Fall River, but that Retkevitch had had a good job on a railroad construction outfit offered him. Then we would specify that Petroky meet Retkevitch at the return address and they’d go together.”\n\nChief Medley approved the plan. The letter was mailed at once. Violette followed it on the first train to Boston, praying that somebody would claim the letter, and with the odds one thousand to one, to strike the trail of the wanton killer of Domka Peremybida. On his arrival in Boston, Violette discussed the case with the local police authorities. Inspector William Rooney was assigned to help him.\n\nWith Rooney, Violette made his way to Salem Street. The street was in Boston’s North End. It was no more than a narrow thoroughfare infested with all types of foreigners. Aged and weatherbeaten homes housed a conglomeration of men that, Violette knew, nothing short of a dynamite blast would pry a word loose from.\n\nWalking casually past 103, they noted it was nothing more than a foreign mail exchange. Foreigners landing in Boston and with no specific mailing address, used the general delivery of 103. The place was operated by Morris Bernstein.\n\nViolette, to enlighten the situation, hardly appeared like a police officer on the trail of a dangerous criminal. He was dressed in rough woolen pants tucked in his boots. A heavy mackinaw swathed his upper body. His beard was two days old. Conferring hastily with Rooney, the Boston Inspector sauntered casually across the street, and took position in a doorway. Violette walked into the mail exchange.\n\nThe main room of business was large with tables and chairs scattered around. A large, pot -bellied stove threw forth heat from the center of the room. On the right of the entrance was a long counter with an iron grillwork. Violette made his way over to the wicket, beckoned to the man behind.\n\nThe man was Morris Bernstein. Violette flashed his badge, and said: “Where can I find Mike Petroky?”\n\nThe owner said he didn’t know.\n\n“How about Anton Retkevitch?”\n\nAgain Bernstein shook his head in negative response.\n\n“Look, then,” Violette said to him. “I’m sticking around. When anybody calls for mail to either of the two men, you nod.”\n\nViolette took a seat near a grimy window, watching unobtrusively the assortment of Greeks, Poles, Russians, and other foreigners that inhabited the room. Every time the door opened, his eyes rifled over to it. Several hours slipped by, and Violette began to wonder whether or not he had himself assigned to a wild-goose chase.\n\nThe door opened suddenly. Violette riveted his eyes on it. A roughly dressed man stood on the threshold, his eyes taking in every occupant of the room. He was heavily bearded, bundled up in a long overcoat. He hesitated for several minutes before he finally made his way toward the wicket. With his heart thumping against his ribs, Violette watched Bernstein. He had a feeling, a funny feeling like a premonition. Something told him that the climax was near.\n\nThe bearded man said something to Bernstein in a low, surly voice. Violette couldn’t get the drift. However, Bernstein turned his back to the stranger and almost imperceptibly, he nodded his head. Violette got to his feet slowly, and made his way across the room. He had never seen Retkevitch personally, and this fellow in no way resembled the picture they had of the killer. The unkempt beard hid most of the stranger’s features. But Violette had that feeling. He was practically atop the man, his fingers locked on his service revolver in the roomy mackinaw pocket. He stood directly behind the stranger-\n\n“Haven’t seen you for a long time, Anton,” he said harshly.\n\nThe stranger stiffened without turning. He was staring at Bernstein with eyes that suddenly flicked fire in their depths. Then he turned, slowly. Violette ran his hands over the stranger’s person. He was unarmed.\n\n“That beard isn’t very becoming, Anton,” Violette remarked.\n\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” the stranger said. “My name is Philip Peremybida.”\n\nIt was Violette’s turn to stiffen, but with surprise. His lips curled with distaste.\n\n“You louse,” he rapped out. “You weren’t satisfied in killing poor Domka, but you had to use her name.”\n\nThe stranger, however, insisted that his name was Peremybida. If that was the case then, Violette hammered back, why did he call for mail belonging to either Petroky or Retkevitch.\n\nThe stranger had no answer. Then the telltale signs of a perverted degenerate crept out. He was yellow clean through. Despite his bulk and strength, he had a case of jitters.\n\n“You-you’ve made a mistake,” he stammered. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Petroky is sick, and he asked me to come after his mail.”\n\n“Is that so,” Violette said. “Well, we’ll see. Come on, let’s go and see Mr. Petroky.”\n\nOutside, Rooney came over, and Violette told him who he had.\n\n“He claims he isn’t Retkevitch, but he’s a liar.”\n\nThe man led them to 62 Salem Street, a broken down three-decker.\n\nAt Violette’s curt command, the fellow led the way up to the second floor. He paused outside the nearest door. Violette jabbed him With his gun. The man opened the door. They walked in. Rooney kicked the door shut.\n\nThe room was poorly furnished, and reeked with tobacco and stale am A man lay fully clothed on a duty bed. As he spotted the gun in Violette’s fist, he jumped up excitedly. Violette shoved him back on the bed, said it was police business.\n\n“You can’t push me around,” the man protested. “I didn’t do anything. What do you want?”\n\n“What’s your name?” Violette said.\n\n“Mike Petroky.”\n\n“Fine. So who is this man?”\n\nAnd Violette swiveled his gun around to the stranger.\n\n“Why, that’s Anton Retkevitch —”\n\n\n\t\n\tAnton Retkevich: He insisted that he was not the man the police wanted.\n\n\n\n\nPetroky stopped short by the warning gleam in the stranger’s eye.\n\n“Anton Retkevitch,” snapped Violette. “Don’t tell me you haven’t done anything Petroky. You’re under arrest for harboring and abetting a murderer.”\n\n“Murderer,” whispered Petroky. “Him!” His face grew waxy. He implored to Retkevitch, “Is 1t true, Anton? Did you commit murder?”\n\nViolette was temporarily convinced that Petroky knew nothing of Retkevitch’s crime. Answering Violette’s questions, Petroky asserted that several hours after he had mailed a letter to Retkevitch in Fall River, the killer arrived in Boston. Then when Violette informed Petroky who Retkevitch had murdered-Petroky stared dumbfounded at Retkevitch.\n\n“You couldn’t have done that to Domka,” he cried in disbelief. “Oh, Domka —”\n\nLate that evening, Violette arrived in Fall River with his two prisoners. Retkevitch was booked for murder, and Petroky was held as a material witness. They had no trouble in establishing the fact that the bearded man was Domka Peremybida heartless killer, Anton Retkevitch.\n\nRetkevitch’s trial came up soon, and he went on the stand a marked man. There was no doubt of his guilt. He seemed a man haunted with torturing visions of the woman he had so damnably abused and then butchered with a razor in frenzy. Every statement he made was proven a pack of lies.\n\nTo the presiding judge, to the police officials, to the spectators and public in general-Retkevitch was a murderer with a leprous stench that polluted the very courtroom air. In short time, Retkevitch was found guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death in the electric chair.\n\nOn the morning of March 14, 1915 — exactly one year from the date of the murder, Anton Retkevitch died in the electric chair. And the Fates must have laughed-for on the hour that Domka Peremybida’s killer died, she too, had died!\n\n~ The End ~\n"

To call him a brute would be hasty thinking. He didn’t read, or listen to music, or converse with his friends. Man can live by bread alone, and he did. That, and what his two acres would produce. He could read, a little, but not enough to make it a pleasure. He had no music to listen to and not enough personality to attract friends.\n\nHe lived in a shack on the two acres, about fifty yards back from the road. The shack was in the shadow of a huge elm tree, a tree that would have furnished him with stove wood for many a winter night. Hut he hadn’t cut it down. So perhaps man can’t live by bread alone.\n\nAnd he liked to look at the stars.  Winter and summer, he enjoyed that, though he couldn’t have told you why.\n\nHe’d never been taught cleanliness, or any of the other virtues. People drove by, on the highway, but he had no contact with them, no way of knowing how they lived, or why.\n\nIn winter, at Christmas, a few men would come, men who called themselves Good Fellows, and brought clothes and food, but they never stayed long. They seemed to be afraid of him, silent as he was, and dirty, and so big.\n\nIt was January, a cold, windy January night that the visitor came. He was a short man, with a high forehead, with eyes that seemed to glow like the stars. He was carrying a suitcase which must have been heavy, for it dragged his shoulder down on that side.\n\nThe visitor said, “My car’s off the road. You have a phone?”\n\n“Car? Phone?” the big man said, like a child trying out new words.\n\nThe eyes like stars seemed to burrow right into the big man’s head. After a while, the visitor smiled. “No, you would have no phone.”\n\n“Cold,” the big man said, and gestured his visitor in.\n\nCautiously, like a fox around a trap, the smaller man came in. The glowing eyes took in the wood stove, the candles for illumination, home-made candles, the sagging couch and bed.\n\n“America,” the small man said. “The land of opportunity. What is your name?”\n\nThe big man frowned. “Carl — Carl Mueller.”\n\nThe small man smiled. “German, yes?”\n\nCarl frowned again. “I do not understand.”\n\n“Your country, your country,” the little man said. “Germany.”\n\nCarl shook his head. “Here. America.”\n\nImpatience on the little man’s face, and then the smile again. “You will see what I mean, but later. It’s too cold to go on.” The eyes were not like stars, now, but like the fire when it is getting small and dim. “I could stay here, out of the cold, tonight?”\n\nThe big man nodded. “We can stay warm, here.”\n\nHe pointed outside. “The car?”\n\nHe wanted to show he understood about cars.\n\n“It will stay where it is.” The little man was looking around the room. “I, too, knew this kind of poverty.” He still had the suitcase in his hand, and he put it under the couch. “In the morning a friend will come. He has gone on to town, but he will be back.”\n\nCarl watched as the smaller man stretched out on the couch, arranging his overcoat around his feet and legs. Then the fiery eyes studied Carl’s face thoughtfully and the smaller man nodded, as though in satisfaction.\n\nCarl watched him until the eyes closed and the man’s breathing grew heavy and regular. Outside, the wind whined at the door, and the sides of the shack trembled slightly from time to time.\n\nNo one but Carl had ever slept in this shack which he had built. After a little while, he filled the stove, checked the draft, and blew out the candles.\n\nThe darkness was absolute, but he could hear the other man’s heavy breathing, and it soothed him, much as the wind soothed him. But he didn’t fall asleep for a long time. He kept thinking of those magnetic eyes, and the fervor in the small man’s voice. Surely, this was an unusual man, different from those fat and soft-faced men who’d come at Christmas. This man was like a weasel, small and quick and alert.\n\nJust before he fell asleep, a memory disturbed him; he’d seen the face before, a picture of it, at least. But he couldn’t remember where or when.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThey Fear the Strong\n\nWhen he woke in the morning, the shack was cold and he could see his breath. He could see, too, the small man standing near the front window, his lips moving, his eyes staring at nothing. He was wearing his overcoat.\n\nCarl stirred and the smaller man looked his way, and his lips stopped moving. He smiled at Carl.\n\nCarl smiled back, and threw off the covers. He crumpled paper and put it in the stove, and picked up some kindling, piling it in slowly and carefully.\n\nThere was a piece of birch about two inches through the middle, too long for the stove. Carl snapped it like a match stick.\n\nThe small man was at his side, now, watching. He stared as Carl put the two pieces of birch into the stove.\n\n“Strong, aren’t you?” the smaller man said.\n\nCarl nodded, smiling.\n\n“Strong and poor,” the other man said. “You know that’s wrong, don’t you?”\n\nCarl frowned. He could not follow this.\n\n“Strong and yet oppressed,” the man went on, and his voice had the magic in it again. “So it was in my country. They fear the strong, those who are weak. They keep them down. I changed all that.” It was as though he were talking to himself.\n\nCarl lighted the fire and watched the first flames start to climb. He watched it, fascinated as always, and then opened the draft.\n\nThe frying pan was still on the stove, the grease in it hard and ridged, flecked with black, lie watched the grease start to melt and went to the corner to get some potatoes out of the box.\n\n“I have food here,” the smaller man said. “My friend brought it this morning, before you were awake.”\n\nCarl looked at the other man, and then at the huge box near the door. “For me?”\n\n“For us. My friend took the car away. I thought it would be all right if I stayed here with you, for a while.”\n\n“Live here?”\n\nThe small man nodded. “There are men who do not like me. I would be safe here. You mt, they thought they killed me once, and they would kill me now if they knew I was alive.”\n\nCarl was staring at the smaller man. “To kill is wrong. Who would kill?”\n\n“To kill,” the other man corrected him, “is the privilege of the strong. When I was strong, I killed, had people killed. And I will be strong again.”\n\nCarl smiled. “Strong — you?”\n\nThe smaller man seemed to bristle. “Strong, yes. In the mind, I was strong.” He tapped his forehead.\n\n“In the mouth, too,” Carl thought. The little man was right; he made strong talk.\n\nThere was oatmeal for breakfast, and eggs and little pork sausages. There was coffee. There was talk.\n\nAlways, with the little man, there would be talk. The Talking Man, Carl called him in his thoughts. Though he didn’t mind it. He could shut off his ears from the talk, after a while, and listen when he grew weary of looking at the fire, or the snow drifting down outside.\n\nThe friend came back, after supper, just as the stars started to fill the sky.\n\nThe friend was a thin, blond man, much taller than the visitor, but with something of the sameness about him, a sort of fire like his in the eyes. The friend brought magazines and newspapers and more food.\n\nHe was a fine man, and looked scrubbed and rich. He said, “Leader, we can find you a better place than this.”\n\nHis thin nose wrinkled, and he looked around the room, as though he was smelling something.\n\nBut the smaller man shook his head. “No, Otto, I have an instinct about this place. I can always trust my instincts.” He nodded toward Carl. “One of ours. Strong, and with a virgin mind. What a trooPer he would make.”\n\nThey started to talk in another language then, quietly, but there was that thing in the smaller man’s voice that kept Carl from turning off his ears. That was his strength, all right, that voice. A man would believe any thing that voice told him.\n\nAfter the friend left, Carl asked, “That is your name Leader?”\n\nThe other paused, then nodded. “Because I lead. Is that a name you would like to call me?”\n\n“I’ll call you that,” Carl agreed. “You have a strong voice. I think that is your strength.”\n\n“Only part,” Leader said, and tapped his forehead again. “Here is my real strength. Carl, your strength will help us, too. And your loyalty. You will be rich, Carl.”\n\nCarl frowned. “Rich?”\n\n“Money, you will have plenty of money, you Aryan giant. You will be our American symbol.”\n\nThe voice went on, but Carl didn’t hear. He was standing by the window. The snow had stopped falling, and the air was clear as glass. The stars were bright, and so close, and all around he could see the clean white of the hills, and to the north the black trees standing sharply against the whiteness.\n\nWhen he went over to check the fire, Leader was reading one of the pile of papers Otto had brought. He was smiling as he read.\n\nIn a little while, he looked up from the papers. “Confusion, resentment, class and race hatred, mistrust. The time is almost ripe, Carl.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nTo Kill Is Wrong\n\nCarl nodded as though he understood, watching the eyes and listening to the voice. He sat on his bed, his huge shoulders hunched forward, his gigantic hands interlaced.\n\nLeader’s voice went on and Carl heard the words strong and discipline and cause related often.\n\nOnce Carl asked, “You came here for a reason, to this town?”\n\nLeader studied him. “It’s a logical town to start operations in. Many of our countrymen are here. But there must be no mistakes. The exactly right moment must be determined, and the way prepared, the organization ready, and needing but a leader. It’s drama these Americans relish. Can you think of the impact my appearance will have at the right moment? And talking to them in their language. I have learned it well, these past years.”\n\nCarl continued to nod, fascinated by the voice, not understanding exactly what all the words meant.\n\nLeader frowned. “You do not seem impressed, Carl. You have no sense of the importance, historically, of what you are a party to.”\n\nCarl could see Leader was annoyed. He said humbly, “I like to listen to your voice. I can believe what you tell me.” Now Leader smiled and said, “My Carl. My Aryan giant. I’ll clean you up and buy you a dozen bright uniforms. You will be a figurehead. You will have all the food you can eat. And money, Carl, great amounts of money.”\n\n“The rich have the money,” Carl said. “Not me.”\n\n“The rich will be dead, and the strong will be rich, Carl. We are the strong.” He flexed his arms. “You here.” He tapped his forehead. “And I here.”\n\n“We will have their money?” Carl asked.\n\n“And their power.”\n\nCarl frowned. “They will be dead. We will kill … . It is wrong to kill!”\n\n“The strong can do no wrong, Carl. You are strong. We will take what we need, for our purposes. That you must learn. The strong can do no wrong, and in this country, money is power, the big power, the only power, really.”\n\n“I believe you,” Carl said, and nodded, though it wasn’t anything he could digest in a short time.\n\nBut this man was his friend, bringing good food and plenty of talk, not ashamed to live with Carl, this little nun he’d seen a picture of somewhere. Carl squinted a little, in the dim light, studying that pale face.\n\nLeader said. “You’re looking for the mustache, Carl?”\n\nThat was it Carl’s mind groped and remembered the pictures, and he said softly, “Hitler.”\n\n“So long it took.” The voice wasn’t much more than a whisper. “And now you appreciate the historical impact?”\n\nThey were not words Carl understood.\n\nHe said simply, “I believe you, Leader.”\n\nThe small man seemed to glow.\n\n“They thought I was dead.”\n\nAgain, he tapped his forehead.\n\n“As if any of them can kill this. You believe in me; there are others, many others who will believe. Strong men will be needed soon, Carl. Leaders. The time is coming when the confused, the depressed, the fearful will look for leaders, and figure-heads and symbols to renew their faith and their spirit. We shall come, before any others can seize that moment. Not only here, but in our mother country, Carl, the lines are again forming. In all the countries of the world, we have our workers.”\n\nCarl tried to understand, but his attention was wandering. He didn’t think Leader would like it if he went to the window again, but he wanted to see the white hills and the bright stars. He could pretend to check the stove and thus get a glimpse of the flames.\n\nHe went to the stove. He bent to pick up a stick of fire wood, and remembered how his strength had pleased Leader. Smiling, he took an even larger stick and snapped it in his hands.\n\n“The strong,” he said. “We will be on top.” He displayed the broken pieces.\n\n“You understand,’’ Leader said quietly. “Otto would not believe I could make you understand. They don’t know how well I understand you.”\n\nCarl smiled and watched the flames. But he continued to think of the stars, and he could stay away no longer. He went swiftly to the window and looked out.\n\n“Someone’s coming?” Leader’s voice was sharp.\n\nCarl shook his head. “No, I wanted to look at the stars. I like to look at them.” Leader came to stand next to him, and he pointed out at the road, where the headlights were sweeping by.\n\n“There,” he said quietly, “are the stars you should watch. That is our world, Carl.”\n\n“But not pretty,” Carl said. “Nothing to watch.”\n\n“We shall remake it to suit ourselves.” He put a hand on Carl’s arm. “They need me, my workers. They would not understand a man like you, or how to deal with them. That is why I cannot be replaced. They would think you stupid, because you are quiet and strong. They do not understand the strong nor the mystical as I do. You will be high in the party, Carl.”\n\nCarl smiled. “And rich. A lot of money.” He thought of the fat-faced Good Fellows, so superior and quick to leave. “We will kill the fat, rich ones and take their money. It is not wrong for the strong to kill.”\n\n“To improve the race, or get the things we need, it is not wrong to kill,” the man said.\n\nA vagrant thought, born of his memory of the Good Fellows, came to Carl. “Does Otto hate my smell? He wrinkles his nose.”\n\nLeader chuckled. “You are watchful, my Carl. Otto will wrinkle his nose many times before we are through. But he will come along with us, because he is a snob, and the wrong people are in power. We will buy Otto a gas mask if the odor gets too strong.”\n\nHe laughed, and Carl laughed, too. Carl watched the car’s headlights until Leader sat down with his papers again. Then he watched the stars, and the woods and the white, clean snow. Behind him, the fire crackled, and the pages of the newspaper rattled, and he felt secure and good.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nTo Kill Is Not Wrong\n\nLater, when the lights were out, when there was no sound but the crack of the cold outside, and the cracking of the fire in the stove, Carl lay with his eyes open, going back over the flood of words. He could remember the ones that had been repeated often — kill, purpose, strong, money, fools. He fell asleep with the words running through his mind.\n\nThe days went on, and the cold held, but Carl didn’t mind staying inside. He had Leader for company and good food and pictures in the magazines to look at. Otto the nose-wrinkler came quite often, and each time after he left, Leader would frown for a while, as though the news was bad.\n\n“Something is wrong?” Carl asked one day.\n\nLeader nodded. “The time is not ripe, here. But in my own country many in the party are again in power. They are the efficient ones, you see, and needed. It is possible I will go back there first.”\n\n“You will leave me?” Carl asked.\n\n“For a while. You will be forgotten, Carl. Destiny has chosen your humble shack as a shrine. Your time will come.”\n\nCarl thought of the food he’d eaten these past days. That would go with leader.\n\nThe stars were not as bright to Carl, thinking of the food he would be missing. He didn’t hear Leader’s monologues, remembering the steaks and chops, the white rolls and rich butter. Otto had brought chickens, already roasted, from town, and hams, and duck.\n\nOne afternoon, Otto brought Leader’s car back. The cold was less and the sun bright, and Leader went out in the yard to talk to Otto.\n\nCarl sat inside, near the stove, a coldness in him as be thought of the good life he would be missing. If Leader had never come, it wouldn’t have mattered. But leader had brought food and talk to shorten the cold days, leader had stirred him to what could be, with power and money.\n\nHe saw Otto and Leader shaking hands in the yard, and then Otto went to another car that was waiting on the highway, the motor running.\n\nWhen Leader came in, he smiled at Carl. “They worry about you. But I don’t. You will keep our secret. You are one of us now.”\n\nCarl nodded, not thinking of the words. He had some words of his own. “You are leaving?”\n\n“Tonight. When the stars are out. I will drive all night, so this afternoon I must rest. You will miss me, Carl?”\n\nCarl nodded, thinking of the chicken and duck.\n\nLeader pulled the suitcase out from under the bed, the suitcase he hadn’t moved through all the days.\n\nLeader said, “Germany is ready, and I am going back. But I will come here, again, to this very place. And you will be waiting, Carl.”\n\nCarl was at the window, looking out at Leader’s car.\n\n“When will you come back?”\n\n“Who knows? A year, a decade. This much I know — I will be back. Patience, Carl.”\n\nCarl turned to see the suitcase open, open and crammed with money. His eyes widened.\n\n“This must be distributed to the organization,” Leader was saying. “I will leave it with our organization leaders before I sail. But you are a part of the organization now, Carl.”\n\nHe pulled out a thin packet of bills and handed them to the big man.\n\nCarl couldn’t keep his eyes from the rows and rows of money still in the suitcase. He took the thin packet of bills and looked sadly at leader. He went over to sit on his bed.\n\nWords and pictures were moving through his mind, the pictures of food, the words the Leader’s. He put his head in his hands, thinking of the fine rich food.\n\n“Parting with friends is always sad,” Leader said quietly, “but remember I will be back, Carl.” He was stretching on the couch. “I must rest. It will be a long drive to the boat.”\n\nCarl’s mind was confused and he sought through the maze of pictures and words to find some to express what he felt. Then the vision of the food left and he kept seeing that money in the suitcase. That was food, too.\n\nBut it was Leader’s. To steal is wrong. To lie for a purpose might be right, to kill\n\nThe shack was getting colder, and Carl went over to put some more wood in the stove. Leader was breathing steadily and heavily, now, his eyes closed.\n\nThe words came to Carl, the repeated words, The strong can do no wrong. To kill is not wrong. To improve the race, to kill for a purpose.\n\nThe piece of wood was heavy in Carl’s big hand and he stared at it for seconds before he walked quietly over to the couch.\n\nThe first blow was at Leader’s strength, at his forehead. The skull cracked like a walnut with the blow. Carl was still pounding long after the head and face was just a pulp … .\n\nLater, Carl tried to dig a grave for Leader, but the ground was so hard that he quit after digging a few feet. He put the suitcase in the hole, for safekeeping, and leveled the ground after burying it.\n\nLeader he carried out to the car waiting near the road, and put him in the back seat, and closed the door again. Now he would have ducks and chickens and steaks. He would tell no one about the money; it was his. He had killed for it.\n\nWhen the men came, later, to ask about the body of Leader in the car, Carl shrugged and lied, because lying is not wrong. But they saw the dried blood all over his hands, and finally, in that smoky room in town, he admitted it was his work.\n\n“To kill is not wrong,” he told them. “He told me that, to kill is not wrong.”\n\n“Did he, now?” one man said. “And who was he, Carl? You knew him well?”\n\nBut that was Carl’s secret, and he just shook his head and repeated, “To kill is not wrong. The strong can do no wrong.”\n\nSo Leader was listed as unidentified, and properly buried in the charity graveyard, and Carl went to prison. There was no capital punishment in this state.\n\nIt was a big gray building, but warm, and the food was better than Carl had known before Leader. After a while he even had a cellmate, a talkative little Irishman, and at night, through the bars, he could see the stars. It wasn’t so bad.\n\n~ The End ~\n"

      "content_html": "There is no law against being fond of playing the horses; and even if a man is unemployed and on relief and has a wife and four kids to support, there’s not too much you can do to him if he still retains his fondness for betting a few bucks on the ponies. But Vernon Oldaker’s list of “credits” went far beyond this. He was a former bookie, a bigamist, a man who had deserted two wives, a convicted thief — and, finally, a murderer.\n\nThe ironic part of it all is that he not only killed the one woman who had gotten him on relief and who had added to this by continually giving him money out of her own pocket, but he also left enough obvious clues to point to himself as the killer and ended up by virtually inviting the police to come and get him.\n\nVernon, his wife, and his four children all lived in what was little better than a shack on the outskirts of town, and it was only through the kindness of Anne McKee, an elderly and very wealthy philanthropist, that none of the Oldaker family starved. Miss McKee saw to it that Vernon was placed on relief, that he got his check regularly, and that he didn’t lack for a few extra dollars, which she gave to him herself. But, even so, the family came close to starvation many times because Vernon liked to play the horses.\n\nIt was an old story — he’d bet and lose and then bet some more trying to make back his losses. The only result was that the relief money seldom went for feeding and clothing his family. Instead, it was spent on Vernon’s efforts to prove that he was a first-class handicapper — which he certainly wasn’t.\n\nOne March morning, Vernon woke up to the fact that all his relief check had been spent. He was broke, but he was sure that this was only temporary. Miss McKee would take care of him again, and Vernon was positive he could pick a real winner this time.\n\nHe wasted no time in going to her house, and he found the old woman alone in the big house — alone and not exactly anxious to give him any money this time.\n\nShe refused flatly, even though Vernon tried to play on her sympathy by pointing out that his family would starve unless he got some money to feed them. It didn’t work. Miss McKee knew from bitter experience in the past with Vernon that any money she’d give him would go to the nearest bookie and not to the neighborhood grocer.\n\nVernon kept on begging, then he started to argue, but Miss McKee was adamant — she wouldn’t give him a cent. Finally, when Vernon became even more persistent, Miss McKee told him to follow her and she’d show him that, even if she wanted to help him, she didn’t have any money in the house that day.\n\nShe led him out into the hallway to where her purse was lying on the table. Vernon noticed a hammer there also, but didn’t bother to think about who had been using it or how it had gotten on the table.\n\nMiss McKee picked up her purse, her back to Vernon — and that’s when Vernon lost control of himself.\n\nHe grabbed the hammer and swung it at Miss McKee’s head. He missed, and the hammer went over her head and thudded into the wall. Vernon drew back his arm and swung again before Miss McKee could get away from him. He hit her this time, and then he kept on swinging, the hammer missing and striking the wall almost as many times as it hit the woman.\n\nWhen it was all over, and Miss McKee had fallen to the floor, Vernon had hit her four times in the head.\n\nShe looked dead. There was enough blood all over her head, but Vernon had to make sure. He went out to the kitchen, picked up the sharpest knife he could find, and came back to the hallway. He made certain by using the knife.\n\nHe was sure she was dead now. He dropped the knife and dragged the body back into the living room. Then, remembering that he had come there for money, he searched her desk, found a checkbook, and tore out a handful of blank checks. He went back to the hallway, got her purse and the hammer, and left the house.\n\nThere was only nine dollars in cash in the purse, and Vernon tossed it and the hammer into the river before clearing out of town. He had left the knife behind, and while this might not have been an important clue, it didn’t really matter because Vernon proceeded to put the finger on himself as the killer.\n\nHe forged Miss McKee’s signature to five of the blank checks during his travels — and he was foolish enough to make out three of the checks to himself.\n\nNaturally, the bank reported the matter to the police when the checks came through, and the police now knew for certain who the killer was. The usual bulletins went out, and the usual routine search was started for a wanted man.\n\nVernon eluded the police for a while, but then he apparently decided that it was time he wrote home to find out how his wife and family were making out — since he had left town without even letting them know about it. He wrote to his wife from another city, being careful not to include a return address. It was never made clear just what he hoped to accomplish by writing to his wife and not giving a return address, but the police now had a definite lead as to his whereabouts.\n\nThey checked the postmark, informed the local authorities in that city, sent along a description of Vernon, and the rest was just a matter of time. Vernon was picked up on the street just a few days after he had mailed the letter.\n\nHe broke down easily under police questioning, and confessed to the crime. At his trial, he tried to plead insanity. Even though he certainly had behaved in a peculiar manner — not trying to cover his trail after the killing — the plea wasn’t allowed. It may have helped, though, because Vernon did manage to cheat the chair.\n\nHe was found guilty of murder in the second degree and sentenced to life in prison — where going on relief and playing the ponies are not a part of everyday life.\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  After the Trial\n  Divorce\n  Destitution and Disillusion\n  Courage In His Eyes\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe state tried Dr. Hyde for the murders of Colonel Thomas H. Swope, James Moss Hunton, and Chrisman Swope, and with having attempted the deaths of Mrs. Hyde’s four sisters, co-heirs of Colonel Swope’s great fortune. Found guilty and condemned to life imprisonment, he appealed the case, and the Supreme Court of Missouri declared him the tragic victim of an organized hate.\n\nThe opinion flayed the prosecution, and after three subsequent trials. Dr. Hyde was released, an innocent man, in the eyes of the law. But he was to learn that his release did not return him to his old standing in society, although the law had not found him guilty.\n\nChapter 1\n\nAfter the Trial\n\nIncredible as it may seem, all that Dr. Clark Hyde suffered while undergoing trial as a fiendish poisoner — the pain, the shame, public hate, and the shadow of the gallows — was as nothing compared with the years of heartbreak that followed his acquittal. He who had been in hell for so long a time was forced to plumb new and deeper hells by the mean fears of his fellow men, in December for old friendship’s sake, seeing him for the first time since what was supposed to be his Vindication. Had he remained in prison, locked in some dungeon away from the sun and air, the years could not have treated him more savagely.\n\nSnow white hair thatched a face scored with lines that looked to have been gouged out by some jagged flint, and the bright blue eyes, from the very fixity of their courage, were weary eyes, unutterably sad for all their challenge.\n\nWe talked for hours, and as the floodgates of his heart opened wide, he told of the loss of wife and children, of false friends and malignant enemies, of ostracism and shattered hopes, of loneliness and struggle, yet never once, in all the swift stream of his speech, was there a note of hate or bitterness. Strange indeed, for if ever one had the right to curse God and man, that one is Dr. B. Clark Hyde.\n\nMuch of the tragedy lay in its unexpectedness. In April of 1917, when the state abandoned its prosecution, and the law confessed his innocence, Clark Hyde faced the future in joy and confidence. No doubt marred his happiness; no foreboding chilled the iron courage that had sustained him throughout his terrible ordeal. At his side stood the wife who had broken with mother, brothers and sisters out of her love for him, her faith in him; and two children, a boy and a girl, who had come to take the place of the little one who died at birth, in 1910.\n\nHe was only forty-five, strong, resolute and still possessed of the splendid abilities and dynamic energy that had carried him to the forefront of his profession. And what more natural for him to assume than that society, having whipped him with thorns, would rejoice at the opportunity to atone for the cruel injustice that had brought him so close to a shameful end on the scaffold. What he did not count upon was the moral cowardice that squirms in the mud at the bottom of human character.\n\nAt the time of his arrest and arraignment in 1910, Clark Hyde had been the examining physician for two life insurance companies, and while these posts had not been of any large importance in his days of pride, he now turned to them as a quick and necessary source of income. On presenting himself at the offices, however, he met with embarrassed attempts at evasion, and on pressing the matter, learned that the executives were of the opinion that his retention would “hurt business.” It was not that they doubted his innocence, they assured him glibly but simply that the notoriety of his case made further employment unwise.\n\nWhen the Swopes branded him as a poisoner, Dr. Hyde had also been on the staff of two principal hospitals, and in the absence of any formal notification of discharge, he assumed that the places were still open to him. The hospital authorities, however, received him as had the insurance companies. They, too, were full of congratulations on his acquittal, and voluble in assurances that they had never believed in his guilt, but in the matter of any further connection with their institutions, they felt that his association might “prove detrimental.”\n\nWhen the Sons of the American Revolution, of which he had been an honored member, ignored his existence, and when other societies dropped him from their mailing lists, Dr. Hyde began to see what he was up against. He saw it still more plainly when men who called themselves friends came to him with the advice that he go to some foreign country and start life over again under a new name. But there was fighting blood in Clark Hyde — blood of Edward Hyde, first earl of Clarendon, and blood of General George Rogers Clark — and the suggestion that he turn tail and run fired him to battle pitch.\n\n“No,” he cried. “They may starve me, they may kill me, but by the living God, they can’t make a coward out of me. After fighting for seven years to prove my innocence, am I now to confess guilt by sneaking off to some hiding hole?”\n\nJaws squared, he opened an office and set grimly to work to regain the profitable practice he had enjoyed before the charge of poisoning was brought against him. At the very outset, however, he was struck down by the action of his own profession. A Library Society had been recently formed by certain physicians  — more of a social body than official — and Dr. Hyde was invited to join. He had no need of it and even the small annual dues were more than he could afford, but he leaped at the invitation, seeing in it the hand of fellowship and affection. His name went to a vote and was blackballed.\n\nFor once his iron control broke down and out of his rage and hurt he wrote a letter to the president, charging that the action had been due to the enmity of members who had been on the pay roll of the prosecution throughout the trials, and who sought his continued disgrace in order to justify their acceptance of blood money. An angry letter, indiscreet in every line, and the Jackson Medical Society, obtaining it, straightway accused Dr. Hyde of “unbecoming conduct,” and moved for his expulsion.\n\nThere was a vote of the full membership, and when a majority refused to uphold the charges, the matter was carried to the State Medical Society, and this body, by an absolutely arbitrary exercise of power, ignored the vote and ordered Dr. Hyde’s expulsion. Now came a complicated series of court proceedings. A circuit court judge denied his petition for a mandamus, the Court of Appeals overruled the circuit judge, and the Supreme Court overruled the Court of Appeals.\n\n“Had my client been any other man,” his attorney told him, “I would have won. But the prejudice against you is so great that I doubt if you could recover on a promissory note past due and unpaid.”\n\nWhichever way the marked man turned, he found advancement blocked. It was not so much that people were hostile as that they were afraid. He was the “notorious Doctor Hyde,” and what did it matter that the notoriety had not been of his seeking, and that a high court had found him the victim of persecution?\n\nThe brave thing was to take him by the hand; the easiest thing to avoid him, and so it was that he found himself imprisoned by a wall of ostracism as high as that of any jail yard. And in the hour when his dauntless spirit flagged a terrible and unexpected blow struck him down. His wife sued him for a divorce.\n\nMrs. Hyde, even more confidently than her husband, had counted upon his acquittal to work a change in public opinion, believing implicitly that he would be restored to his former high standing without question. The action of the insurance companies, the Sons of the Revolution and the hospitals, followed by his expulsion from the Jackson County Medical Society, were cruel disappointments, and as the months went by without any lessening of the organized avoidance, a profound despair possessed her.\n\nBack of this breakdown of spirit were many physical and psychic shocks, each one more violent than the other in its attack upon the seat of reason. The ghastly charges leveled against her husband; the break with her family; the three terrible trials; the death of her five — hour — old boy in 1910; her own long convalescence, with its overhanging fear of cancer; the anguish of soul to find that Dr. Hyde’s acquittal was without power to change the prejudices and fears of the community — what wonder that the unhappy woman gave up the fight and surrendered to melancholia?\n\nDr. Hyde saw her condition not only with the eyes of a husband, but the eyes of a physician, and frightened as never before, he fought desperately to beat back the danger that threatened the foundations of his home. With the two little ones digging at his side, he grew the mother’s favorite flowers in the small backyard; at night he taught them those poems that she loved most, and sought to hedge her about with tenderness.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nDivorce\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nFor a while it seemed that normality had returned, and when Mrs. Hyde and the children left for the north in the summer of 1920, the parting was most fond. Dr. Hyde himself went to Washington on a business trip in September, but when there came a sudden cessation of letters from his wife, he hurried home in the grip of a vague alarm. He found an empty, shuttered house, and on visiting Mrs. Hyde’s lawyer, an old friend, to discover the whereabouts of his family, received the curt information that they did not mean to return to him. Everything, the attorney assured him, would be conducted in such a manner as to avoid notoriety, but even as the stricken man stumbled out into the street, newsboys were calling extras that carried the news in huge headlines.\n\n“I am instructed by Dr. Hyde neither to dispute nor deny,” said his attorney in open court. “The memory of her unfailing love, his deep and lasting gratitude for her years of courage and sacrifice, close his lips. Whatever she wishes is his wish. Whatever she wants he will do. There is just one question\n\nI must ask in justice to my client. Mrs. Hyde, is your divorce action based in any degree on a doubt as to your husband’s innocence of the crimes that were charged against him?”\n\n“No,” she answered firmly. “I am absolutely confident that Dr. Hyde is altogether innocent. I know that he is absolutely innocent.”\n\nEngrossed by the consideration of his own and his wife’s problem, Dr. Hyde had forgotten the children. Or, rather, it had not entered his mind that he would not be permitted to share in their custody, or, at least, to visit them regularly. Now, striking through his daze like a lightning bolt, he heard the judge enter an order that forbade him ever to see or to communicate with his wife or his little ones. Leaning forward, with all the agony of his soul in his eyes, he implored Mrs. Hyde with a looked but she refused to lift her eyes.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nDestitution and Disillusion\n\nSmall wonder that the man’s iron courage gave way. Throughout the seven years of accusation and trials: throughout three years of unsuccessful struggle to regain his place in society, never once had he bowed his head, but as he walked out of the courtroom, suddenly bereft of wife, children and home, despair engulfed him. Giving up his offices, and abandoning the profession to which he had devoted his life, the wretched man found work as a common teamster in the employ of a sand company. Two days only did he held the job and then the boss issued a curt notice of discharge.\n\n“Why?” asked Dr. Hyde.\n\n“We don’t need you. That’s reason enough.”\n\nWith what little money was left to him, he entered an automobile school, and took a course in mechanics, but when he had finished it and looked about for work, he found every avenue of employment closed against him. Now virtually destitute, he turned his face to Lexington, a little town some fifty miles from Kansas City where he had Spent his boyhood, the son of a loved and honored Baptist divine.\n\nA sister lived there, and from her he borrowed the money to go to New York for study that would fit him as an eye, ear, nose and throat specialist. For a year he toiled day and night, and then returned to Lexington and resolutely swung his shingle to the breeze.\n\nA typical Southern county seat, this little town of Lexington, its people kindly enough, but intensely conservative. They met Clark Hyde courteously enough on the streets and in the church, but they did not take him into their homes nor did they throng his waiting room. For ten weeks he sat in his office, and not once in the whole of that time did he hear a footfall outside his door or see the knob turn under the touch of a hand.\n\nThe sweat stood out on his forehead as he talked of those terrible weeks. What if no one ever came? The fear froze his heart! To be forced to accept defeat — to creep away from the regard of those who knew him as though he were indeed evil and depraved — to drag out his days in some obscure corner of earth. No, no! Better death!\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nCourage In His Eyes\n\nAt last one evening, just as he was preparing to lock up and go out for his lonely meal, there sounded a knock and in walked a worker from the coal mines on the edge of town. A stranger, knowing nothing of Hyde or his history, he had seen the doctor’s sign in passing, and came in to ask about a serious ailment of the ear canals.\n\n“Your first patient after ten weeks?” I exclaimed. “How did you feel?”\n\n“I could hardly see him for my tears,” answered Dr. Hyde.\n\nThe miner sent others, and through the break in the Chinese wall soon poured an increasing stream of patients. Gradually, as the people of Lexington saw him in church and watched his life, a certain amount of friendly feeling succeeded suspicion and avoidance. But like that unhappy master, whom disaster followed fast and followed faster, some blast of the old hate would blow in from outside just as he seemed to have won his fight.\n\nIn 1929, for instance, a well-known lawyer of Detroit published a book on “The Cross — Examination of Witnesses,” and in it he spoke of Dr. Hyde as “the heartless murderer of Colonel Thomas H. Swope,” the author of “a series of horrible events unparalleled in the annals of American criminology,” and gave the impression that Dr. Hyde was an inmate of the Missouri State penitentiary, serving a sentence of life imprisonment. Under instant threat of a libel suit, the publishers called in every book, and accepted Dr. Hyde’s own statement of the case for insertion in the new edition.\n\n“If only they had charged me with anything but poisoning,” he said somberly. “No other accusation carries such horror or creates a more lasting aversion. There is something about it so cowardly, so creeping, so unspeakably reptilian, that one’s shrinking is almost instinctive. But I win back,” he continued, his voice determinedly cheerful. “I win back.”\n\nTurning around, he pulled out some programs that showed his membership in the Lexington Men’s Chorus, and a clipping from the local paper that commented on his interest in securing federal help for the improvement of Lexington’s battlefield. He put them forward with an effect of casualness, as if they were unimportant, but, shooting an upward glance, I saw a passion of pride in his eyes, a gratification so pathetic in its intensity that I could not swallow for the lump in my throat.\n\nTo talk to the man is to come to instant appreciation of his essential loneliness, for every word shows that his companions have been books rather than human beings.\n\n“Have you never lost courage?” I asked him.\n\n“No,” he answered. For a moment he sat silent and then raised his head. “Don’t you see, George, I dare not. If I lose my faith in God and His ultimate justice, where am I? Where am I?”\n\nPain and weariness stood revealed as the cry came from him, but as I turned back after leaving him, I saw him straightening his shoulders bravely enough, setting his face in its former effect of determined cheerfulness, and putting the courage back into his eyes.\n\n~ The End ~\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Hereward Carrington\n  Octavus Roy Cohen\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAgain we place on the records the results of a brief investigation into the lives and habits of two outstanding contributors to The Illustrated Detective Magazine. The authors of “Science Fingerprints a Ghost” and “The Hollywood Bridal Night Murder” (both of which will be available on the site in coming weeks!) have submitted to our questioning.\n\nSummarizing the involved cross-examination:\n\nHereward Carrington\n\n\n\t\n\t&quot;Herewood Carrington&quot;\n\n\n\n\nHereward Carrington was born October 17, 1880. He was educated in England and this country, and became a member of the Society for Psychical Research in 1900, when but nineteen years of age. He has made this subject his lifework ever since, visiting Europe several times in the course of his investigations, as well as traveling all over the U. S, and Canada.\n\nHe has “sat” with nearly all the important mediums, during the past thirty years, and has carried on an extensive correspondence with the more prominent researchers throughout the world. He is a Member of the Society for Psychical Research, permanent American delegate to the International Psychical Congresses — attending , the first, held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1921 — Research Officer of the American Psychical Institute and Laboratory, and was a member of the “Scientific American” Committee of five, appointed to investigate occult phenomena.\n\nProbably nowhere in the world is there a person who has devoted himself so completely and so wholeheartedly to the investigation of psychic phenomena as Dr. Carrington.\n\nHe attended more then half a hundred seances with the medium Margery, and as many with the famous Eusapia Palladino; he has “sat” also with Mrs. Piper.\n\nHe is the author of some seventy books on psychic and allied topics, covering all phases of the subject. His latest book “The Story of Psychic Science,” is a complete summary of the subject from the Greek Oracles to date. Dr. Carrington is thus a noted author and lecturer, as well as an investigator of international repute, and has earned for himself a reputation of being a sane, cautious worker along these lines. His estimates of phenomena may always be taken as fair, clear, and impartial.\n\nDr. Carrington is also noted as a bridge player, and has published a book on the subject. He is tall; his hair is almost white; and he is distinctly good-looking. At one time he estimated that if all the time he had spent in a dark room (for his seances) was put together, it would amount to three years.\n\nBeyond this point, the Court ruled, Dr. Carrington need not testify. All further facts concerning his work could be found in his writing.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nOctavus Roy Cohen\n\n\n\t\n\t&quot;Octavus Roy Cohen&quot;\n\n\n\n\nOctavus Roy Cohen was born in Charleston, South Carolina, on the twenty-sixth day of June, 1891.\n\nHe attended — but insists was not educated in — the Porter Military Academy. After intermediary years in which he devoted himself to newspaper work, and the law, he sold his first story (the 130th he had written!).\n\nMr. Cohen alternated thereafter between his continued assaults on editorial citadels.\n\nOne series of his negro short stories has run over thirteen years.\n\nIn 1914 he married, and since 1915 has made his home in Birmingham, Alabama. In 1916 his son was born and Mr. Cohen reports that helping the boy with his homework has been giving him a belated education.\n\nIn 1927 Birmingham-Southern College made him a Doctor of Literature.\n\nMr. Cohen has always been an enthusiast on sports, playing handball at least three times a week. He enjoys golf and tennis, is a baseball fan and a lover of football.\n\nBasketball, six-day bicycle racing and ice hockey are also among his hobbies. In the South he is considered a football authority.\n\nAt one time he was known as an amateur boxer.\n\nIn personal appearance he is five feet, eight inches tall; blond; slender; weighs 145 pounds in his clothes.\n\nHe has sold more than forty motion pictures, twenty-three books, and has had five plays produced.\n\nHe is a member of the Authors’ League of America, Roebuck Golf and Country Club (Birmingham), Artists’ and Writers’ Golf Association, Omicron Delta Kappa fraternity and Birmingham Athletic Club.\n\n~ The End ~\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  On the Legit\n  Stormy Is Through\n  Out To Murder Stormy\n  Helen Barlow\n  Money Would Tempt Her\n  Who Did She Marry?\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nOn the Legit\n\nNick Pavoni’s stall was a cafe he called Caesar’s Grill.\n\nUpstairs were a dozen private dining rooms. Behind these rooms was Nick’s office, which had a private stairway leading down to an alley. The affairs of the cafe were managed from the steward’s office downstairs. Nick’s office was for his private and most profitable business. It was also a meeting place and council chamber for Nick’s mob.\n\nIn his youth Pavoni had been a window washer. There was a certain organizing ability in the man, and he became a contractor with some dozen window washers in his employ. While poised on the sills of office windows, Pavoni’s eyes had many times rested on shiny, black, fat safes. Ideas came to Pavoni and in time he sold out his business, Pavoni was a rugged, powerful man. He had a very wide head with florid cheeks. His eyes were calm, almost gentle in their depth of brown. They were partly screened by thick black eyebrows. He had a wide, thick-lipped mouth. He liked to grin, chiefly to flash the gold front teeth of which he was very proud.\n\nHe turned his brown eyes gently on “Stormy” Lake.\n\n“I sent Mario and Tony out to knock over some filling stations,” he said. “You got to keep these young ones working. Mario, he won’t be much good. But Tony is going to come up. I want you to watch him, Stormy. Next time we, have something big. I think maybe you can take him along. That boy is made for better things than filling stations, remember that. Next time you crack a box. I think you take him, eh? Take him for target. He’s not afraid to use a gun, but he’s no fool. That’s the trouble. They either turn yellow in a pinch, or they go killing a lot of people and get the whole town turned upside down.”\n\nStormy Lake flipped a cigarette into a cuspidor. His blue eyes were suddenly strained. He started to speak, but Nick Pavoni cut him off.\n\nRed has found us a box. I tell you there’s another good one — Red. That boy hustles, and he’s in the know. It is at the Murdock Mills. They pay off on Saturday, but draw the cash Friday afternoon. It is at the mill office all Friday night. There is a watchman. Johnny and Angelo will take care of him. Tony will go with you and stay outside. Phil will drive. You can make the safe very easy; it is a Reliance … .”\n\n“I can’t, Nick! That’s why I wanted to see you … .”\n\n“You can’t!” Pavoni leaned far back to laugh. “You’re the quiet one, Stormy, the modest one. That’s why I like you. There’s no big talk … .”\n\n“But I can’t, Nick. I mean it. I’m through — quitting!”\n\n“What!” Nick struck his hands to his thighs. He said in almost a whisper: “You do what?”\n\n“I’m going to quit. Getting married, Nick. Going into business on the legit.”\n\nNick laughed jovially. “Oh, is that it? Well, Stormy, that’s O.K. What kind of business?”\n\n“I’m buying a garage. Good stand.”\n\n“That’s fine. You’re the wise one, Stormy. A garage — that will give you a front, a stall. And besides it will be useful. If she is O.K., getting You know better it will be useful, married is not so bad, than to blab.”\n\n“You don’t get me, Nick. This isn’t a front. I’m quitting. Cutting the whole business out. The garage will be on the up-and-up. The girl won’t stand for me being on the hook. You’ll have to get somebody else.”\n\nThose gentle brown eyes clouded, then glowed with a sullen fire.\n\n“Are you crazy? Do you know what you say? Gees, do you think being in a mob is like jerking soda water or slinging hash, that you can go to the boss and say, ‘Get somebody else, I’m through’? What the hell are you trying to put over, Stormy? Is this some double-cross?”\n\nPavoni kicked his chair to the wall. He swaggered across the room, smashed a card table from his path, and stormed back with face blood red and eyes ablaze.\n\nHe halted suddenly.\n\n“Last year your cut was eighteen grand. This year it is twelve already. And you come to me and say, ‘I quit’. Just when things go so smooth. Everybody satisfied. No bulls stirring us up. No trouble. I am thinking tonight — I am saying to Red when he tells me of this job, ‘Stormy will open it. Stormy is the goods. No foolishness. Always ready. And never bungles. A man that can use a gun to open a getaway without leaving any meat behind. That’s what I say to Red. That’s what I think of you. And now you have turned yellow for a twist. You’re sure crazy, Stormy.\n\n“There is no quitting. When you are in a mob, you are in! You know that. Did you ever hear of anybody pulling out of a mob? If I tell the boys, you know what they will do. But I like you, Stormy. You’re my right-hand man. We worked this bunch up together.”\n\nPavoni’s voice dropped to a whisper.\n\n“I don’t say a word to anybody. We just forget it. Ditch this dame that is taking the stuff out of you.”\n\nHe stopped to pat Stormy on the shoulder.\n\n“Tell me what you need for Friday night.”\n\nStormy stood up.\n\n“You sure are making this tough, Nick. Yeh, I know I cut plenty dough with you. But who opened the cans and got the dough? I figure we’re about even on that. As for all the tripe about nobody ever quitting a mob, that may go for some of these cheap guns you got out kicking over filling stations, but not for me. I’m through with the racket. You can get somebody else for my end of your capers.\n\n“You don’t need to suppose I’m going to turn stool because I’m getting married. Where would I get off? I’m in as deep as anybody. You’re a hell of a friend, you are. I thought you’d grab my mit and slip me a present or put on a banquet for me.”\n\n“Forget that cheese.”\n\nNick waved his arm at the door.\n\nStormy turned.\n\n“Good-by, Nick.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nStormy Is Through\n\nPavoni did not answer. Stormy stood in the door. Tall, dark, clear-eyed, he was good looking in a rather hard way. Pavoni watched him for a long minute. Then he paced along the floor. He reached out his hand.\n\n“All right, Stormy, we may as well be friends, I guess.”\n\nStormy’s face relaxed. He shook Pavoni’s hand vigorously.\n\n“You’ll get somebody else for Friday night?” Pavoni grunted.\n\n“But drop in before then, if you change your mind.”\n\nPavoni sat very still for a long time after Stormy left. At last he pressed a button for a waiter.\n\n“Is anybody here, Slats?”\n\nThe waiter nodded. “Johnny and Angelo are in seven with a couple — “\n\n“Chase Angelo in.”\n\nAngelo had been drinking. He slapped Nick on the back and called him “Big Boy.”\n\nPavoni scowled and waved Angelo to a chair.\n\n“What’s up? You look like you was headed for the hot squat.”\n\n\n\t\n\tAngelo had been drinking. He slapped Nick on the back and called him &quot;Big Boy.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nPavoni swore softly.\n\n“Maybe I am. You too — and all of us.”\n\nAngelo’s eyes lifted.\n\n“It is Stormy,” Nick said quietly.\n\n“Gees! You mean he’s picked up an’ squealed?”\n\nPavoni shook his head.\n\n“Not yet. But Stormy tells me he is through. He is getting married and quitting the racket.”\n\nAngelo lighted a cigarette. “Well?”\n\nPavoni pressed a buzzer. “Bring a couple shots for me and Angelo, Slats.”\n\nIt was the first time Angelo had seen Nick really drinking whisky.\n\n“Who is this jane that makes so much trouble?” Pavoni asked hopelessly.\n\nAngelo shrugged.\n\n“You know Stormy. He tells nobody nothing. He brings no women here.”\n\n“You remember Butch, Angelo?” Pavoni asked.\n\nAngelo nodded. “They fired him for some cigar store stand.”\n\n“You’re right, Angelo. Butch and Scar Maloof and a kid named Strenger pulled it. Butch and Scar got fried. They caught them because some witness drove into a garage one day and seen this Strenger kid working there. The witness called the cops. The garage boss said Strenger had been working for him a year and was a fine kid. The witness must be mistaken. The cops took Strenger anyway. They worked on him. That stick-up was a year and a half before. The kid hadn’t fired the shot that killed the sap. Now he was going straight. So he pilled and rapped Butch and Scar. They got the juice. The kid was held for about six months. Then they gave him probation.\n\n“You see what happens when a guy goes straight? He turns yellow.”\n\nAngelo leaned forward.\n\n“What’re you going to do? Put Stormy on the spot?”\n\nPavoni grinned and shook his head. “There is another way. We try that first. Maybe then Stormy comes back to us. He is a good man, if this girl had not made him yellow. You know the Clinton School? Well, on Tenth Street by the school is a little store. It is one of these stores near schools that are kept by old women and sell penny candy and pencils.\n\n“This store is run by Mother Molloy. The store is a front. Mother Molloy is a fence. She is an old friend of Stormy. He told me once when we were all in a jam that she keeps his money planted for him. That is so he can get it quick and easy. Stormy has not yet bought this garage.\n\n“Mother Molloy closes her place at nine o’clock. You and Tony will go there. You see that nobody but the old woman is in the store, then at nine o’clock you enter. Tony covers her. You lock the door and pull down the shades. Take her into the back room and make her tell you where her money is hidden.\n\n“Tie her up and stuff something into her mouth so she can’t yell. Take a candle with you. That would be a good way. Hold the candle to her foot. She will tell you. That way we get Stormy’s dough and he can’t buy his garage. Be careful what you do out there. I don’t want any killing. You had better cover your faces. So long as you don’t kill her everything will be fine. She can’t holler copper.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nOut To Murder Stormy\n\n\n\t\n\t&quot;A fine break those hyenas of yours gave me! Sit down!&quot;\n\n\n\n\nTwice Angelo and Tony went out and found men in the store at nine o’clock. The third night they caught her alone. Angelo told her to nod her head when she was ready to come across. Tony wielded the smoking candle. Angelo watched her face.\n\nShe was a tough old woman and held out for a long time. The first time they stopped she tried to scream for help when they took the gag out. There was no fooling about the second time.\n\nThey found fourteen thousand dollars and a handful of diamonds that had been torn from their settings.\n\nPavoni was very pleased when they got back to Caesar’s Grill. It was the best haul of the year, apart from the disciplinary effect on Stormy. Pavoni took half, the rest was split two ways.\n\nBut Friday came and Stormy had not returned to the gang. And they could not try the safe without him.\n\nPavoni waited two more days; then sent Angelo and Tony out to murder Stormy. There was nothing else to do. Pavoni hated trouble. But you can’t let a fellow live after he’s turned yellow. One question from a cop and he’ll fall apart and spill everything.\n\nPavoni lay sprawled on a couch in his office while he waited for Angelo and Tony. At his elbow was a bottle of whisky and cigarettes.\n\nSlats, the waiter, knocked at the door. Pavoni asked what he wanted.\n\n“O’Day and Schultze are downstairs. They asked for you and are coming up. What’ll I tell them?”\n\nHell! Here was a break. Angelo and Tony had gone out to kill Stormy and were not back. And these two bulls had come. Pavoni was sitting upright and wiping sweat from his face.\n\n“What’ll I say?” hissed through the door.\n\nFrom the lowered voice Pavoni knew the detectives were coming up the stairs. Maybe it wasn’t about Angelo and Tony. There was no use staving these dicks off. He’d have to see them eventually.\n\n“Let ‘em in,” Pavoni growled.\n\nHe heard Slats’ footsteps go and return. A knock on the door.\n\n“Come in!” Pavoni boomed.\n\nO’Day and Schultze entered.\n\n“Hello, boys. Have a smoke?”\n\nO’Day shook his head.\n\n“You been here all night, Pavoni?” he asked.\n\nPavoni glanced at his watch.\n\n“Since seven o’clock,” he answered. “Why?”\n\n“What are you sweating about, Pavoni?” O’Day demanded.\n\n“Nothing. It’s hot up here.”\n\nThe two detectives laughed.\n\nNo one spoke for a minute that seemed endless to Pavoni. Then Schultze asked: “Where’s Angelo and that fellow he’s running with?”\n\nPavoni spread his palms.\n\n“How would I know? Angelo, I think he was here tonight. He eats downstairs.”\n\nThe two detectives laughed again.\n\n“They’re friends of yours, ain’t they?”\n\n“Sure, they’re my friends. Quit stalling and tell me what you want. What’s the matter with Angelo?”\n\n“Oh, nothing much,” Schultz said. “We picked him and that other kid up tonight.”\n\n“What for?” breathlessly.\n\n“They were trying to drive two ways on a one-way street,” O’Day chuckled. “Traffic cop followed them. Thought they were drunk. They used the whole street from curb to curb. But they weren’t drunk. They were just shot! Both of ‘em. In the right arm. They got dizzy trying to drive some place to get their wounds dressed. The young kid had fainted. Angelo was at the wheel. Of course Angelo didn’t know who did the shooting. They were just waiting for a couple of girls, Angelo said. Some fellow walked up to them and bang! bang! They both got it in the arm.”\n\n“That’s too bad,” Pavoni commented. “It’s getting fierce the amount of lead that’s slung around these days.”\n\n“You don’t know who might have done it, Pavoni?”\n\n“How would I? They’re young fellows. They been horning in on a tough guy’s girl, maybe.”\n\n“Funny about them both getting it in the right arm,” Schultz observed.\n\nThey started for the door and Pavoni sighed his relief.\n\nO’Day turned.\n\n“Anyway, we’ll cool those boys off for six months when they get out of the hospital. They were packing rods.”\n\n“Like hell you will,” Pavoni muttered when the door was closed.\n\nPavoni stood helpless for a minute. There were a lot of things to be done. He must first learn what hospital they’d been taken to. Then he must get a lawyer to them. And he must send one of the boys over to put the fear of hell into Tony. It was the kid’s first pinch and he might get careless with his tongue. Angelo was all right. Angelo knew the ropes. Angelo was smart. But he hadn’t been smart enough to give Stormy the bump!\n\nSomeone knocked on the door to the private stairway. Pavoni glided across the room.\n\n“Who’s that?”\n\n“S-sh! Open up, Nick. It’s me, Angelo!”\n\nNick wanted to laugh. Angelo was smart. A bolt slid back.\n\n“Get a move on!”\n\n“All right, all right,” Pavoni answered. Angelo’s voice sounded funny. Sounded like he was crying. Again Nick wanted to laugh. Imagine Angelo crying. But that arm hurt, maybe. Pavoni turned another lock and opened the door.\n\nA revolver stuck its ugly mouth into the room. The firm hand that held it appeared. Then Stormy.\n\nPavoni made one play for his revolver. Stormy’s gun jumped six inches. Pavoni dropped his hand and sighed.\n\nStormy reached a hand back, closed and locked the door. He crossed the room and slid a bolt on the other door that led to the hall.\n\nPavoni’s eyes followed that leveled revolver around the room in a nauseating fascination. He suddenly felt old and weak. He was sick. There was a horrible hard ball in his stomach. He was icy cold and shaking.\n\nHe tried to speak, but his throat was so dry he choked. At last he managed to curl his tongue into words. They came fast and in a whispering hiss:\n\n“Stormy! For God’s sake! We been pals. You’d give a fellow a break … .”\n\n“Yeh, a fine break those hyenas of yours gave me! Sit down!”\n\n“Stormy. I swear it! I don’t know what you mean. Why did you say you were Angelo? Why do you come like this with a gun to an old friend and say I gave you no break? I have done nothing to you. If you kill me this second, I die swearing I am your friend and have not hurt you.”\n\n“Well, don’t fall apart. If I was going to kill you, would I have locked my getaway door? Where’s your brains?”\n\nPavoni sighed and relaxed. Of course, he had been a fool not to think of that.\n\nStormy’s left hand was in his coat pocket.\n\n“Sit down at your desk,” he said.\n\nPavoni obeyed.\n\nStormy flung a package of typewritten sheets before Pavoni.\n\n“Read em.”\n\nPavoni picked up the papers. He saw they were carbon copies. He started to read and gasped explosively.\n\nHe looked again and his jumping eyes followed the words:\n\n \n\n&quot;NORTHERN FUR ROBBERY AND MURDER.Red Scanlan located job. Nick Pavoni organized and led the raid on this warehouse. I, Stormy Lake, went along to open safe. Robbery netted furs valued at $60,000, which were fenced to Joseph Bloom $12,000, and $8,000 cash in safe.Members of gang committing robbery were: Nick Pavoni, Angelo Nicassio, Johnny Wills, and myself, with Skeets Mullin driving stolen truck.The watchman was lured to a back door and slugged by Angelo. While the furs were being loaded watchman came to. Angelo saw the watchman&#39;s open eyes taking in the bunch, and slugged him again. The watchman was found dead.The weak sisters in on this job are Johnny Wills and Bloom.&quot;\n\n\n\nPavoni looked up, trembling. His fingers massaged his thick neck. “You had this on you when — when … .”\n\n“Yeh, when Angelo and Tony tried to bump me,” Stormy finished. “Read some more. It’s all there. Thirty-eight jobs. Three murders.”\n\nPavoni fingered the pages.\n\n“Well, what do you want, Stormy?”\n\n“Not a thing. I just wanted you to see those sheets. The originals are in a sealed package in my lawyer’s safe. They remain there as long as I live. When I pass out, the package goes to a relative of mine. He’s on the level and you don’t know him. If I die a natural death, the package will be burnt without the seal being broken. If I don’t die a natural death, the package is to be taken to the district are attorney. Think that over, Nick.”\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nHelen Barlow\n\n\n\t\n\tPavoni rather admired and respected Miss Barlow.\n\n\n\n\nAt one o’clock the next day. Pavoni was in the office of Charley Gaige, criminal lawyer extraordinary.\n\nHelen Barlow, Gaige’s secretary, smiled and said Mr. Gaige was out to lunch, and that he wouldn’t be back that day as he was going to court.\n\nPavoni knew Miss Barlow slightly. He admired her, and respected her inaccessibility to a man of his type.\n\nHe grinned amiably now and said he didn’t want to see Mr. Gaige.\n\nShe showed him a surprised smile, and waited.\n\nPavoni leaned over the railroad partition. “I just wanted to see you, Miss Barlow. You can help me  — we’re old friends, eh?”\n\n“Of course, Mr. Pavoni,” she laughed.\n\n“Well,” Pavoni said with oily smoothness, “I just wanted to know if Stormy, Mr. Lake — you know Mr. Lake?”\n\n“Of course, we know Mr. Lake. He’s with you, isn’t he? Or one of your friends, anyway.” ‘\n\n“Yes. Stormy’s with me. And I just wanted to know if he left that package — that sealed package — for Mr. Gaige to keep in his vault?”\n\n“Oh, Mr. Pavoni. I know Mr. Lake is a friend of yours, but I don’t know if I should tell you anything like that. Won’t you call Mr. Gaige at his home this evening? I’m sure it’s perfectly all right, or you wouldn’t ask me. But Mr. Gaige would think I was careless or didn’t have the proper respect for the confidence — ‘”\n\nPavoni laughed heartily.\n\n“That’s all right. You told me now. Because if he hadn’t left it, you would just have said ‘No’.”\n\nMiss Barlow bit her lip.\n\nPavoni chuckled.\n\n“It is nothing. Don’t look worried. Now I want to do you a big favor.”\n\nShe looked puzzled.\n\n“First I want you to come to dinner with me at the Ritz tonight.”\n\n“Oh, Mr. Pavoni!”\n\n“Well, why not?” Pavoni asked. “I’m a harmless old fellow. It just happens that I could do you a big favor. I could put you in the way of making a lot of money. Don’t ask me how. I’ll tell you this evening. You’ll come? If you don’t want to go into it, no harm done. Shall we say six — thirty, or seven?”\n\nShe bit the end of a pencil, smiled doubtfully, but at length said, “Seven.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nMoney Would Tempt Her\n\n\n\t\n\tShe passed him the envelope and took the balance of the money.\n\n\n\n\nPavoni left the office satisfied. He had guessed shrewdly. Gaige was the attorney of all the big shots in town. He was Pavoni’s lawyer. And naturally be was Stormy’s lawyer. The thing that had puzzled Pavoni for a time was how to reach that vault. His gang could break into Gaige’s office. But as well to contemplate the Federal Reserve vaults as that one of the lawyer’s. Gaige had built his practice through a reputation for squareness. He had never thrown down a client. Had never broken faith with one. But Miss Barlow was the weak spot in Stormy’s armor. She was a fine young woman, Pavoni conceded. But she was poor; and, he was confident, money — a lot of it, of course  — would tempt her.\n\nShe was waiting for him at the hotel. He strode over to her with an easy grin on his florid face.\n\n“Oh, Mr. Pavoni, I’ve been so worried. I don’t think I should have come. I think Mr. Gaige might not consider it right for me to have dinner with a client — at least without his permission.”\n\nPavoni closed his big hand around her slender, soft arm. “Don’t you be foolish, Miss Barlow. Gaige wouldn’t care. Besides, it’s after office hours. You’re not working for him now.”\n\nReluctantly, she let him lead her to the dining room. Pavoni knew how to buy favors. They had a sheltered table for two near, a window. But the dinner was not a great success. Pavoni felt out of it here. He was too big, too rough, for this fine place. Miss Barlow was nervous. She picked at her food and gave all her time to anxious glances about the dining room.\n\nWhen nothing remained on the table but small blacks, Pavoni got to business.\n\n“You’ll be wanting to know what I got up my sleeve, Miss Barlow?”\n\nHe laid his big elbows on the table and leaned toward her. “I don’t stall, Miss Barlow. I want that package Stormy left with Gaige. It’s worth ten grand — ten thousand — to me.”\n\nHe sat back and waited. He hated to pay that much, but Miss Barlow wasn’t cheap. Nothing but real money would make her a crook.\n\nShe gasped and looked at him intently.\n\n“That’s impossible. Terrible. I must go. Why, you’re insulting.”\n\nPavoni’s arm shot out. He almost held her in the chair.\n\n“Listen. You won’t be hurting Gaige. You won’t be hurting Stormy. There is nothing in that package that’s worth a dime to Gaige or Stormy. But it’s worth ten thousand to me.”\n\n“No.”\n\nPavoni sighed.\n\n“Fifteen thousand,” he offered.\n\n“Please take me out of here. I don’t want to create a scene.”\n\n“For God’s sake, girl, you’re mad! Twenty thousand. That’s what I’ll give you! Think of it. Twenty thousand in one lump. Do you know any other way you will ever get your hands on that much at one time? What can you do with that much coin? You’re young, and smart. Think what it means!”\n\nPavoni was holding her arm all the time. He felt a little quiver run through her body, then a slight relaxation. He let her play with the figures a while.\n\n“Oh, but I couldn’t, betraying Mr. Gaige.”\n\n“He’ll never know, Pavoni said quickly. “You get me that package. Then I’ll fix it up and you can put it back in there. Nobody will ever know it’s been opened. And you’ll have your stake.”\n\n“No. I couldn’t do it. I’m ashamed to stay and talk to you about it. It’s wrong.”\n\nHer refusal was not quite so vigorous now. But Pavoni was nearly crazy with worry. He couldn’t sleep while that cursed history of the gang lay in Gaige’s vault. Suppose some other gang took a shot at Stormy? Suppose the damned snitch got himself killed in an automobile accident? Pavoni and the gang would burn sure. He broke into a sweat. If it cost every dime he had in the world, he must get that package. He’d put the gang on the hustle to make up what he paid.\n\n“Please call for the check and take me out of here,” the girl begged again. “Please!”\n\nPavoni smiled at her. He wanted to clamp his big fists around that slim white throat. For a minute the rage that boiled in his brain held him breathless. He made a last desperate plunge.\n\n“Thirty thousand dollars!” he whispered.\n\nShe moaned, and Pavoni knew he had her. People near by glanced up.\n\n“Smile!” he hissed.\n\nHer eyes gleamed with tears; but her lips turned up in a miserable smile.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nWho Did She Marry?\n\n\n\t\n\tPavoni was nearly crazy with worry. Gaige must never find out.\n\n\n\n\nPavoni wasted no more time. He pressed ten one thousand dollar bills into her palms right then. Safer to let her play with some of the money than with the idea. He made swift arrangements for the transfer of the package and the balance of the money. He took her to a taxi and drove home with her. He kept her jollied up with visions of what she could do with thirty thousand dollars.\n\nHer decision made, she brightened a little. Pavoni left her confident that she would live up to her bargain.\n\nAnd for himself, he intended to live up to his. He hated to throw out that much money, but he had to shoot square with this girl. If he tried any double-cross at the final exchange, there was no telling what she would do. She might go and confess everything to Gaige. Pavoni would have the telltale papers, anyway. But there was no telling when you needed Gaige. Why, it might be worth a hundred grand to have Gaige with you.\n\nPavoni chuckled as he dropped into bed. If Stormy managed to keep alive for one more day, the gang was safe. And twenty-four hours after Pavoni got that package, Stormy would be a dead man.\n\nPavoni waited in the lobby of the McClellan. In two minutes she should come. He broke into a sweat as he thought of the possibility of an accident to her. Now that the package was nearly his, he was mad with anxiety. A wave of relief that left him weak passed through his body. She was coming.\n\nHe nearly dragged her to a secluded corner. She reached within her coat. Pavoni watched her with wolfish eyes. Her fingers held a long white linen envelope.\n\nPavoni smiled, and brought a wallet from his pocket. She passed him the envelope and took the money.\n\n“Count the money,” he urged.\n\nShe ran her fingertips across the edges of twenty one-thousand-dollar notes. Pavoni was examining the envelope and its seal. He smiled.\n\n“You better get that to a safe deposit box, if you have one,” he advised.\n\nShe nodded. “Good-night, Mr. Pavoni.”\n\nHe walked downstairs to the washrooms.\n\nHis fingers tore futilely at the linen envelope. Luckily, he had a knife. In the envelope were many sheets of typewriter paper. On the top sheet, Pavoni read the words:\n\n“A Gangster Never Squeals”\n\nHe turned over the other sheets.\n\nThey were all blank.\n\n“I be damned! I be damned!” Pavoni stood for five minutes repeating the words. He couldn’t think straight. Where did he stand? He felt the dazed freedom of an unfettered slave. Relief. Joy. Anger. He felt them all; but which was right?\n\nHe caught himself saying, “Good old Stormy.”\n\nThen next second remembered he had planned to murder Stormy. He hurried down to Caesar’s Grill. Had a bottle of whiskey sent up to the office and lay on the couch drinking. At midnight he dozed off in a drunken sleep. It was the third time in twenty years that Pavoni had been drunk.\n\nIt was nine in the morning when Pavoni came out of his sleep. He had a mean head and was ugly. He didn’t give a hoot if the girl didn’t know what was in the package. He’d get that dough back if he had to throw the girl and Gaige both through their windows.\n\nHe had to wait in the corridor for twenty-five minutes before Gaige arrived.\n\nThe lawyer unlocked the door. “Come on in.”\n\nGaige held a gate open for Pavoni to precede him into the lawyer’s private office.\n\nPavoni shook his head. “I want to see Miss Barlow.”\n\nGaige was surprised. “She won’t be down. She has left me.”\n\nPavoni gasped.\n\nThe lawyer looked puzzled as Pavoni stood there rooted to the floor. “Miss Barlow has gone away,” he added with a smile.\n\n“Where?” Pavoni snarled.\n\nGaige laughed. “Well, she didn’t say exactly. But she told me she was leaving the city for good — with her husband. She got married yesterday morning.”\n\n“Who?” Pavoni roared. “Who did she marry?” -\n\n“Didn’t you know?” said Gaige. “Stormy Lake!”\n\n~ The End ~\n"

      "content_html": "Late morning sunshine tried to chase the gloom from the room where Cora Shepard ranged in restless impatience. Her too old young face was white where the carelessly applied rouge did not light false fires, and her usually carefully dressed brown hair was rough and tumbled. The soiled kimono she held about her by one twitching hand was torn at the shoulder to show unbelievably white skin, as soft as any petted lady’s.\n\nAs the door swung open she snapped querulously:\n\n“‘S a fine time to bring breakfast” and stopped short as a tall man gently closed the door behind him.\n\n“Not your old Katie with the toast, my fine girl, but your Corrigan with a jolt for you. Katie had hers when I made her let me in — now — let’s see.”\n\nCora did not answer, but turning her back, went to gaze unseeing out of the window — at least there was freedom there.\n\n“Might as well be sweet about it, Cora, for you know we have been watching you night and day. And you might as well come clean with all the dope on the Westerman girl’s murder, for we have your friend Frank, and we’ll get your brother Bill, too. But listen, now; if Frank would give us a nice neat little confession, we could see the way clear to forgetting a lot of things — such as your look-in with the Norton blackmail, the Hotaling forgery, and so on. We know your brother is guilty as hell, of Course, and you know it, too, but the thing is to get the proof.\n\n“And how the papers are roasting the ‘chief, and the whole department. Somebody’s gotta be the goat, that’s all. We’ve sure got the pan hot, and gotta have somebody to fry.\n\n“Give us time and we could hang the murder on your brother, but time is one little thing we ain’t got, with the papers and the public, too, yapping on our heels.\n\n“Now, listen here, sister, do me a favor, and save yourself — and save Bill — from the chair. Y’see, this Frank of yours is crazy to see you — why, I don’t know, for he was loony about the Westerman girl. Fact is, that’s why we can slam the murder on him so dead easy. He was there that night, we know, but your brother was there, too, after Frank. But we can’t find a witness, that is, a witness that’s any good, for what you say wouldn’t go far with a jury — and you Frank’s common-law wife.\n\n“So there’s only one thing that’ll clear your brother, and that is for Frank to come clean with a confession. That’ll give you and your no ‘count brother time to clear out. No doubt Frank will only be sent up for a few years–some soft governor will let him out. It’s your only chance, Cora, for I tell you we’ve got a bad case on Bill.”\n\nThe detective sauntered to the window, where he stood by Cora’s side, looking out, for a moment.\n\nSuddenly she flung away from him as if he was poisonous.\n\n“Get out of here! When I want to see Frank, I know where he is, and as for a fake confession, I’m not your stool-pigeon, Corrigan!”\n\n“Fake? How’d you get that way? How’d you know he didn’t kill the Westerman girl? Believe me, my fine girl, he thought enough more of her than he did of you — enough to kill her if he thought she was double-crossing him. You know what he cared for your tantrums. Yeh! and for you, and what name you had left, too! Why, he used to lay bets on you — down in Tony’s — bets — God, how rotten a guy .can get! And you think he loved you? Say, that’s the limit! I’ve seen Frank Conroy kissing the paper that had Ruth Westerman’s name on it — after he had made your name one that — “\n\nHe paused, for the fury in Cora’s eyes startled him.\n\nHoarsely she muttered: “All right — bring him along. I’ll find out — find out — — “\n\nThe detective looked pleasantly cheerful as he swung about to open the door. The bell had been ringing some minutes, but Cora’s maid was too terrified by Corrigan’s authority to answer.\n\n“Ah! Here we are!”\n\nTwo plain-clothes men entered with a handcuffed man between them.\n\n“Morning, Frank. Lil’ call on Cora, eh? You’re the boy for the early visits to your lady friends, what? Cora here is all out of sorts, because I’m just telling her she’s booked for a trip up the river; her and that no-good brother Bill of hers. Queer how you guys expect to get away with things. Cora’s been the queen blackmailer of Riney the Rat’s gang for too long, and now Bill goes and croaks your jane, Frank! Some speed to Bill’s trip to the chair, I’ll say!”\n\nCorrigan seemed pleased with his little monologue, and after a glance at Cora, whose back’ was turned, seated himself comfortably in an arm-chair.\n\n“Now, boys,” he said to the plain-clothes men, “you can beat it out a while. I’ll manage this little seance. The main thing is to let the lady and the gent have a farewell chew.”\n\nThe men let themselves out, and Corrigan yawned.\n\n“Well, folks, speak up! Can’t you say ‘dayday’ to Frank, Cora? I ain’t got all day to hang around. If you got anything to say, get it over. Me, I’m all in. I’ll just park myself on that lounge I lamped in the back room as I came through the kitchen a bit ago. Give you half an hour for your love spiel,” and he leered.\n\nGone, the room became a dead place without the vividity of his presence.\n\nCora still stood gazing blankly from the window, and Frank was apparently rooted to the spot, speechless.\n\nAfter a moment he licked dry lips and spoke:\n\n“Cora, Cora, can’t you even speak to me? I begged them to let me come, for I knew you’d get some garbled tale of the killing, and though I was sure you would not believe it!”\n\nShe whirled on him.\n\n“Believe you had anything to do with it? And why not? Where were you that night — that night when I had dared you to go there! She was always hanging after you and poor Bill, and now it’s you or Bill — yes, and me, too, for Corrigan is after blood, right or wrong!”\n\nShe began to wring her hands.\n\n“And it will be the chair for Bill, for he threatened her so often, because she was so crazy about you. And he’s all I have.”\n\n“All you have? How about me, Cora? Ain’t I been true to — “\n\n“True?”\n\nHer voice rose to a rasping scream.\n\n“True? Don’t come here and tell me that! I know how true — I know — Oh, God!” She broke down into weak crying — the crying of a heartbroken child. It seemed the sobs would tear the slender frame to bits as she leaned against the window frame, her face buried in the curtains.\n\nFrank remembered a time when as a boy his little sister had cried so over the death of a pet dog. He could see yet the writhing form of the child as grief was succeeded by horrible convulsions, and he heard even now the terror of his mother’s voice as she demanded who had hurt her darling.\n\nNow Cora was suffering — and he to blame. And she would suffer more if he did not speak.\n\nAwkwardly he advanced to the sobbing girl.\n\nThe handcuffs bothered him, but he must manage somehow.\n\n“Cora!”\n\nHe spoke low, and as gently as ever he had in the days when Cora had first been his “jane.”\n\n“Cora, listen! Don’t cry so. Listen now. Maybe I did go to Westerman’s a bit too much; but you were letting that ivory-topped Louis Michaels stick around here, and I got it straight that you were fixing to give me the go-by — Bill told me so. Bill was there at Westerman’s that night of the killing, but — “\n\n“But what?”\n\nCora’s sobs had stopped, and she peered at Frank’s face in an agony of waiting.\n\n“Why do you want to know so bad what real]y happened?”\n\nFrank bit off the words — his white.\n\n“Why is it so much to you what happened that night? ‘Would you care if I went to the chain? Not much, my girl! I’ve got your number — I’ve had it — think I’ll give up my freedom and my life — for the like of you — why you care as much for me as — “\n\n“No, no, Frank — it’s not that — not that at all. I do love you — but I was mad with jealousy of the Westerman girl — I could have — could have — . But they say Bill killed her, and he’s only a kid, Frank. He’s all I’ve got — your own folks are different, Frank. I can’t see him die for what he didn’t do. He didn’t — didn’t. Can’t you — for me — Frank.”\n\nShe was whispering now — for Corrigan, she well knew, was not asleep.\n\n“Frank, remember, remember those first days we had together? Up in the Bronx, in the little house? You used to say that forever and ever–no matter what happened — you’d love me. Through heaven or hell, you said — we had our heaven — didn’t we, Frank — dear?”\n\nHer arms were about his neck now, and her tear-stained cheek lay just where he could touch it with his lips if he bent his head ever so little.\n\nThe pleading eyes that had once meant the face grown light of the world to him now sought to look into his own evading ones.\n\n“Frank! Don’t you remember?”\n\nThe lips that had not always been so white and drawn reached up seeking comfort.\n\nBlindly he bent down, found the praying mouth, and for a moment or two time rolled back, and it was a summer day with nothing on earth to do but dance while Love piped.\n\nThen he straightened. He threw off the years of mildewing underworld association, and became a mah. He spoke aloud, and clearly:\n\n“A’right, then, Cora! It’s good-by, my girl!”\n\nShe fell bask, white and shaking, but he frowned and shook his head, and went on:\n\n“A’right! We’re quits! Sure I did the Westerman girl. I stayed after Bill went. Fact is, I kicked him out, and she was so damned crybaby about it that we had some words — and you know my temper, Cora. I shoved a gun at her … was one around there — and first I knew she had it right in the heart. And I beat it. Never noticed it was Bill’s gun. Tough luck, a flattie had to lamp me as I was strolling out the door. ‘Sall there is to it. Wish I had a smoke.”\n\nCorrigan stood grinning in the door. He glanced at Cora’s rigid form — like a statue of horror she was.\n\n“Can you beat the dames?” he muttered. “She’s got what she wanted and acts like it was her getting sent up.”\n\nCorrigan started to call his men to take their prisoner back to jail, when with a scream of madness Cora flung herself on Frank. -\n\n“You didn’t do it! Say you didn’t! It means the chair — to end like this! My God! My God!”\n\nWhimpering and clawing at the prisoner, Cora ceased to be a woman, and was only an animal clinging to all she loved on earth.\n\n“Frank, Frank, it must have been Bill — it was, I saw him leave after you — I was watching from across the street. I could not bear for you to be in there with her so long — and while I waited for you to get out of sight, he slipped out of the front door like a thief — or — or a murderer.”\n\nCora whispered the last word, and cowered over Frank’s arm to which she hung with a grip of death.\n\nCorrigan tried to loosen the vise-like fingers; he spoke gently to her, but in vain. Then he lost his temper and said: “Here, what’s the game anyway? If Frank croaked the girl, or Bill did, we gotta get out of here, and stop this flying through the air. I gotta get back and see if they’ve found Bill. Maybe he will have a little confession in his pocket, too. This is a popular case!”\n\nThe whir of the telephone interrupted Corrigan’s sarcasm. He went into the hall to answer it, and did not notice the wizened face of the little old woman peering around the portieres that served as door to the dining-room.\n\nCorrigan seemed put out at the telephone message.\n\n“The deuce you say! What do you know about that, now? Well, I’ll be I’ll tell the world another case like this would drive me batty for fair. And so that’s straight, eh? Oh, signed by a priest as witness, and all? Well, I’ll bring Frank along back. Sure is O. K. then. Yes, I’ll ‘fix that. Sure. Oh, yeh, sure. I’ll be right back, chief. G’by.”\n\nAs he stepped back to the living room With a perplexed frown creasing his brew, the same little old woman laid a hand on his arm.\n\n“Oh, you’re Cora’s maid, eh? Well, what now?”\n\n“If you please, I just want to see you a minute — out back” The old lips were shaking, and the fated blue eyes were wide with something that puzzled Corrigan. He had seen that look in the eyes of men who were about to pay the supreme penalty for crime.\n\n“Well, be quick about what you say — and say it here — I got this man to watch — and this woman, too. I’ll get a stretch up the river myself if any more bobbles are pulled in this case.\n\nThe old woman seemed not to hear him.\n\nShe picked at her quivering lips With one knotty hand, while she held on to Corrigan’s sleeve with the other, as if clinging to any support, in dire peril.\n\n“I’m just tellin’ you — let Cora go — she never done it; nor Frank, nor Bill. I was scared to tell. I thought they’d never put it on Cora, and Bill said they couldn’t hold him — and Frank is so smart — I thought he’d get off. But now you’re holding Cora — and — you don’t mean to let Bill go, either — I can tell! They’ll all get long stretches, and Cora — it’s not right for a girl to go to prison. Me, it don’t matter, but Cora — and Bill — they sh’an’t go. It was for them I did it, anyway. I followed Cora that night, when she -went after Frank. I know she oughtn’t to have carried on like she done with Frank — but she was always spoiled — and Frank’s legal wife was in the asylum — and they were young and in love. After he began running with the Westerman girl Cora was like crazy. She never cared for anything on earth but Frank, and I put up with her rages, and stuck by her, because she needed me, and the people who come here thought I was only her maid because I wouldn’t take even enough of that kind of money to dress decent.\n\n“And then Bill got to running after the Westerman girl, and wild as Bill was, that finished him, for she was bad. ‘ But I’m tellin’ you — “\n\nThe weary old voice was stronger now, and the bent shoulders were erect. Cora was at her side and was trying to silence her, but the older woman threw her back and resolutely kept on:\n\n“That night when Cora followed Frank I slipped out after her, and watched from across the street. I saw Frank come out’ of the Westerman house, and almost right away Bill. Cora went after Frank and I was ready to go, too, when Bill came back and went in. I hurried over, and finding the door not quite closed, I slipped into the hall. They were in the little room old man Westerman used for an office, right off the hall, and I heard every word. The girl was tempting Bill — offering him money if he’d go into some swindling scheme that she was too nice to soil her hands with — and she was planning how, that done, they’d make a get-away with the loot, And she was bad — bad. I couldn’t stand it, and I stepped into-the room and told her what she was — plenty. And she went wild with anger — and — and called me things — and struck at me — like a street woman. So I shot her. I had the gun with me — Cora’s. .And Bill made me swear I’d not tell — he said it would be all right — but it’s not. You can see here where the woman struck and choked me.”\n\nShe pulled aside the scarf she had wound about her neck.\n\n“Maybe I wouldn’t have killed her, but Bill had snatched up a knife from the table when she struck me — and I knew he would do for her if I did not. I’m old — it don’t matter a few years less for me.”\n\nThe old head drooped now. The fire of sacrifice was burned out.\n\nCora had pulled the old woman into a chair, and was sobbing on her shoulder.\n\nThe tears were running down Frank’s face, and Corrigan blew his nose several times while swearing a steady stream.\n\nFinally he said: “Me, I’m off the force for life! This sure has got me for a finish! Not ten minutes ago they telephoned me from headquarters that they got Bill over on Tenth Avenue some place, got him while he was havin’ a little stickin’ party with a buncha wops, and Bill got his — and passed out. And before he does, he does a little confessing, too; says he shot the Westerman girl to save his mother’s life — and as his dope is signed and witnessed — goodnight!”\n\nThe worried Corrigan mopped his brow and thought a bit. Then he went to confer with the men outside.\n\nCora turned to Frank with not a word to say, but a universe of pleading in his eyes.\n\nHe did not speak either, and slowly the invisible chains which bound them tightened and drew them together.\n\n“Well, Cora, girl.”\n\nHis eyes were very tired, and he spoke like a man who has run a long way for a treasure and found nothing at his goal.\n\nCora did not speak for a bit, and then she said:\n\n“You’ll be out by night — can’t we start over — go away — far away?”\n\nHe motioned with his head toward her mother — huddled in a chair, the picture of despairing, lonely sorrow.\n\n“I forgot!”\n\nCora had been forgetting so many years.\n\n“Yes, Cora, you forget her, just as you forgot some other things — and I did, too. Trouble with us has been, we’ve been chasing rainbows — for the pretties at the end. And now we’ve found there ain’t no such thing. All is, now, we got to make the best of it, and not look any more for the Pollyannas in the sky. When she’s clear — they’ll soon free her — we’ll all get out — somewhere.”\n\nCora felt a chill as of Winter come over her, but she tried to throw it off, and clung to Frank in a long kiss as Corrigan entered with the plainclothes men.\n\n“Well, well,” he said cheerfully. “Break away for a bit. Frank will have to go along with me for his walking papers — he’ll be right back. And as for this lady — “\n\nHe paused before the old woman’s chair. She still sat hunched in woe.\n\n“I’d give all I’ve got salted away to have had her keep her mouth shut. But it’s done now–she’ll not get a sentence, even. But I’ll have to take her, I suppose.”\n\nHe gently touched the old arm; looked suddenly at the half-hidden face; turned up to the light the eyes set in eternal peace.\n\n“No, I won’t have to take her. She’s gone on ahead to the Judge.”\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "The guy they’re holding for manslaughter is named John Madden. They’ve got five witnesses who saw him start a ballroom brawl, slug a guy and knock him down. The guy hit his head on the corner of the bar rail when he fell and he died later of a fractured skull.\n\nMadden’s going to be sent up.\n\nHe hasn’t got any defence. He was drinking and he started the brawl, but they know he isn’t the real killer. The real killer is a girl who never saw the dead man in her life and who was ten miles away from the fight when it started.\n\nShe’s a little brunette named Mary Brown, and she forgot to make a telephone call.\n\nMadden — the guy they’re holding — was a salesman, but he’s been out of work for six months and now his wife is going to have a kid. The Maddens have been living on money borrowed from Madden’s life insurance.\n\nWhen he worked, he had the same boss as Mary Brown had, but he got to drinking too much on the job and he was fired. Since then, he’d been trying to get into something steady, without much luck.\n\nYesterday he went back to see his exboss. He told him about the kid on the way and he begged for another chance.\n\nThe boss knows that Madden is a good worker when he’s sober, and good salesmen don’t come a dime a dozen. So he told Madden he’d think it over, and he said he’d call Madden if he decided to put him back on the job.\n\nMadden went home hopeful last night. He was sure he’d get another chance, and he was pretty happy about it. He and his wife were excited, talking about how they’d get things going right again, and how they’d manage better this time on the money he’d be earning. They were both real happy.\n\nThis morning, Madden’s old boss remembered his promise, and he told Mary Brown to call Madden’s home and tell him to report for work.\n\nMary Brown made a note of the phone number on the cover of her notebook. She intended making the call before she started to transcribe her dictation. Before that, though, her boy friend called her. After she had made a date with him she started right in typing letters, without ever thinking of Madden again.\n\nAll this time, remember. Madden was sitting at home. He and his wife were waiting for the phone to ring with the message that would mean a fresh start for both of them.\n\nAt first they were talking and joking a lot, but as the morning wore along without a phone call, the talk died down.\n\nThey ate some lunch and Madden said he wouldn’t leave the house because if he did he might miss the phone call. Mrs. Madden said she hoped it would come soon. It was terrible, she said, to live the way they were living.\n\nMadden blew his top then. He said he was trying every way he knew how to find work, and even if it was all his fault, for God’s sake, he wasn’t the first guy in the world to make a mistake. He wanted to know if she was ever going to quit nagging him about it, and he said he didn’t enjoy the way they were living any more than she did but he wasn’t going to cry about it for the rest of his life. There were some things about his wife, he said, that didn’t suit him too well, but he wasn’t going to cry about them, either.\n\nOne word led to another and they ended up by shouting at each other.\n\nThen Mrs. Madden went into the bathroom to cry and Madden put on his hat. He said to hell with waiting for the phone to ring, and he left the apartment.\n\nHe hadn’t had a drink for about three months, but he got to thinking that neither his wife nor his boss believed in him, and so what good was it to try and make a comeback? He stopped at a bar and got a double whisky. After he had sat around for a while he had another. ‘Hut made him feel better, and he told himself he didn’t give a damn what his wife or his boss thought about him.\n\nHe didn’t go home for dinner. Mrs. Madden waited for him and when he didn’t show up she began to worry about him, fearing that he had started — as he had — to drink again.\n\nAbout eight o’clock that evening, Madden was pretty drunk, and he had no money left to spend. He hated to go home and face his wife, though, because he was beginning to realize what a fool he had made of himself. What started to work on him and make him irritable, looking for a fight — not at all like his usual self.\n\nSomebody at the bar was talking about Senator McCarthy and what a good job he was doing on the Reds. Madden, still sore at the world, said to hell with that stuff, and that started the argument. The guy who liked McCarthy called Madden a dirty subversive and a Commie, and said he ought to be run out of the country.\n\nMadden said: “Well, you might try to make McCarthy run me out of the country, but first I’m going to run you out of this ginmill.”\n\nThen he slugged the guy.\n\nBut Madden didn’t really kill the guy. Mary Brown killed him.\n\nIf Madden had gotten that call, the guy he slugged could have gone on talking about McCarthy all night and neither Madden nor anybody else would have cared. There wouldn’t have been any cops in the barroom to grab Madden for manslaughter if he’d gotten his call.\n\nBut there’s a guy dead and somebody has to be charged. There’s got to be a patsy and that patsy is John Madden.\n\nIt’s a rotten jam and it’s going to wreck three lives.\n\nBut there’s a lawyer arranging bail now. Once you’re out on bail you’re free, until the case comes up. And you might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.\n\nSo when I get out on bail I’m going to find Mary Brown and I’m going to kill her. Me. John Madden.\n\nTHE END\n"

But don’t do it — you’re an actor and a good one, but that doesn’t make you a good detective. Every man to his own trade. Maybe we’ll have some news for you soon — we can’t solve every case.”\n\n“And mine’s one of those you can’t solve, is that it?”\n\n“It’s a tough one —  — you’ve got to admit that. All the information your sister was able to give us was that there were two masked men, one shorter than the other that they grabbed about sixty thousand dollar’s’ worth of jewelry, including a valuable diamond necklace, all insured, and — “\n\nTorrington spoke low and through gritted teeth: “Hell with the jewelry! I’m not thinking of the jewelry. It’s just that scum like that have no right to live!”\n\nTorrington’s mother had died of the shock and the beating administered by the callous thieves who had entered her home during the night; his sister was in the hospital as a result.\n\n“How about the clue that one of them had only four fingers on his left hand? Didn’t that help you any?”\n\nTorrington himself had only four fingers on his right hand — a souvenir of an accident when he was a boy. The inspector’s eyes rested on the hand absently.\n\nHe said, “There’s only one four-fingered crook I know — Nick Trout. He was in the hospital when the crime was committed.”\n\n“Sure of that?”\n\n“Absolutely. That’s where we found him when we went looking, two days after the crime — and he’d been there for two weeks. He’s out now. Hospital records corroborate it; nurses, interns, orderly, all back it up. He was on his back with pneumonia. It’s not his kind of a job anyhow. He goes in mostly for robbing other thieves-finds out when one of them has made a haul and comes down on him — takes it away.”\n\nTorrington stirred, suddenly interested. “When can I see this Nick Trout? I’ve got to see him at once.”\n\nThe inspector studied him fixedly. He said, “Bird dog, hey? We might be able to bring him down here tomorrow morning — say ten o’clock. If he’s still in circulation.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nFour Fingers!\n\nAt ten sharp, John Torrington was there. In the Detective Bureau, Inspector Sheldon introduced Nick Trout, a slender man with an unusually fine complexion and light blue eyes.\n\n“You can use the room next door if you wish to talk privately,” Sheldon suggested.\n\nThey went into the next room.\n\nTrout was puzzled and defiant. He said, “Hey, what’s this all about? Anytime anybody steals anything in this man’s town, the cops run to me to ask questions.”\n\n“Sit down!” Torrington’s tone was brusque. He got a chair for himself and placed it opposite Trout. He said, “Let’s see your left hand!”\n\nSilently Trout extended it.\n\n“Four fingers!” the actor said thoughtfully.\n\nTrout flared up at that. “I know what you mean, Mister! Listen: I was on my back and fightin’ pneumonia when that job was done. Cripes, do I have to get blamed for everything?”\n\nBut he was half-smiling, a look of amusement in those cold blue eyes of his; he met Torrington’s boring glance without flinching.\n\n“Don’t you believe me, Mister?”\n\n“My name is John Torrington. If I didn’t believe you,” — -Torrington’s voice was as cold as the other’s eyes — “I’d strangle you with my bare hands — right here in this room!”\n\nHe glared at Trout; Trout frowned but said nothing.\n\n“Whenever you begin getting an idea this is funny,” the actor gritted, “remember it cost my mother her life!”\n\nAnd the look on Torrington’s face was such that even Trout, hard character though he was, finally turned away.\n\nTrout said, “Let’s get down to cases. What d’ya want me to do?”\n\n“It’s worth ten thousand dollars in cash to me, to find out who the men were that did it!”\n\nThere was no mistaking the greedy gleam in the jewel-thief’s eyes. “Ten grand, hey? How would I know it’s on the level?”\n\n“I’ll give it to you in writing.”Torrington took out a memorandum book, scribbled rapidly, tore out the sheet and handed it to Trout.\n\nTrout read the memo slowly. He slipped it into his pocket. “Okay, Mr. Torrington. If them guys can be got — if they was regulars —  — I’ll get them. Got no use for guys like that anyhow — only a coupla women in the house they didn’t have to get rough.”\n\n“I’m not a welcher, Trout. Now, keep in touch with me. You’ll find me at the Friars almost every night.” He gave Trout the address. “I’m depending on you — I’ll make it worth your while. Play square with me, that’s all I ask.”\n\n“I gotta play square with you … you’re a friend of the inspector’s, aintcha? My flat is at 302 East 116th Street — you see how fast the cops got me when they wanted me.” He went out.\n\nTorrington went into Sheldon’s office and told him what he had done.\n\n“Well” —  — Sheldon looked thoughtful — -“he’s a damn good bird-dog — he might lead you to them all right. Then again — and this is a lot more likely — he won’t. We’ve never been able to get him to sing, and we’ve put the heat on him plenty. Maybe the ten grand might do the trick, but I don’t think so. I think he’ll give you the double-cross — grab the stuff for himself, if he locates it — rather than squeal”\n\nTorrington said slowly, “Glad you told me — I won’t let him out of my sight. He’s starting on the job tomorrow — I’ll stick closer to him than his shadow.”\n\nThe inspector appraised John Torrington’s well-known features and six feet of good-looking masculinity with a quizzical smile. “You couldn’t shadow him for a block without his spotting you!\n\n“And don’t let him kid you about his starting tomorrow — he’s starting tonight! He knows just where to go.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Old Double-Cross\n\nThe inspector was mistaken.\n\nAt seven o’clock in the evening, the shabby-looking elderly man saw Nick Trout enter the house at 302 East 116th Street, and although he waited outside of the house until after midnight Trout did not come out again.\n\nBut the next morning at ten, Trout issued forth, looking as spruce as a salesman in a swell clothing shop. Behind him and on the other side of the street, a fireman in uniform strolled along. Trout went down in the subway, walked across town, and went upstairs in a building on Second Avenue near Seventh Street. He came down, grabbed a cab like a business man in a hurry, and Torrington had a job then to find another cab and follow him quickly enough not to lose him. Trout got out in front of a poolroom on Christopher Street, went inside. He came out almost an hour later.\n\nTorrington caught sight of him at once, and followed him to the subway. Trout got off at the Fulton Street station, and walked straight to a building in the jewelry district on John Street. Torrington followed him to the second floor, and lingered on the stairs, watching as Trout paused in front of one door and studied it. Trout hesitated, turned and threw a quick look at Torrington, who seemed to be on his way upstairs. Then, without going in, Trout descended to the street again.\n\nAn hour later came the disappointment. Trout entered a hotel — and disappeared! Torrington waited for two hours; during that time he wandered through the hotel lobby half a dozen times, and finally discovered the door on the side street, through which Trout must have exited unseen.\n\nTrout did not go home that night, and his door was still locked the following morning at seven, when John knocked. Baffled then, the actor called Inspector Sheldon on the telephone, and Sheldon sent out his emissary to bring Nick in. The officer came back with the report that no one in the neighborhood, and none of Nick’s intimates, knew where he had gone.\n\n“I told you he’d give you the old double-cross,” Sheldon said cynically. “They just don’t squeal — it isn’t safe. Not even for a super-thief like Nick Trout, who preys on lesser thieves. They hate a squealer!”\n\nTorrington thought of the office door on the second floor of the house on John Street, at which Trout had gazed with so much interest. He went back to his apartment and changed his costume. It required every bit of skill John possessed — it was one thing to dress up and fix up to appear on the stage, and quite another to make up for the street, where his disguise would have to stand the light of day.\n\nBut he got through, finally, and went to John Street by subway. He climbed two flights of stairs and stood in front of the door that had attracted Nick Trout. The name on it was “Prentice &amp;amp; Co.” Under it was the inscription, “Diamonds and Precious Stones.”\n\nHe went downstairs to look it up, but there was no “Prentice &amp;amp; Co.” in the telephone book. A new firm?\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Jeweler\n\nThe man inside the one-room office cast a quick look at the farmer standing on the threshold, and rose from the chair on which he had been lounging with an open lack of enthusiasm, and a curt, “Well — what can I do for you?”\n\n“Dunno! Mebbe you kin do something, mebbe not! All depends!” The farmer stared at the jeweler, noted particularly his hands. There were the usual five fingers on each.\n\n“Oh, it all depends! Well, what is it that depends — what can I do for you, Silas?” The jeweler’s frown of annoyance changed suddenly into a grin. He said, “I’m not the guy who sold you the Brooklyn Bridge, Si — that was another guy named Elmer.”\n\nImpassively the visitor took a step inside and closed the door behind him. He scratched a hairy neck with a dirty finger, and squinted through his spectacles. “Beats me,” he murmured, “what makes you city slickers think you’re so durned smart!”\n\n“Okay, okay — no offense!” The jeweler sat down again.\n\n“Nobody ain’t sold me no bridge and no city hall, Mister — I know my way about.”\n\n“I’ll bet you do — -I’ll bet you’ve seen all the sights, too — and that’s more than I’ve done. How do you like this town, pal?”\n\n“You couldn’t sell it to me for a dime! Say, have you got a diamond ring for a bargain? This size?” He held out a piece of string.\n\nPrentice took it from him. “For your wife or your sweetie?”\n\n“For my wife. Looka here, Mister — I won’t be intrested in nothin’ that ain’t real handsome. When I got married — Goshamighty, it rained cats and dogs — and I had to borrer five dollars for to buy a plain gold band. Yes siree — and couldn’t pay it back for nigh two years! Wal — now that I kin afford it, I’m flggerin’ some of that oil comin’ outa my farm oughta pay for a surprise for Lucy! Yes siree! I might buy two rings — pervidin’ you’ll sell them at a bargain.”\n\nThe gray eyes behind the spectacles read the self — condemnation the jeweler was heaping on himself as he came forward.\n\nThe jeweler asked, “What did you say your name was?”\n\n“I didn’t say — yit! Don’t matter anyhow — money talks, I reckon! Name’s Bunting —  — Ed Bunting!”\n\n“Mine is Prentice,” said the jeweler quietly. He extended his hand, and after a moment’s hesitation, the farmer took it. “To tell you the truth, Mr. Bunting, I feel a little ashamed of myself-took you for just an ordinary dirt farmer.”\n\n“Jest what I am.”\n\n“A man who feels the way you do about his wife … no, sir … if you’re an ordinary farmer, what must the unusual farmers be like? Don’t blame you for feeling the way you do about Mrs. Bunting. When you didn’t have it, she didn’t make any complaint, I’ll bet. All the more reason to be generous with her when you can afford it.”\n\n“Reckon that’s puttin’ into words jest how I feel.” Bunting permitted his antagonism to evaporate under the jeweler’s sincere admiration. “We ain’t had no easy times, Lucy and me — dry spells that burnt up the crops, and wet ones that drowned ‘em — and dust storms. Say, you city folks don’t know how easy you got it! Wal — reckon I’ll look at a few rings now.”\n\nSilently Prentice took off his glasses and wiped them with an air. Then, with reverence, he took a blue plush box out of the small safe in the office.\n\n“Here’s a beauty! Three carats — a flawless blue diamond — platinum setting — there’s real class! Here, take a peep through this magnifying glass!\n\nIt you find a flaw, you can have it for nothing. No yellow in that one — not a streak. Blue diamonds like this one are the kind the Four Hundred wear.”\n\nThe farmer examined the ring without much enthusiasm. It was not part of the loot taken from the Torrington home.\n\n“Don’t give a durn about no Four Hundred — it’s what Lucy likes,” he grumbled.\n\n“Well, she’ll like this one, all right. It’s the right size, too.”\n\nThe prospective customer verified the measurement himself. “Seems like it’s the right size,” he admitted grudgingly. “How much?”\n\n“Eight hundred and twenty-five dollars! It cost me eight hundred — all I’m making is twenty-five dollars!”\n\n“Give ye six hundred!”\n\n“Eight hundred!”\n\n“Six fifty — won’t give ye a dollar. more’n that!”\n\n“Seven hundred — take it or leave it! I’m losing money on it.”\n\nThe farmer said, “I’ll take it — don’t think I don’t know you’re robbin’ me. But the durned thing does look right handsome. You want check or cash?”\n\n“Well now” — -Prentice’s smile was deprecatory — “this being our first transaction — and after all, I don’t know you . . .”\n\n“That’s all right — don’t make no difi’rence to me.”\n\nBunting drew forth a large, greenish-black wallet, shabby but well filled., Prentice’s eyes glittered at sight of it.\n\n“Here you are — seven hundred dollars!”\n\nThe farmer put the money into Prentice’s hand, returned the wallet to his inside pocket, and dropped the plush box into a side pocket. He buttoned his coat and started for the door. “Reckon I’ll look ‘round a little —  — ain’t a-goin’ home with jest one ring — no, sir. Now I’m started, I’m aimin’ to bring Lucy a handful of them gewgaws to play ‘round with.”\n\nPrentice swallowed and drew a long breath.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nA Necklace Like That\n\n“What’s your hurry, Mr. Bunting? Sit down — here, have a smoke.” He handed the farmer a cigar; the farmer put it to his nose, then said, “Thank ye,” as Prentice lighted it for him. “I should have known you’re the kind of man who has the money and doesn’t care about appearances,” Prentice said.\n\nThe farmer sat down. Probably a waste of time, he thought; there was no basis on which to believe that this jeweler knew anything about the Torrington crime except that Nick Trout had been interested in the sign on the door. The ring he had just bought was not worth the money; he had overpaid. However …\n\n“Ain’t got no million dollars, and don’t go thinkin’ it,” the farmer stated. “What I got I aim to hold on to.”\n\n“Of course, of course. But take that ring, as an example: you could convert it into cash any time you had a mind to. Listen: I’ve got something I want to show you — mind, I don’t want to sell it to you — I want to show it to you — that’s all! I have it at home. A diamond necklace that will make you dizzy just looking at it!”\n\nThe farmer was dizzy, all right. It took all his artistry to suppress the surge of excitement, hatred, eagerness, that swept him. He succeeded in looking only mildly interested.\n\n“I allus thought necklaces was made outa pearls,” he said.\n\n“Oh, there are pearl necklaces, and there are diamond necklaces. But no one buys pearls who can afford diamonds. Now this necklace I’m talking about — my own wife is wearing it — being in the business, you can believe that I’m giving her only what’s real classy. Of course, that necklace costs money.”\n\n“I was thinkin’ of rings,” Bunting protested.\n\n“Aw, rings! Everybody has rings in your neck of the country — I’ll bet on it. But who do you know owns a diamond necklace? Another thing: you can always get your money back on a buy like that.”\n\n“Full amount — not the full amount?”\n\n“Oh no, not the whole amount — but pretty near it. A necklace like that is like an investment. Anyhow, I’m not asking you to buy it — just want you to see it. Give you something to talk about when you get back home.”\n\nPrentice fell into a reverie, and the farmer waited.\n\n“Tell you what” — Prentice roused — “you come home with me and fill up on some real home cooking. Let’s go now — the hell with business — let’s get acquainted.”\n\nIndecisively Bunting scratched his neck — scratching his neck seemed to stimulate his mental processes. “Wal, I dunno — “\n\n“Now, now — I won’t take no for an answer. If I were visiting your town and happened to run into you, would you let me get away without at least one visit? Wait here a minute — I’ve got to go down the hall to tell a man something.”\n\nHe went out, and Torrington began to wonder what crooked, devious scheme the jeweler was hatching. It might all be on the up and up, and even if it were an attempt to swindle a too-trusting farmer, there might be no connection with the Torrington robbery.\n\nSomehow, however, Torrington sensed danger. This was a small office, Prentice had seen a well-filled wallet, and he seemed to be a pretty smooth article. If the necklace he wanted to show\n\nTorrington was the one which had belonged to Torrington’s mother, then Prentice was either one of the murderers, or a fence. Murder may become a habit. He was going to Prentice’s home … a micky finn, a blow from a blackjack, even a bullet, were all little contingencies not to be dismissed from consideration. Prentice might feel that it was unnecessary to trade jewelry for money when he could have both.\n\nOf course, it was quite possible the necklace might not be the one. Nevertheless, Torrington stepped to the telephone and dialed Police Headquarters. Sheldon was out, but he talked to an assistant in Sheldon’s office.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nMrs. Prentice and the Maid\n\nThe Prentices lived in a furnished apartment on the ground floor of a house in West 91st Street. Apparently Prentice had telephoned they were coming. A shapely blonde maid opened the door, and in the living room, Mrs. Prentice greeted Bunting effusively.\n\n“Why, Mr. Bunting — you’re not giving us any trouble at all. I’m the one that’s obliged to you — for bringing my husband home so early. And anyhow — anyone coming from a farm — my dad was a farmer, you know.”\n\nShe was a female benison as she hovered over Prentice, her large, calcimined face exuding hospitality, her greenish-brown eyes literally beaming. No make-believe beam, either, reflected Torrington. The thought of that wallet made her amiability both spontaneous and real.\n\nThe maid brought cocktails, and then Prentice disappeared for a few minutes. He came back with the necklace.\n\nHe said, “There it is, Bunting — what do you think of it?” And held it up.\n\nIt would have surprised him to know that his guest knew more about that necklace than he did. It would have surprised him if he could have read Torrington’s mind that instant, and seen the red rage that swept the actor’s brain, that curved his fingers into claws which literally itched to grip the jeweler’s throat.\n\nBut looking at the farmer, Prentice saw nothing unusual.\n\nAfter he had given his prospective customer a chance to see the necklace, Prentice dropped it carelessly into his pocket. He said, “We’ll look at it some more later — let’s see what Clara’s got for us.”\n\nThey sat down at the table, and the blonde maid brought in the fruit cocktail. There was something about that blonde maid which attracted Torrington’s eye, and watching him as his eyes followed her, Prentice winked at his wife.\n\nWhen the soup came, Bunting hitched his chair forward, arranged his napkin under his chin, and picked up the wrong spoon.\n\nWatching covertly, the actor saw Prentice cast a droll look at his mate — and stare in surprise. Torrington’s glance flashed to Mrs. Prentice. She was staring at him, and the blood left her face, leaving it mottled. Torrington could not understand what had frightened her.\n\nShe was looking at his hands; Prentice’s gaze followed his wife’s.\n\nThen Torrington realized. What a fool he’d been! His hands were smooth and white, certainly not the hands of a farmer. He had forgotten about them in making up.\n\nBut his swift glance at Prentice, at the panic in the jeweler’s face, told him something else — something that flashed through his mind with the recollection that Nick Trout had only four fingers on one hand — his left hand, to be sure, whereas Torrington’s four fingers were on his right hand. But these crooks might be thinking he was Nick Trout — Trout had a reputation — not many knew him personally, but every crook had heard of him, according to Inspector Sheldon.\n\nThey thought he was Nick Trout!\n\nSomething was impending; Torrington could tell by the sudden stillness. Poor actors, both these crooks — they couldn’t hide their fear. Clara Prentice’s face had become alrnost green under her paint.\n\nPrentice rose and the farmer looked up alertly. Prentice managed a smile, a poor attempt. He said, “Excuse me — I’ll get a couple of cigars.”\n\n“Cigars with the entree?” Torrington put down his spoon, grinned broadly, spoke normally. “You shouldn’t — it isn’t being done in the best circles, Prentice. But I don’t think you’re going after Cigars — I’ve got a notion you’re going for a gun!”\n\nHis hand darted into his pocket; when it appeared, a black muzzle pointed at Prentice. Without even waiting to be told, Prentice raised both hands high.\n\n“Attaboy!” approved the actor. “Sit down — and keep your hands on the table. You too, Mrs. Prentice — if you please!”\n\nShe obeyed. Then he saw it! A finger was missing from her left hand! The short robber who had broken into the Torrington home that terrible night! Mrs. Prentice in male attire!\n\nTorrington looked at her with hatred. He gritted, “You must look wonderful in men’s clothes, you fat beauty!”\n\n“Listen — listen, Nick — I’ll give you the necklace,” Prentice chattered. “It’s in my pocket — you can have it!”\n\nHe was sure Torrington was Nick Trout. Evidently he had heard of the super-thief, but had never seen him. The actor glared at him.\n\nA subtle expectancy in the attitude of the precious couple puzzled Torrington. Some sixth sense warned him of danger.\n\nHe watched them narrowly.\n\nThen a voice behind him ordered sharply, “Drop that rod — -put your hands up!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nDouble-Crosser\n\nTorrington dared a swift glance over his shoulder. There stood the maid, two feet away, pointing a gun at him. She could not possibly miss. He dropped his weapon and elevated his hands.\n\nStupid of him. Anybody working in an establishment of thieves like this one was worth watching. He had completely overlooked danger from the blonde maid. That one glance told him that she was dressed for the street and the look in her light blue eyes convinced him that she could not be trifled with.\n\n“Step to your right!” she commanded curtly. “Move — move!”\n\nHe obeyed, and she walked over and picked his weapon from the floor. Then she turned her attention to Prentice.\n\n“Get out that necklace and put it on the table!”\n\nApparently the order astonished him, but he obeyed promptly. She took the necklace and thrust it into her blouse.\n\n“Now be good everybody — -stay right where you are! Anybody let’s out a yip is asking for the undertaker!”\n\nMrs. Prentice shrieked suddenly, “Betty — wait for us! We’ll go along with you!” And she made one impetuous step, overturning a chair in her haste.\n\nThe look in the maid’s eyes became feral and deadly. “You stay where you are, you fat fool! And don’t do that again unless you’re tired of living. I’d just as lief put a slug in you as not!”\n\nThe ingratitude and disloyalty made Mrs. Prentice jump. She cried out, “You double-crosser! You — “\n\nBetty took one long stride toward her, and instantly Mrs. Prentice froze into frightened silence.\n\nBetty asked, low, “What did you say?” and waited, her finger crooked on the trigger. “Open your mug once more and I’ll blast it!”\n\nSlowly she moved backward toward the door, she cautioned ominously, “the first one pokes his nose outa that door gets a chunk of lead!”\n\nReaching behind her, she turned the knob, stepped back and vanished, closing the door softly.\n\nAt once Prentice started after her. He paused and asked Torrington, “You aren’t gonna let her get away, are you, Nick?”\n\nHe rushed toward the door without waiting for a reply.\n\nWith two long bounds the actor overtook him. He smashed Prentice to the floor with a solid punch.\n\nSlowly Prentice sat up. He seemed dazed. Through bleeding lips he protested, “You got any idea what that necklace is worth, Nick? I wanted to get it and split with you. Maybe we can still catch her!”\n\n“Don’t worry about her,” said Torrington. “I’m not Nick Trout, you swine.”\n\n“You aren’t?” The crook’s bloody face held a bewildered expression. “I thought you were Four-finger Nick. What are you — a dick?”\n\nThere was a banging on the door; then it opened wide. Betty came in. Behind her was the propelling power of a strong — armed plainclothesman; behind him came two others. Betty’s blond wig was awry, disclosing a shock of brown hair, darker in color than the wig.\n\nOne of the officers explained, “She tried to pull a gat, Mr. Torrington, so we had to muss her up a bit. Only she isn’t a ‘she’ — she’s a ‘he’!”\n\nTorrington stared at the maid. “Nick Trout! You damned weasel!” He growled, “What a female impersonator!”\n\nNick said pridefully, “Say, didja think you were the only good actor in this town, Torrington?” He added, “You never thought I could put on an act like that, did you? Know when I got wise you was following me? I saw you on the stairs in that John Street building — that fireman’s uniform didn’t fool me for a minit. But I fooled you, didn’t I?”\n\nOne of the officers put handcuffs on him.\n\nTorrington took off his spectacles and walked over to Prentice. He said, “I’ll take that seven hundred I gave you for the ring — and here’s your ring.”\n\n“Nothing doing — got to leave everything as is.” A detective interposed between them.\n\nPrentice said, “It’s his money — I’m willing to give it to him.”\n\n“Can’t allow it,” the detective insisted. He looked quizzically at Torrington. “Pretty good disguise, all right. Takes an actor.”\n\n“Didn’t fool me,” Trout bragged. “I knew who he was as soon as he came in.”\n\n“You didn’t, did you?” Torrington’s grim glance rested on Prentice. “I’m John Torrington, the man whose mother you murdered, you murderous rat!”\n\n“Take it easy, Mr. Torrington,” a detective said soothingly. Another put a detaining hand on Torrington’s shoulder.\n\nPrentice wilted, shrank back. He said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”\n\n“Oh, yes you do,” Trout broke in unexpectedly. “Heard you two shootin’ your mouths off about it.” His voice rose to a very creditable falsetto. “You shouldn’t talk secrets in front of your help.”\n\nThe jeweler glared bitterly at his wife. “You sure pick your maids good, don’t you?”\n\n“Like you pick your guests,” she shrilled back at him.\n\nNick stood there grinning malevolently at them. He didn’t have their reason for worrying. All he could be accused of was trying to rob a couple of other crooks — and he might beat the rap by turning state’s evidence.\n\nTHE END\n"

So far, so good. That’s straightforward enough. But, confound it,” he went on, “when you all tell me you heard a report like a pistol shot, you introduce a crazy element. A knife doesn’t go off with a bang!”\n\n“Nevertheless,” said Malo suavely, “there was a bang. Wasn’t there?”\n\nThe question was addressed to his four companions — three men and a woman — who were seated around Gray’s desk.\n\nGray stared at the visitors, as though despairing of understanding them.\n\nTwo of them were tall lean fellows, with slightly stooping shoulders and pale faces, and the other was a medium-sized man, rather older than the others, noteworthy for a pair of large, dark eyes, which surveyed Gray with sympathetic concern.\n\nThe inspector felt an urge to shout at this man, whose name was Ivor Vilnikoff, and who was understood to be the husband of the extremely attractive woman who sat by his side.\n\nThen he regained his self-control and surveyed the company almost apologetically.\n\n“There is no knife,” he said quietly. “Keepers and police were on the spot immediately, and you all submitted to a search. Moreover, nobody could possibly have got away, nor remained in hiding, and the ground was searched very carefully. But there was no knife. Just think of it! What on earth is it all about? There’s the sound of a pistol shot, and the victim receives a gash in the neck such as could only have been inflicted with a large, razor-edged knife. The surgeon says the wound is such that the blade must have been at least ten or twelve inches long. Well, where is it?”\n\n“You’ve had the ground dug over?” asked Malo.\n\n“Yes. I’m quite satisfied in my mind that there is no knife there.”\n\n“It’s very queer,” said Malo, “particularly in view of that strange phobia which poor Mather had about gardens.”\n\nGray showed signs of returning impatience.\n\n“That,” he said, “may be intriguing to a literary man like yourself, Mr. Malo, but it isn’t very interesting to a police officer. Most of us have a mild phobia of some kind. But perhaps it is rather remarkable that this man should have had a life-long dread of quiet gardens. I dare say a psychologist could easily explain it, but that wouldn’t help me to solve the mystery of his death.” This last remark seemed to set him off on a new line of reflection.\n\n“Perhaps,” he said presently, “it wouldn’t be such a bad idea. I think I can get hold of a gentleman right away who has devoted much time to the study of the psychological aspect of crime — Mr. Dixon Hawke. No doubt you’ve heard of him. He’s a friend of mine, and I’d like him to hear your story.”\n\nHe picked up the telephone from his desk and dialled a number.\n\n“Hawke,” he announced, after a brief conversation, “is coming over here right away.”\n\nTen minutes later Malo was repeating his story to the visitor from Dover Street, who had arrived in company with his young assistant, Tommy Burke.\n\n“This man, Wilson Mather,” said the poet, “was a playwright.\n\n“He had repeatedly told us about a constantly recurring dream, in which he found himself walking in a vast garden filled with ornamental trees. He was alone in this dream of his, and the silence was absolute. Some horrible menace seemed always to be waiting him behind the next group of shrubbery, or the next tree.”\n\n“So somebody suggested that the best way of ridding himself of this troublesome obsession was to visit some such place as was depicted in the dream — preferably in congenial company.”\n\n“And you straight away thought of Kew Gardens?”\n\n“Naturally. That was the place that seemed to fit the bill.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Quarrelsome Couple\n\nGray passed the criminologist a photograph of an arborial group, which included two poplars and an ash tree.\n\n“This is where Mather fell,” he remarked, indicating a pencilled cross near the ash.\n\n“And,” said Malo, “that’s exactly the sort of spot that Mather described as dominating his dream. Strange, isn’t it?”\n\n“Yes,” said Hawke. “Very.”\n\n“I don’t know whether you’d care to go to Kew and have a look at the scene for yourself,” put in Gray.\n\nHawke answered quickly.\n\n“I think not. You’ve had the place searched since the crime was committed last night?”\n\n“Yes. It happened just before dusk, and when they were about to close the gardens. These people were the only members of the public anywhere near that spot. They — er — understand their position in the matter.”\n\n“Of course,” said Vilnikoff, “we are suspect. I take it that we can expect to be under observation until this is cleared up?”\n\n“I’m sure Mr. Gray won’t find that necessary,” said Hawke. “There are a great many crimes which, unfortunately, have to go unsolved. Everything has been done that can be done, and there is nothing for it but to pigeonhole the matter until there is some further development. Isn’t that so, Gray?”\n\nThe Dover Street man spoke genially and lightly, but the inspector sensed that there was subtlety in this, and promptly gave the answer that seemed to be expected of him.\n\n“Yes, you’re right there. I don’t see what more we can do in the matter. I have a couple of plain-clothes men at Kew Gardens now, but they’ll have to be taken off, I’m afraid.”\n\n“Do you mean,” asked Malo in surprise, “that you are content to leave it as an unsolved crime?”\n\n“We are decidedly not content,” answered Gray, “and if there is any further little detail which occurs to any of you people, at any time, please get in touch with us.”\n\nWhen the little company left a few minutes later, they looked as though they were far from impressed with the efficiency and intelligence of the police.\n\n“Well, Hawke,” said Gray, after they had gone. “What next?”\n\n“Have you got to know all about those people?”\n\n“Malo’s a poet; the two tall ones, Drewitt and Smith, are artists; Vilnikoff does a little bit of sculpture, and Mrs. Vilnikoff’s an actress.”\n\n“And their relations with the dead man?”\n\n“That I don’t know a great deal about. I believe Wilson Mather was very friendly with Vilnikoff’s wife, but, then, so are the rest of them. You never know where you are with a bohemian crowd like that.”\n\nHawke paced the carpet with his hands interlocked behind Ills back.\n\n“Those two fellows Drewitt and Smith didn’t have very much to say for themselves, did they?” he remarked.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Nor did the lady. She’s English, isn’t she?”\n\n“Yes. Norah Daley is her stage name. Also her maiden name.”\n\n“Married to a Russian! A sculptor! Has he always been a sculptor?”\n\n“I understand he’s been all sorts of things. He was in a circus at one time, though I don’t know what his line was.\n\nAfter Hawke had copied a list of the names and addresses of the five people who had just left, he and Tommy returned to Dover Street.\n\n“More data is required,” he said, after they had arrived back at the flat. “See what you can do about it, will you? Here are the addresses. You might glean something from people in the vicinity.\n\n“Keep the Vilnikoffs in mind for a start. Follow up any line of inquiry that suggests itself as you go along. Use your initiative. I can’t give the matter any more of my attention at the moment. There’s a lot of correspondence to be attended to.”\n\n“OK, sir. I’ll do my best. See you later.”\n\nHawke had cleared up the correspondence and set his typist to work when Tommy returned.\n\nThe youth did not consider that he had discovered anything of startling importance, but, nevertheless, the message he brought was sufficient to increase his employer’s interest in the Vilnikoffs.\n\n“I can’t help feeling that there is something to be learned from those two,” said the detective. “You say they are known to quarrel at times — violently?”\n\n“Yes. They live on the third floor of a big block of flats just off Tottenham Court Road. There is a newspaper man living in the adjoining flat whom I know slightly, and he told me that Vilnikoff had been known to set about her with a whip. At other tunes they are like a couple of love-birds.”\n\n“They sound an interesting couple,” said Hawke. “I think I’ll go and call on them.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nIn Cossack Costume\n\nIt was after dark when Hawke arrived outside the block of flats, and standing near a street lamp where he had a clear view of the entrance was a Scotland Yard man whom he recognised.\n\n“I take it,” he said, “you’re watching for the Vilnikoffs?”\n\n“Yes, Mr. Hawke. Tedious job it is, too. They’re both in. Came home about an hour ago.”\n\nThis chance conversation proved of considerable importance, for when Hawke presented himself at the flat he found Mrs. Vilnikoff alone.\n\n“I don’t know where Ivor’s gone,” she said, “nor how long he’ll be, and I don’t care.”\n\nHawke found this interesting.\n\n“Has he been gone long?”\n\n“About ten minutes. He’s got one of his fits of bad temper. Does this black eye show much?”\n\n“No,” reassured Hawke.\n\n“I usually find that face-powder turns a black eye green.”\n\nIn these disconcerting circumstances Hawke would normally have excused himself and departed immediately, but he was curious to get a look at the contents of the flat, and so he accepted the woman’s invitation to a glass of wine.\n\nThe main living apartment seemed to reflect the clashing of temperaments, and the pictures on the wall showed similar violent contrasts of taste. Etchings clashed with photographic groups and tinted portraits.\n\nOne of the latter depicted Vilnikoff attired in Cossack dress and holding a leather whip.\n\nThe woman saw Hawke looking at it. “Sometimes he seems to think he’s still a circus performer,” she said, “and that I’m an unbroken horse.”\n\nDuring the ensuing conversation, Hawke’s mind was busy.\n\nThe chance talk with the detective outside had disclosed the fact that Vilnikoff had not left by the front entrance. Why not? How had he left? By the back way, of course. And for a building in this particular situation, that was decidedly unusual.\n\n“We’ve been talking about Mather,” said the woman presently, “and Drewitt says he thinks the wound may have been caused by a vulture or an eagle or something. You do hear of these things escaping from aviaries, he says. He thinks the bird could have swooped down and up again amongst the trees without our noticing it. And he thinks that report might have been caused by one of the bird’s wings smacking Mather across the back.”\n\nHawke stared.\n\n“It’s an ingenious explanation,” he said. “Mr. Drewitt appears to be a very considerable thinker. Are there any other interesting things he’s been thinking?”\n\n“Yes. He thinks the police are a lot of fools. And he thinks the same about you. My husband doesn’t, though. My husband thinks you could unravel the mystery if you gave your mind to it.”\n\n“And perhaps,” replied Hawke, “I will give my mind to it. Meanwhile, I must be off.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Concealed Knout\n\nOutside the building Hawke hailed a taxi.\n\n“Drive me to Kew Gardens,” he instructed the driver.\n\nIt was whilst inspecting that picture of Vilnikoff in his Cossack uniform that the detective had suddenly recalled the photograph which Gray had shown him, and now, in his mind’s eye, he had a vivid picture of the ash, with its thin branches trailing down to the ground.\n\nHawke dismissed the taxi at Kew Bridge and walked for about twenty minutes until he came to a secluded spot where it was possible for him to scale the high railings unobserved.\n\nThis accomplished, he made his way in the direction of the spot where Mather had met his death. The newspaper accounts of the affair had given him a fairly accurate idea of its location, for he knew the gardens quite well.\n\nIn a few minutes Hawke reached the ash, around which was an extensive area of newly-dug and sifted soil, covered with footprints, and, after a cautious look round, he plunged in amongst its curtain of drooping branches.\n\nThe ground at the base of the tree had been carefully turned over, and possible hiding-places for a knife had been sought for in this and other nearby trees, but Hawke was not looking for a knife. He was examining the branches, one by one.\n\nHe gripped them and tugged at them gently, and presently his fingers closed round one which yielded to his pull.\n\nHe uttered an involuntary grunt of satisfaction as he tugged this smooth, rope-like “branch “ down from the tree.\n\nIt was not a branch at all, for it was made of leather and was an object which achieved notoriety as an instrument of torture in Russia many years ago. It was known as a knout.\n\nThis particular knout was representative of its kind, being some twenty feet in length. It was smooth, pliable, gradually-tapering leather for the greater part of its length, but about eighteen inches from its tip, it was hardened and flattened, having been pressed out to form two knife-like edges.\n\nHawke was examining his find, partly concealed beneath the branches, when, for some reason, which he could not accurately define, he found himself suddenly, startlingly alert.\n\nHe sensed some other presence.\n\nThe stock end of the knout was lying on the ground, and the detective was holding the tip of it in his hands, when suddenly it was wrenched away, cutting his fingers.\n\nSomeone who had been standing very close to him had seized the stock, and taken possession of the knout.\n\nHawke thrust aside the branches and came out into the open.\n\nA most fortunate thing occurred as he did so.\n\nA stray branch swung back and pushed his felt hat over his eyes, and an instant later he received a terrible, stinging blow across the forehead.\n\nHe felt the sting of it even through the felt and the leather hand inside the hat. Hawke knew he had received a blow from the knout.\n\nPushing the hat back to its proper position, he beheld a crouching figure a few yards distant, actually in the process of raising his arm to take another crack at him.\n\nHawke turned and ran. He knew by this time, exactly in what capacity Vilnikoff had earned his living in the circus.\n\nVilnikoff was running, too.\n\nHis secret was out — unless he could manage to give Kew Gardens one more mysterious tragedy.\n\nHawke realised that his only chance was to get into a confined space where the Russian would not have a chance of wielding the knout. Then he might find an opportunity of getting him at close quarters.\n\nAccordingly, he sprinted in the direction of one of the vast hot-houses, and reaching it, ran in between one of its sides and a brick wall.\n\nHere Vilnikoff made a mistake. He rushed in after the detective, and was met with a punch on the jaw which sent him reeling, and he crashed to the ground unconscious.\n\nA few moments later a uniformed night watchman was on the scene.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nA Jealous Husband\n\nVilnikoff afterwards became resigned to his fate and admitted that it was jealousy of Mather’s attachment for his wife that had caused him to kill Mather.\n\n“It was the one way in which I was really competent to kill him,” ho told the police, “and it was such an unusual way that I stood every chance of escaping detection. But I wanted the right opportunity, and space in which to wield the knout.\n\n“The opportunity came when the visit to Kew Gardens was suggested. It was I who suggested it, though nobody seemed to recall that fact when the inquiries were being made.\n\n“There was something about the idea of justifying Mather’s tree phobia for him which appealed to my sense of the dramatic. The knout was one which I used in my circus days. I coiled it round my waist, and took it to Kew concealed beneath my waistcoat. We spread out as we strolled aimlessly along. I dropped behind Mather, and the others went ahead.\n\n“My opportunity came at an excellent moment. We were just passing that ash, and after I had made effective use of the knout I stepped in among the branches and threw the stock end over a high fork, so that the lash draped down on either side, unnoticeable, except as one of the branches.\n\n“The police, of course, were looking for a knife. I didn’t think it would occur to them to look for a whip — and I was very nearly right.”\n\n~THE END~\n"

      "content_html": "This is a sweet little swindle, and for a long tithe was a splendid revenue to the men who started it. Gradually more and more of the get-rich-quick gentry heard about it, and the field became overcrowded. But unlike many similar rackets, it has not been done to death, and is lying fallow until the advent of an administration that isn’t so hard on the smart boys.\n\nLet us say you are in the candy business –your advertisement appears in the papers. You receive a letter or a postal-card from Smith &amp;amp; Jones, Resident Buyers, requesting you to call and bring samples of your commodity.\n\nYou call at the time specified, and are ushered into.an office where a curt, businesslike individual listens to your story and gradually unbends as you explain the good points of your product. After a while, the man behind the desk becomes quite cordial and friendly. He tells you to leave your samples, and he’ll call you after he has had an opportunity to examine them. Incidentally, he explains that his firm does the buying for thousands of stores in the South and Middle West — some in the farther West, too.\n\nWhen you leave his presence, a warm, optimistic feeling permeates you. You have found the outlet you were looking for. This firm of resident buyers, for a reasonable commission that is half of what you pay a salesman, will represent you all over the country.\n\nFine so far.\n\nIn a few days along comes the letter you expect. Your merchandise is quite good — in fact the writer likes it and wishes to talk to you about it if you will call at such and such a time.\n\nPromptly on the minute you present yourself, trying not to beam. Yes, Mr. Jones, of Smith &amp;amp; Jones, to whom your goods were shown, thinks they’re just what the firm has been looking for. They’re going in to exploit them heavily for you. All they want is their commission on any merchandise they sell.\n\nOh yes — there’s going to be the postage on the twenty-five or fifty thousand letters they’re going to send out to all their correspondents, with your prospectus in it. They send out their letters by first-class mail — about two hundred dollars will cover it. And you’ll be kind enough to send Smith &amp;amp; Jones enough circulars so there won’t be any delay.\n\nYou come across with that two hundred dollars — and you might as well kiss it goodby. Your circulars are sent out, it’s true! Post Office inspectors can’t be treated lightly — they’ll come around, and ask questions if a complaint is made.\n\nBut your circulars and the circulars of half a dozen other dupes like yourself are put into one envelope — and sent as printed matter — cheap, oh so cheap. There is a nice little profit on the transaction for Smith &amp;amp; Jones, and where is your kick? You say the two hundred was to cover first-class mail? It’s your word against the word of Smith &amp;amp; Jones.\n\nIt was mailed to the stores in the South and Middle West — and farther West, too. They have the list, and inquiry of any of the names will confirm their statement — if the recipients of the circulars happen to remember.\n\nYes, once in a blue moon you may even receive an inquiry from one of the stores. Manna once came down from heaven, too.\n\nTHE END\n"

Gammage\n  The Old Orchid Hunter’s Fear\n  Out of the Swamp\n  Murderer!\n  You’re In the Wrong Seat\n  All About the Murder of …\n  A Little — Unpleasantness\n  The Disappearance of De Collyer\n  Macbeth Hath Murdered Sleep\n  Reflected In the Mirror\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nReflection\n\nDe Collyer grimaced slightly at his reflection in the long pier-glass as he applied the rabbit’s foot to his eyebrows in a final, deft movement. If it is true that nine-tenths of the actor’s art is comprehended in the knowledge of make-up, De Collyer was an artist to his fingertips — long, sensitive, slender — the fingers of a man with imagination — and something more.\n\nDe Collyer, or it was the face in the mirror, mouthed an unintelligible guttural in a voice thick, turgid, a burring mumble, husky with age, and a sort of senile mirth:\n\n“Heh! Heh! Heh!\n\n“I don’t know nothin’ … I ain’t wantin’ nothin’ … thankee … I minds m’ own business … “\n\nDe Collyer leaned back in his chair, and a throaty chuckle escaped him. He spoke in his natural voice, but with no boastfulness:\n\n“Perfect … perfect … to the letter … and … and … “\n\nHe paused as if a sudden thought, and a little smile twitched the comers of his mouth — a wolfish grin.\n\nDe Collyer did “imitations” when he could get booking, which had become increasingly difficult as he had acquired and fostered an increasing fondness for strong drink, despite its growing scarcity and the difficulty of acquisition.\n\nBesides his really remarkable mobility of features and genius at make-up, he was a superior mimic, but it had availed him little of late. For he had come to the pass where he would lie, beg, borrow, or steal for a drink. And perhaps, if the provocation were strong enough … Already he owed his landlady, Mrs. Finchley for three weeks’ board — and he had had no booking for months.\n\nHis face held a brooding, introspective look not pleasant to contemplate. De Collyer was desperately in need of money — and he had exhausted every possible source of revenue except — one.\n\nThe previous night, with his eye at the keyhole of a locked door leading to the room next his own, he had seen that which had inspired him with a plan — a sure way, as he told himself — out of his difficulties. All that it required was nerve — just a little nerve — the silencing of a conscience already almost atrophied in the sordid business of his hand-to-mouth existence.\n\nHurriedly, with flying fingers he obliterated the face in the mirror as a heavy step sounded in the hall without. It passed on — hesitated — paused at his door. It was locked, and the key turned to prevent its being pushed inward from without, but, of course …\n\nDe Collyer held his breath, but Mrs. Finchley evidently had reconsidered. Already he owed her for three weeks’ board. Well — he would owe her more than that before he had finished …\n\nIt would be a near thing, he decided — but — it could not fail.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nTh’ Last Word from Luther D. Gammage\n\nOld Luther Gammage was a “character” who never spoke unless directly addressed, and then in monosyllables.\n\n“I minds m’ own business,” he had vouchsafed on one occasion to the somewhat indiscreet advances of a fledgling boarder. “I ain’t got nothin’ — I ain’t wantin’ nothin’ — heh — heh — heh!”\n\nRumor had it that he was a miser — but even this speculation had died with the passage of years.\n\nGammage, however, did have a hobby, and a rather unusual one, namely, the collection of orchid blooms and their culture, and it had been the actor’s attempt to foist upon him a counterfeit seed of the rare, greenish Crane-Fly orchid which had aroused the old collector’s undying enmity — and suspicion.\n\nThis hobby, however, he had concealed as effectually as the source from which he derived his income. For he always paid cash. How De Collyer had accomplished the discovery of Gammage’s small conservatory in a cypress swamp in the outskirts was his own secret, but he had kept himself out of sight most effectually — a specialty of his — biding his time with an infinite patience which, valuable as Gammage’s collection undoubtedly was, was yet not aimed at the specimens which the silent old man had accumulated.\n\nTruly, De Collyer knew nothing of the five tribes, the 370 genera, or the five thousand species, and cared less. It had been from an altogether different motive that he had approached Gammage with his crude conterfeit — it was, after all, a seed, and, in his way, De Collyer was a rather clever sower of such …\n\nNow, on a misty evening of late Autumn, supper being over, Gammage approached Mrs. Finchley in what she afterward described as a kind of breathless excitement — for him. Afterward she declared to the coroner’s jury that she felt in her bones that something was wrong — there had been something — a premonition, a presentiment — but the good lady did not express it in just that fashion:\n\n“He ain’t never spoke three words in a month, gentlemen — not him — an’ this mornin’ he seemed all of a tremble, like — he says t’ me, he says: ‘Mis’ Finchley,’ he says, I’m goin’ a journey,’ he says, ‘an’ I mayn’t be back till late.’\n\n” ‘You ain’t well, Mr. Gammage,’ I says. ‘You better not go out t’day,’ I says. For his breath come sort of whistlin’ in his throat.\n\n“An’ then, f’r th’ first an’ last time in th’ days I knew him he seemed t’ get excited — a kind of queer fever come in his cheeks. ‘No, no, Mrs. Finchley,’ he quavers — ‘No, no — I must go — I gotta — but I’ll be back — t’night — late.’\n\n“An’ that’s th’ last word I had from Luther D. Gammage, gentlemen — th’ very last word, though 1 must say as I don’t rightly un’erstand … “\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Old Orchid Hunter’s Fear\n\nLuther Gammage left Mrs. Finchley’s a little while after supper, and he returned — late — as he had promised. He left the house openly, walked a matter of six blocks to a little-used car line, and there boarded a trolley which ran to the city limits.\n\nHalf a mile from the end of the tracks he entered the cypress swamp. For a heart-beat he stood, with his head upon his shoulder, listening — then plunged into the swamp as a man who burns his bridges behind him.\n\nIt was a gray evening, but even at high noon of blazing sunshine here there was perpetual twilight — greenish gray, sombre, repellent, daunting to a dweller of the sun-washed world without. Round about, for a radius of five miles, there were no houses, no living human abode in this whispering labyrinth, but there were not wanting tales of sights and sounds, witch-fires, will-o-the-wisps, which, rumor had it, were uneasy ghosts, pale wraiths whose luminance rose upon the fetid night in an unspeakable suggestion of old crimes, ancient victims.\n\nThe seed planted by De Collyer had borne fruit. As he went forward, delicately, across a quaking bog, Gammage’s hand felt for something in his pocket: something cold and hard and smooth — and a sudden, red rage possessed him as he envisaged the spoiler at his work …\n\nAs he approached the conservatory a brooding silence, like the dead, lifeless silence before storm, had settled upon the swamp, like a vast and smothering hand. Presently, just ahead, he made out the dim bulk of the building, squat, and somehow shapeless, sinister, silent.\n\nHe paused then, and waited, tense, quivering, but no sound nor sign issued out of the dimness. A minute passed — a minute of time, an hour of thought.\n\nSuddenly, as he watched, a thin, red pencil of light grew and broadened to a fanlike arc of yellow flame — a broad blotch of radiance quivered and died across the marsh.\n\n“Anstey!” he called suddenly, in a high, eager voice.\n\nAnstey was the caretaker. But with the words the light winked out, and as suddenly he remembered — or did he? Wasn’t this the day for the caretaker’s weekly trip to the city for supplies? Yes, of course, it was … it — - it was true, then …\n\n“Hophead” as well as drunkard, De Collyer, Gammage was convinced, would not have paused at murder for the accomplishment of his ends — and with the thought of a sudden, desperate resolution girded his sinews with steel. He covered the intervening space at a stumbling run — circled the corner of the low building — and came face to face with the intruder.\n\nAnd at what he saw in that face — the strangeness of it — the old orchid hunter’s fear and fury simmered to a sort of boiling quiet. He knew now what he had come to do. His resolution was taken.\n\n“You … you … damn ye, De Collyer!” he said evenly. “So that’s y’r game, hey? Well — I knowed ye first off … now … whut hev ye done with Anstey?”\n\nIn the dim twilight the face of the actor appeared oddly contorted. There was infinite venom, and an ugliness of unspeakable suggestion in his words as he answered lightly, hardily:\n\n“Whut hev I done with Anstey?” he mimicked. The tone was perfect. He went on in his natural voice:\n\n“Why — not a thing, old man,” he said. “I haven’t even seen him, if you ask me.”\n\nA chill wind rose and grew, like the whispering voices of dead fears upon the night. Had De Collyer … had he … something up his sleeve. To Gammage his collection was his life. Now, as he faced the sneering interloper before him, his rage and fear caught, as it were, a sudden, leaping spark from the green.eyes which mirrored his own — a premonition — a warning which burned into his with a sudden, leaping flame.\n\nAs if at a silent signal there came a sudden rush — the impact of two straining bodies — the flat crack of an automatic — then a dull, crunching thud — a quick heave — a stirring of the osiers at the edge of the deep tarn below. There followed a heavy splash — a gurgle — and the viscid slime heaving throughout its oily surface.\n\nOne more had been added to the grisly toll of the cypress swamp.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nOut of the Swamp\n\nOut of the swamp presently there emerged, alone, the bent and shuffling figure of the little old man, but now he walked as with an added burden of years, for behind him there stalked a Shadow — a shadow which henceforth would be with him, waking and sleeping — a shadow with stiff fingers and sightless eyes — a shadow reaching — reaching from the black ooze and the slime and the whispering silence which he had left behind.\n\nHe shivered a moment in the warm air as he waited for the trolley which presently roared down upon him with clanging bell and sharp screaming of brakes. He boarded it silently, a drab, inconspicuous figure which gained but a perfunctory notice from the conductor and the few passengers.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nMurderer!\n\nLuther Gammage left Mrs. Finchley’s a little while after supper — and he returned — late — as he had promised.\n\nA pin-point of gas burned in the narrow, malodorous hallway. It was the custom of the boarding-house that any lodger returning after midnight and finding the gas alight should extinguish it. Doubtless Mrs. Finchley’s star boarder remembered this. He extended a hand; the light winked out, and the thick darkness of the sleeping house took him to its heart.\n\nHe reached the hall above. His door was to the left — at the stairhead — and usually he could have found it blindfolded. For he was invariably a creature of habit.\n\nHe went forward a few paces. Now his groping hand, thrust out before him, fumbled at a door-knob, and then withdrew nervously at the feel of the cold, porcelain surface. Gammage’s door-knob was of glass, six-sided — - whereas this was round, and cold, and smooth — like the … like the … top of a skull.\n\nIt was De Collyer’s door. He paused as if to listen to the deep breathing within — but there was no sound that he could hear — his pale lips in the darkness trembled.\n\nMurderer! The word seemed to stand out in letters of fire, etched upon the black pall of the night like a corroding flame. For he had killed a man.\n\nNo one had seen. No one would ever discover the grisly evidence save at the beckoning finger of a remote and unthinkable chance. And yet … he had killed a man …\n\nDe Collyer had simply disappeared. He had often disappeared … for days at a time … He had sunk into that oblivious sea of missing men from which no faintest bubble of doubt or hint or trace would evermore rise upward into the ken of humankind. And there would be none to mourn him.\n\nHe wheeled to the right-about — and this time his thin fingers closed on the glass outline of the door-knob he sought.\n\nHe opened the door, stood for a moment, trembling as with fatigue, and then, steering an uncertain course in the velvet black, brought up sharply against the foot-board of an old-fashioned bed.\n\nDarkness plays strange tricks with one’s sense of direction … that bed had always stood … somewhere else … it was in the wrong place! Mrs. Finchley did not as a rule move her boarders’ furniture without due notice, but this … this …\n\nWith fumbling fingers, after several attempts, at length he lighted a match — and gargantuan shadows ran along walls and ceiling, in caricature of a little old man, lean, old. bearded and be whiskered of face.\n\nHe lit the gas. The bed was in its proper place, facing a blank wall between two closets, behind it the windows. Well … the darkness plays strange tricks with one’s sense of direction …\n\nHe gazed about him as one who sees that which is familiar and yet unfamiliar, his eyes flaming beneath their pent-house brows. Then, in a sudden, senseless panic he gained the door, laid his hand upon the bolt. With shaking fingers he slid it home.\n\nIt shrieked, rasping — not loudly — but with the quick squeak of a mouse in the wainscot. He moved backward to the bed, which stood, immovable, steadfast, facing, as it had always faced, the blank wall with its pattern of blood-red roses …\n\nHe undressed with a fumbling, clumsy haste, his fingers all thumbs, snapped out the light — to lie with staring eyes envisaging the impenetrable blank above him. After a while he closed them — but not to sleep …\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nYou’re In the Wrong Seat\n\nLuther Gammage had always been an early riser. And this morning his seat was occupied when Mrs. Finchley came into the basement dining-room. None of the other boarders had as yet put in an appearance, and at the landlady’s :\n\n“Good morning, Mr. Gammage!”\n\n“Mornin’, ma’am,” he mumbled, as he conveyed the spoon to his mouth, spilling a little of its contents on his none too immaculate stock.\n\nSuddenly the landlady, who had been scrutinizing him oddly, remarked with an air of stolid wonder:\n\n“Why — why, Mr. Gammage — you — you’re in the wrong seat — you’re … “\n\n“Heh?” came the muttered answer.\n\n“You — you’re in — Mr. De Collyer’s place.”\n\nA little silence fell — like a stone dropped into the placid surface of a pond, the ripples widening — expanding … in waves of suggestion. De Collyer’s chair! Coward conscience — mental suggestion — was that what it was? Well … he would have to be careful.\n\nA sudden, silent panic seized him, so that it seemed that his heart, throbbing dully within his ribs, would every instant betray him. What was it that was written of murderers … what was it?\n\n*“In the deep night; in the dark night Will I search thee out …\n\nYea, though thou coverest.thyself As with a mountain, yet will I find thee …”*\n\nIt seemed to the woman that the silent figure in the chair had aged overnight. She thought he looked ill, with a deep-seated illness. For he was a creature of habit, and as such it must be something more than mere absentmindedness which had caused him to depart from the habit of years — to pass his own accustomed place and to take the place of another. But before he could reply the landlady had gone on hurriedly:\n\n“Oh — but it don’t make no difference — of course … you stay right where you are, Mr. Gammage … De Collyer, now, he … he ain’t got exactly a mortgage on that seat, ‘f you ask me.” She released a laugh of blended sarcasm and friendly familiarity — turned — went to the window, fussed a moment with the shade — and then bustled outward to the kitchen.\n\nHis breakfast over, the little old man returned to his room, where, once inside, and the door closed and bolted, he stood a moment uncertainly — then, abruptly, there appeared in his face and bearing a sudden, startling transformation. He appeared to straighten visibly — his lips lost their accustomed slackness of age — his eyes glowed with sudden, biting life. He seemed to be in the grip of an overpowering and hard-held excitement.\n\nA small, leafed panel in the old-fashioned escritoire fell open at his touch. His exploring fingers thrust inward, and came away — empty. With a little, darting rush he was at the bureau — had ransacked the drawers in a twinkling — then turned to an ancient clothes-press, the which he laboriously explored — to no avail.\n\nThat which he sought still eluded him. Could it — was it possible that someone had been before him? No — -it was unthinkable — it simply could not be — it must not. Otherwise …\n\nHaste, haste, and more haste — speed, speed, and yet more speed! And yet — and yet — above everything he must avoid the appearance of hurry. That grisly Something by now fathoms deep in sludge — who could find it — who would even think to look …?\n\nHe glanced at his watch with a nervous, sidewise jerking of the head; then at an ancient clock set on a heavy, imitation porphyry base which stood on the mantel.\n\nAh! Now he remembered — stupid to have so forgotten! Was it …? Yes! Nerves … nerves … what a devil they played with one!\n\nFor with a quick, grasping movement he had lifted the clock — and there, wedged in at the bottom, between its four sprawling legs, was a bankbook — his bankbook.\n\n“I need a rest, that’s certain — that’s what I need,” he muttered. “Travel — that’s th’ ticket — a long trip.”\n\nThere sounded in the hall without a step — muffled voices — they were — they were approaching his door. His knees trembled, his hand stole with a convulsive gesture to the automatic in his pocket. There sounded a double rap upon the door, firm, authoritative, like a summons of doom.\n\nAt last!\n\nAn hour — an aeon — an eternity was compassed in his brief passage to the door. Under his futile fingers the bolt clanged and rattled — of what use to resist, unless … unless … Then it seemed as if the heavy door was flung inward from without, and in the aperture there loomed the vast bulk of brass-buttoned Authority: a policeman, behind him the grey face of the landlady. It had come, then!\n\n“We’re looking for … a gent named De Collyer,” came the booming voice. “This lady here … “\n\nBefore he could continue, or the other answer, came the landlady’s voice, apologetic, hurried:\n\n“Th’ officer’d like a description, sir. I — I give it to him, but he says mebbe y’ c’d tell us something else. He — he’s wanted f’r larceny, an’ I don’t know what-all.”\n\nWanted! The orchid-hunter gulped, swallowed, managed to articulate: “Why — I dunno, officer — he — I wasn’t — ain’t — he’s wanted, ye’ say? Well, well!”\n\nHis tones seemed suddenly more virile, but on the instant he seemed to shrink within himself. He seemed what he was: old, broken, as he continued :\n\n“I — I ain’t extry well, sir — I — I finds it hard to remember — hut — but — well — he wuz always hard up, I reckon … he wuz always broke, s’far ‘s I know. Heh — heh — heh! That’s ‘bout all I kin tell ye.”\n\nThe policeman grunted something inarticulate — swung on his heel without ceremony, glanced at the landlady, received a significant look, and the two turned, and passed on down the stairs.\n\nScraps of talk floated upward: “A regular title-taper, ‘f you ask me”; “A fine crook, sir!”\n\n“That’s what he was — a fine crook! An’ him owin’ me th’ best part of three weeks’ board … “\n\nThe little old man closed the door softly. He gave a smothered, nervous laugh. He was getting old — that was it — he had been growing older all the time — and now, at one stride, as it were, he was reaping the result. The door again bolted, he glanced carefully over the array of figures in the pass book, and a breathless ejaculation escaped him. He peered closely, as if disbelieving the evidence of his eyes — then slumped downward into a chair, muttering as if in disbelief.\n\nPresently he sat up — leaned over the old-fashioned marble-top table, drew toward him paper and pen, tracing words put down aimlessly in a meaningless repetition of the name: “Luther Gammage,” many times repeated. He ceased finally with a grunt of satisfaction:\n\n“‘s good,” he muttered. “Couldn’t challenge that!”\n\nA senile cackle sounded in his throat. “What’s in a name? A … a rose … by any other name … an orchid … money … money … money — that’s it — money — that’s in a name … my name.”\n\nThen: “The pen is … is … mightier than the … than the …”\n\nA curious expression, almost of fear, passed like a shadow over his face. He rose abruptly, and jamming the passbook in an inside pocket, descended the stairs. He met no one. The front door opened — clicked shut behind him — and he was gone.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nAll About the Murder of …\n\nGammage’s bank was the Thirteenth National, and thither, after leaving the boarding-house, the little old man proceeded. He was secure — safe — he told himself — both as to this and as to that other secret even now sunk fathoms deep in those unplumbed depths — but as he passed along the street he felt rather than saw a shadow detach itself from the opposite curb: a lean, hawklike face, hanging for a moment in a sort of vague menace, like a face without a body, projected out of the kaleidoscope of shifting humans, and then withdrew even as he looked.\n\nIn the brief instant that he had seen the face he had been conscious of its malevolent interest: the sardonic flicker of a ghastly meaning in the eyes … he shivered in the humid air.\n\nHe became aware that a ragged nondescript was following him, or so it seemed — was keeping pace with him, step for step … . With a tremendous effort of the will he glanced sidewise at the features of the newsboy: pinched, young-old, wise beyond imagining, and he fancied he detected in its expression that same calculating, studied appraisal.\n\n“Paper — sir — paper!” the gamin shrilled suddenly … . “All about …”\n\nAnd as suddenly he knew, with a curious, dread, shivering certainty, what he was about to hear: “All about the murder of … of …”\n\nProffering a coin with shaking fingers, he snatched the extra — then gasped almost audibly in overwhelming relief, as he made out to see, in one blinding survey, that it was the famous case of the “Pine-Tree Murder,” figuring a corpus delicti which had baffled the best efforts of the most efficient detectives. And now — and now — despite the more than Satanic ingenuity of the crime — the diabolical cleverness of its simplicity — they had — caught the murderer! And in his own case he knew but too well of what avail would be his plea of self-defence.\n\n“In the deep night; in the dark night Will I search thee out … Yea, though thou covercst thyself As with a mountain, yet will I find thee …”\n\nHe entered the bank, and as he went through the marble portal a man brushed by him furtively, yet with a certain meaning in his look, he could have sworn. And — was it the face he had seen in the crowd? Something told him that it was — an inner voice which he felt somehow to he an enemy — why, he could not have told. He noticed particularly the shoes: broad, square-toed, such as are worn commonly by plainclothesmen.\n\nLike a wind-driven spectre of fear, he walked into the bank: a little, old, bent, gray, shuffling figure of a man — bearded and bewhiskered — like an elderly and timorous mouse. That was the word the voluble Mrs. Finchley had used afterward at the inquest — a ghastly simile, indeed, when the amazing and unbelievable finale was written — when the face in the shadow had withdrawn forever — when behind the arras of Eternity there remained merely the voiceless answer of an impenetrable and infinite Silence … .\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nA Little — Unpleasantness\n\nThe murderer passed, with his dragging shuffle, down the ornate marble foyer, and approached the paying teller’s wicket.\n\n“Er — how much will it be this time, Mr. Gammage?” inquired the teller, perfunctorily. “The — the same, I presume, as usual?” Then, at the other’s muttered, scarce audible rejoinder: “Why — why — Mr. Gammage — “ he replied–“all of it?”\n\nThe teller gave an almost imperceptible shrug. “Very well, Mr. Gammage,” he pronounced. “Just as you sir … of course. … “ Automatically he pushed a white square of paper, together with a pen, across the space between them for the other’s signature. Idly the teller watched the long, slim fingers as they pot together the words:\n\nLuther D. Gammage Something — some seeming incongruity began tapping at the back of his brain, like the shadow of a suggestion, in a vague effort to recall — now, just what was it? But this passed in a fugitive glimmer of diminishing recollection as he recovered the slip, scanned it casually, made the usual comparison, and with a mechanical exactitude placed it in its proper compartment.\n\nBut — $17,000!\n\nHe would have liked to question the old man about it, but instead he asked merely:\n\n“How’ll you have it, Mr. Gammage?” at the other’s reply pushing a number of bills with saffron edges through the wicket, when there came a sudden, startling interruption: a long, gray-clad arm thrust between — there came a voice, hoarse, excited:\n\n“Mr. Dinsmore — just a moment …”\n\nWith the bills almost in his hand the bent figure stiffened — his mouth opened, then closed in a tight, quivering line as the teller disappeared from the window.\n\nIt had come, then! It was upon him! In some unforeseen, some unexpected, some inexplicable way, they had found him out!\n\nBut while he waited, in a sort of numb expectancy, for the hand on his shoulder and the word which should spell his doom, behind him there arose sounds of a scuffle, oaths, a quick panting.\n\nHe turned with an effort, in time to see a little knot of men split suddenly apart — the flash of steel — a gruff order — then two sullen individuals herded toward the offices in the rear by the uniformed man in gray and another in plain clothes. After an interval the face of Dinsmore, the teller, appeared, unwontedly flushed.\n\n“Ah … you’ll pardon me, Mr. Gammage. Just a little — unpleasantness … . I’m sorry … but it’s quite all right now, sir … . Here’s your money.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nThe Disappearance of De Collyer\n\nBut the little old man did not return immediately to the boarding-house, where, after notifying Mrs. Finchley of his intention of an indefinite leave (he would make it definite enough!) he meant to spend his last night in the city. It would not do for him to disappear too abruptly, although an insistent voice within him, an urgent, frantic voice dictated haste, haste, while there was time, while there was yet time. He had sent the caretaker a verbal message — the latter would question him in nothing — and as for that — that which was buried against all resurrection in the blind depths of the swamp — Anstey knew nothing — he would be as silent as his master. It was inconceivable that it would ever be found … .\n\nStill, he would leave nothing to chance — he would turn in his key in regular order to Ma Finchley, give up his room, and — disappear, like a stone sunk in a fathomless pool of silence and unplumbed depth. The encounter in the boarding-house; the face in the street; the preferred newspaper; the meeting in the doorway of the bank; the sudden apprehension of the bank-sneaks; these, whatever their significance, had left him curiously shaken.\n\nGammage had never been what is known as a drinking-man, but now he pushed open the swing-doors of a cafe on a side street, where, despite the Prohibition Act, certain commodities were dispensed on occasion for a price. Now, as he entered its cool gloom things were happening at Mrs. Finchley’s — things insignificant enough in themselves — neutral threads, if you will — but which, when woven into the tragic tapestry of my tale, showed bright scarlet against its sombre background of high light — and shadow:\n\nThreads of Destiny!\n\nBustle of activity in the second floor as something tall and oblong and heavy was shunted into Gammage’s room. The old man had always wanted it — why, no one knew exactly — and now Mrs. Finchley had been able to gratify his wish, or whim, or whatever it was — since, and this was made possible by event number.\n\nThe disappearance of De Collyer, the impecunious actor, whose room was “done up” in preparation for a future tenant, and the door locked. The day passed, and at the supper hour Mrs. Finchley wondered vaguely at the continued absence of Gammage.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nMacbeth Hath Murdered Sleep\n\nShadows were massed solidly so that the street seemed a canyon of darkness, a black well of silence without sound, yet curiously fluid, like a tide rising between the houses, which thrust upward on either hand in a dint jumble of roof and skylight and shaft. Presently there would be a moon, but just now there was deep, smothering blackness.\n\nOut of this dense darkness there emerged suddenly a lesser shadow — a grotesque, he seemed — a shadow figure in some curiously terrible pantomime in the faintly luminous dusk filtering downward from the remote pall of the sky.\n\nA key clattered in the latch — the door swung inward noiselessly — long, tapering fingers reached upward to the light, and a monstrous, leaping silhouette fled along the wall like a gigantic and menacing hand. Then the light winked out — there followed the muffled sounds of the ascent — heavy breathing.\n\nThe door of Gammage’s room opened silently — there came the brief noise of a scratching match — a creak of protest sounded from the ancient bed — the muffled thud of a shoe falling upon thick carpet — then a heavy, stertorous breathing. Long he slept, when presently, above the dreaming roofs, there grew a pale radiance — uprose the moon, like a silvered sentinel of night.\n\nThe sleeper stirred, moaned, tossing his arms abroad like a man in the grip of a viselike and inexorable terror — of a malignant and vengeful personality. Then, suddenly, with a strangled gasp, he awoke, and before him, upon the black wall of the night, in his mind’s eye — as one sees the after-reflection of a dazzling light upon the blackness — he beheld a vision: the grim portal of the swamp … facilis decensus Avemi … thither at whispering dusk, had he gone … and behind him had stalked … a Shadow … . For in truth had he murdered … sleep:\n\nMacbeth hath murdered sleep, and therefore Banquo Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more … .\n\nOnce more the sleeper seemed to see the swamp with its green glooms, its strange and perverted beauty of decay, in its heart that strange, amorphous excrescence of rocky ledge rising like a wart out of the morass. Here might one find, down-flung like a pale star at thunderous dawn, the exotic blooms of crane-fly or cyprepedium. Yet Gammage had gone far afield to fill his storehouse with the plunder of the outlands. And as such was it not worth the taking?\n\nAnd out of the swamp, presently, there had emerged, alone, a little old man, bearded and bewhiskered … alone … and yet behind him there seemed to peer another … behind …\n\n“Am I my brother’s keeper?”\n\nThe words seemed suddenly alive — hoarse with a sort of hypnotic cadence. Like a cinematographic impression, the vision persisted: the face, its lips writhed backward in a soundless snarl of rage and terror and surprise, appeared to stay — to remain — unfading, almost, he might have thought …\n\nInto the shadows at the foot of the bed there penetrated a long shaft of radiance, like a leprous-silvered finger, striking at the blank wall between the two closets — the rising moon. And in that ghostly radiance the face which he had seen moved — it was coming toward him — and upon it was the same expression of horror and surprise that it had worn when … when …\n\n“Dead men rise up never!”\n\nA lie — it was a lie — a cheat — for this was no figment of the imagination — it was real, it was horrible … it was … it was … .\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 11\n\nReflected In the Mirror\n\nWith a windy shriek De Collyer fell backward upon the bed, the mounting tide of his alcoholic frenzy culminating in an overwhelming wave of insane and blasphemous mouthing: the grim justice of a retributive madness.\n\nFor the face which he had seen had indeed been that of Gammage — and yet as in a glass darkly — for, by a strange, retributive, poetic justice, he had seen it with his own eyes, indeed: the bearded image of his victim — the perfect likeness which he had counterfeited — the speaking likeness, indeed, which he had put on in the cypress swamp and since retained — reflected in the mirror which in his absence the landlady had caused to be transferred from his own room to the bare space between the closets at the foot of Gammage’s bed!\n\nTHE END\n"

The enlargements were also his own work; he had fitted up a homemade apparatus in Hawke’s laboratory.\n\nDixon Hawke treated this new phase of his assistant’s with good-natured tolerance, and had consented to pose for some indoor time exposures. Tommy was now inviting criticism, and lifting one of the prints, Hawke said with feigned nonchalance:\n\n“H’m, not bad for an amateur,” and bent his head to hide the twinkle in his eye.\n\nTommy opened his mouth indignantly.\n\n“An amateur —” he began, but the shrill ringing of the doorbell interrupted him.\n\nTommy glanced quickly at his master. It was late Saturday forenoon, and they had just completed their business of the week; no callers were expected.\n\nAs the housekeeper was out, Tommy hurried to the door and ushered in a young lady, who introduced herself to the detectives as Miss Irene Walsford.\n\nMiss Walsford was a tall blonde, with delicate features and wide blue eyes.\n\nHawke had risen to meet his visitor, and his practised eye noted that she was suffering from great mental agitation. He at once set about putting her at her ease.\n\n“I don’t think we have met before, Miss Walsford, but your photograph is known to me. In fact,” he smiled, “since your engagement to Mr. Litteton I might say it is very well known.”\n\nThe girl smiled wanly.\n\n“Yes, the newspapers have made a fuss. You see, Ralph is so well known in the City. We are to be married in three months, and —and that is —well, er —I —. Please read these, Mr. Hawke.”\n\nFumbling in her handbag, Miss Walsford handed the detective five letters.\n\nAs he scanned the letters Hawke’s brows contracted into a frown. He was amazed and disgusted at the temerity of the unknown writer.\n\nThe letters were addressed to Miss Walsford, and purported to give her information of the supposed nefarious conduct of her fiancé, Ralph Litteton. Mention was freely made of “another woman,” together with reports of drunken orgies at obscure night clubs.\n\nDixon Hawke threw the letters on the desk with a gesture of distaste, and turned to his troubled client.\n\nMiss Walsford was biting her lip nervously. It was easy to see that, although she was shocked at the letters, they had created a suspicion in her mind. Hawke said abruptly:\n\n“Miss Walsford, I forbid you believing one word of what is written here. Furthermore, I suggest that you show Mr. Litteton these letters immediately. I gather you have not done so.”\n\nThe girl looked up, startled.\n\n“No, no, Mr. Hawke, I couldn’t do that. I don’t want to worry Ralph. That is why I came to you.”\n\n“But why have you waited so long?”\n\n“I —I thought if I simply took no notice of them they would stop. I have received one every Monday, and —well, I simply could not bear to wait this weekend. The suspense is terrible. But, please, there must be no publicity. The scandal would be dreadful.”\n\nThe detective frowned.\n\n“There is only one way to stop this sort of thing, Miss Walsford, and you are playing into the writer’s hands in refusing to prosecute. I must insist that you prosecute and that you tell Mr. Litteton at once.”\n\n“Very well, Mr. Hawke, if you think that is best. But leave me to tell Ralph.”\n\nDixon Hawke picked up the letters and the envelopes.\n\n“As you wish, Miss Walsford. However, you might leave them with me for the present. I shall have copies made and return the originals to you shortly. I see the postmarks are all different. Here is one marked Liverpool.”\n\n“That was the first. Then Manchester, Leeds, York, and Hull.”\n\nHawke noted the sequence on the envelopes and continued with some routine questions.\n\nMiss Walsford was unable to supply any further information, and a few minutes later she left the criminologist’s rooms.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nFind the Motive!\n\nWhen the door had closed, a transformed Hawke turned back to the desk and Tommy sprang to do his bidding as Hawke handed him the letters.\n\n“Get busy with that camera of yours, Tommy. Give me enlarged prints of each of those letters.”\n\nThe young assistant was not long in carrying out the order, and, leaving the damp prints to dry, Tommy hurried into the office, to find Dixon Hawke studying a map of England and a Post Office Guide.\n\nHawke looked up as his assistant entered.\n\n“We’ve got to find a motive, Tommy. Find out Litteton’s address in the City. We’ll start there.”\n\nLitteton &amp;amp; Company were wine importers. Although Ralph Litteton was a director of several businesses, his main interest was in the offices at which the two detectives called.\n\nProffering his card to the girl who inquired his business, Dixon Hawke and his assistant were ushered into the inner office.\n\nRalph Litteton greeted Hawke affably.\n\n“This is certainly an unexpected pleasure, Mr. Hawke. I don’t think we’ve met, but your name is well known.”\n\nHawke smiled as he gripped the outstretched hand. “If you don’t mind, Mr. Litteton, I should like to put a few routine questions.”\n\n“What! Don’t tell me you suspect me of being an international crook.”\n\nDixon Hawke laughed and briefly explained to Litteton that he was on the track of a man or men whom he believed had been employed by the wine importer.\n\nLitteton pursed his lips.\n\n“Afraid I can’t help you very much there. There are quite a few men in the warehouse here, and, although I engaged them and so forth, I leave all supervisory work to my foreman, Brown. To tell you the truth, these last two or three weeks I have been so busy I have been taking very little interest in the business here.”\n\n“Perhaps I could see Brown.”\n\n“Yes, that would be best.”\n\nLitteton pressed the bell, and, to the girl who answered its summons, he said:\n\n“Miss Wilson, take Mr. Hawke to the warehouse and instruct Brown to give him all the help he can. You’ll excuse me if I don’t come along. I’m rather busy, and I —”\n\nDixon Hawke interrupted quickly.\n\n“Quito all right, Mr. Litteton. I am sure Mr. Brown will take very good care of us.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Dismissed Clerk\n\nWhen Dixon Hawke had explained his business to the warehouse foreman, Brown looked doubtful.\n\n“Well, there’s been two men sacked here recently, Mr. Hawke,” he said.\n\n“The first was Oxenam, one of the carters, and the other was a clerk, Meazer.”\n\nHawke looked interested.\n\n“And the reason?”\n\n“I caught Oxenam beating one of the horses, and Meazer —”\n\nWhile the man was talking they had been walking through the warehouse.\n\nAt this moment they were passing through a room where three clerks were working at a long desk, and Brown was interrupted by a cry from the outside.\n\n“Bottles.”\n\nInstantly one of the clerks left his desk and crossed the room to where a narrow conveyor belt emerged from the left wall, and terminated in a large tray. Below the tray a larger belt continued across the room, disappearing through the right wall.\n\nSeating himself on a stool, the clerk pulled over a switch, and the belts whirred into motion. Long-necked bottles appeared on the narrow belt, and began piling up on the tray. Waiting until a number had gathered, the clerk pulled a small lever, and the tray tilted, depositing the bottles on the lower belt, where they were whisked out of sight. At the same time the clerk made a note on a paper by his side.\n\nThe two visitors watched the operation with interest.\n\n“Quite an ingenious idea,” Dixon Hawke commented.\n\n“Yes, it was Mr. Litteton’s idea,” Brown explained. “You see, we unpack imported wines on the right, and they have to be carried through to the left, and the clerks have to count and check them.”\n\nHawke watched the clerk closely.\n\n“By the way,” he said, “that man was writing with his right hand when we came in. I see that he made these notes with his left. Is he ambidextrous?”\n\n“Er —ambi —”\n\n“I mean, can he write with both hands?”\n\n“By Jove, you have quick, eyes, Mr. Hawke! No, that’s just a trick they learn working those belts. You see, the lever is on the right side and there is only room for their book on the left, and it is easier to write with the left. They don’t actually write, of course. Just scribble a number and some code letters, then enter them in the ledgers here. That reminds me. This is where that fellow Meazer worked, until I discovered he was slipping bottles off the belt and biding them behind the switchboard there. He walked out at night, as calm as you please, with a bottle under his coat.”\n\n“You sacked him?”\n\n“Well, I reported him to Mr. Litteton, and he told me to get rid of him.”\n\nContinuing the conversation, Dixon Hawke was gratified to learn that Brown could give him particulars of the whereabouts of the two men.\n\nOxenam, it appeared, had learned to drive a car, and was working as a lorry driver between London and the Midlands, whilst Meazer had a position with a firm of wholesale manufacturers.\n\nAfter a short tour of the warehouse the two detectives bade good-bye to Brown.\n\nLeaving the warehouse, they made their way to the addresses which the foreman had given them, and confirmed the information about Oxenam, at the same time eliciting the fact that Meazer was employed as a commercial traveller, working a Midlands district.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nTracking Down Meazer\n\nDixon Hawke looked thoughtful as he returned to the office.\n\nTaking the dry prints from Tommy, he studied them carefully. For some ten minutes he concentrated his attention upon the enlarged writing, and Tommy Burke, watching closely, strove to follow his master’s line of thought.\n\nThe writing in each of the letters was identical. It was slow, laboured writing, sprawling all over the page, and had evidently been the subject of much concentration on the part of the writer. It resembled the painful efforts of a child. Suddenly Hawke looked up.\n\n“Go down to Simpson’s, the hardware manufacturers, and ask for the loan of a sample bag —a small one will do —and an order book.”\n\nTommy Burke looked surprised, and Hawke smiled.\n\n“Go along, my lad. I’m not thinking of changing my profession, if that’s what is troubling you. Bring that bag to the station; we are going to Sheffield. I’ll pack everything we need personally.”\n\nAn hour later Dixon Hawke and his assistant were entrained and speeding towards Sheffield. On the rack above their heads reposed a leather bag containing samples of Simpson’s manufactures, and from Hawke’s pocket protruded a blue order book.\n\nIn Sheffield Dixon Hawke hailed a taxi. To the driver he explained that he and Tommy were commercial travellers new to the district, and asked the driver to take them to some good hotel where they might meet some fellow-travellers.\n\n“I know the very place you want, sir,” the man answered. “The Bank Hotel, in Swintell Street.”\n\nAfter they had arrived there and Hawke had signed the register as Mr. Robertson, he engaged the clerk in conversation.\n\n“By the way,” he said casually, “I think an acquaintance of mine comes here —a Mr. Meazer. Will you tell me if he arrives to-day?”\n\n“Oh, yes, I know Mr. Meazer, sir,” the clerk answered readily. “He arrived only a short time ago. He comes here every five weeks.”\n\nWhen the clerk mentioned the name, Tommy Burke’s eyes instantly dropped to the register. A few names above their own, the name “Meazer” was inscribed.\n\nTommy was bitterly disappointed; the writing was in no way comparable to that of the letters. Once again Tommy found himself stumped, and the clerk was speaking again.\n\n“Why, there is Mr. Meazer now, sir. Just going into the dining-room. Shall I call him?”\n\nHawke answered quickly:\n\n“No, no. I’ll look him up after tea.”\n\nTommy Burke needed no prompting. He followed their man into the dining-room and took a table some distance from the corner where the man was seating himself.\n\nCompleting his arrangements at the desk, Dixon Hawke joined his assistant, and they observed Meazer order tea.\n\n“That’s our man, Tommy,” Hawke whispered.\n\nTommy accepted the information without question.\n\n“How are we going to get him, guv’nor?”\n\nDixon Hawke pursed his lips.\n\n“That’s it, my lad. We have no definite proof. We shall have to wait developments. Keep an eye on him, but be careful he is not aware he is under observation.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nCaught in the Act\n\nAfter tea Tommy Burke followed Meazer closely, but two hours passed before he observed any suspicious move.\n\nMeazer wandered around the hotel, read a paper, spoke to a few men, and generally behaved in the manner of a man idling away his time. Suddenly, as if the idea had occurred to him or he had come to a decision, he made his way to the writing-room.\n\nAs this was late Saturday afternoon the writing-room was empty.\n\nMeazer made his way to one of the writing-tables. Taking a piece of paper from his pocket, he picked up a pen and began to write.\n\nTommy Burke, watching from the doorway, gave a gasp of excitement. Meazer was writing with his left hand. From the awkward manner in which the pen was held, it was easy to see that this was not the writer’s normal position.\n\nTommy Burke hurried off to find his master. Returning with Hawke to the door of the writing-room, he pointed to the bent back of the industrious Meazer and whispered:\n\n“He’s using his left hand.”\n\nDixon Hawke smiled.\n\n“Easy, isn’t it, Tommy? However, we’ve got to get that letter. Go into the room, pick up an envelope or something, and stumble against Meazer. Make no noise, and try to catch a glimpse of what he is writing.”\n\nTommy carried out the instructions carefully.\n\nAs the lad stumbled against him, Meazer instantly covered his work and cursed the apologising Tommy profusely.\n\nTommy, however, had seen all that was necessary. The letter began — “Dear Miss Walsford.”\n\nPicking up some sheets of writing-paper, Tommy renewed his apologies and hurried from the room.\n\nDixon Hawke nodded approval at his assistant’s information.\n\n“Now we’ve got him. Just give him a few minutes to settle down again.”\n\nMeazer watched Tommy’s exit suspiciously, and, muttering to himself, turned once more to his letter. For a few minutes he considered what he had written, then bent to his task.\n\nThen a hand like a steel vice suddenly seized his wrist.\n\n“Quite a pleasant after-dinner recreation, Mr. Meazer,” Hawke said.\n\nStarting back in his chair, his eyes dilated with terror, Meazer gasped: “Who are you?”\n\nDixon Hawke ignored the question and glanced at the letter on the table.\n\nThe scandalous contents of the latest epistle were enough to prove beyond all shadow of doubt that Meazer was responsible for the poison-pen letters.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nWhat the Letters Revealed\n\nIn his office that Saturday night was enacted a little drama which gave Dixon Hawke great satisfaction. Miss Walsford had just arrived, summoned by an urgent telephone message, and with her came her fiancé, Mr. Ralph Litteton.\n\n“Look here, Mr. Hawke,” he burst out as the detective greeted him. “I wish you’d find the rat for me. You can claim any fee you like.”\n\nHawke smiled as he motioned him to a seat.\n\n“I can appreciate your feelings. I presume Miss Walsford has acquainted you with the facts?”\n\n“Yes. She told me the wretched story.”\n\nLitteton took a seat beside his fiancée. As he did so he became aware of a man seated in a corner of the room.\n\n“Hello, Meazer. What are you —By Jove, you —you are —”\n\nWith a start Litteton jumped to his feet, but Hawke intervened.\n\n“Please, Mr. Litteton, you must remain quiet.”\n\nWalking across the room, Dixon Hawke addressed the girl:\n\n“Miss Walsford, I am glad to be able to give you a certain amount of satisfaction in this painful business. I have brought the author of those letters here to offer an apology. I regret this distressing scene, but since you do not wish publicity, I feel this my only alternative.”\n\nTurning to the cringing Meazer, he continued:\n\n“Now, please make your statement.”\n\nMeazer rose from his chair and addressed the girl.\n\nIn halting sentences the man told how he had been employed by Litteton, and had been dismissed for pilfering. The dismissal had rankled in his mind until the announcement of his ex-employer’s engagement had given him the opportunity for revenge, and he had attempted to wound Litteton through the girl. He ended with an abrupt apology.\n\nDuring this time Miss Walsford made no remark. It was obvious that the interview was as painful to her as it was to the wielder of the “poison pen.” When the man had finished Dixon Hawke stepped across to the door and pulled it open. On the threshold stood a man with a notebook in his hand.\n\n“Did you get it all, Inspector?”\n\n“Every word,” the man replied, and slipped handcuffs on Meazer, whom he led away.\n\nWhen the police officer had gone with his prisoner, Hawke turned to Miss Walsford.\n\n“I must apologise for the deception. Miss Walsford, but you realise that you owe that to the public. I think this fright will cure Meazer of any further “poison pen” attempts. There will be no names given at the trial, and you need fear no scandal.”\n\nAlone with Tommy Burke after his clients had gone, Dixon Hawke turned to his assistant.\n\n“I see the questions in your face, Tommy, and I think I owe you an explanation. I shall try to explain my line of deduction.”\n\nSeating himself at his desk, Dixon Hawke arranged the letters and photographic prints before him, while Tommy watched his chief closely.\n\n“You see,” Hawke began, “in the first place, the writing is laboured, which offers the obvious explanation that the writer was illiterate. If you will study the letters closely, however, you will see that they are balanced and written in good English. You will also observe certain characteristics —a certain flourish which denotes the practised writer. Now, when I write with my right hand there is a flourish to my writing which is the outcome of years of constant use of the pen; when I take the pen in my left hand I not unnaturally attempt to write my normal style. This is a mistake, as my left hand must be trained from simple forms, as has been my right.\n\n“One other point. All normal people form the letter ‘o’ anti-clockwise. In these letters the word ‘ on ‘ occurs frequently, and friend Meazer in the first of the letters has formed the ‘o’ clockwise, which is easier with the left hand, but towards the end he has reverted to his normal style.\n\n“There are other small points —for instance, where he has retouched with his right hand, but these are the main features. From them I concluded that the writer was a practised penman, and someone who, although not ambidextrous, had at least some skill with his left hand. Our little tour of the warehouse confirmed my deductions.”\n\n“And Sheffield, guv’nor?”\n\n“Well, the letters came from towns forming a circuit. I chose Sheffield as the next largest town on the circuit.”\n\n~THE END~\n"

      "content_html": "In twenty years he’d never had to use the gun. Now it looked as if he might have to break his record …\n\nJess had kept his eye on the two since they had come in. Both of them were young, hardly more than kids, dressed “cat” style in Mr. B shirts, draped coats and peg pants. They had not caused any trouble. All they had done was sit quietly at the end of the bar drinking beer.\n\nStill Jess did not like their looks. Hoods he could handle because he always knew what they were thinking. Kids were different. They were always surprising you. You couldn’t trust any of them.\n\nStanding behind the bar he watched the place slowly empty. The two of them did not move.\n\nJess was not afraid. He had owned the bar for twenty years and had yet to use the forty-five that rested on a shelf beneath the register. Occasionally, he would have a trouble-some drunk but very seldom. Usually the drunk would take one look at the scar tissue around Jess’ eyes, his flattened nose, and cauliflower ear, then decide to move on.\n\nFinally the kids were the last customers left. Slowly, dabbing at glass rings on the bar with a rag, Jess moved down toward them.\n\n“I’m sorry, fellows,” he said, “I’m closing up. You’re going to have to come back another time. Sorry.”\n\nHe grinned, showing his two gold teeth.\n\nThey only stared at him and drank their beer.\n\nLittle punks, he thought. Trying to act smart. They’re all alike. They’re what’s wrong with the world. Punks.\n\n“It’s after curfew, so I can’t serve you, anyway. So would you mind finishing up and moving along?” Jess was still grinning. “Come back any time between five and midnight. I’ll be glad to have you.”\n\nOne kid turned to the other.\n\n“Did you hear the man say something, Phil?”\n\n“No, I sure didn’t. Maybe he just coughed.”\n\n“Yeah. That must have been it.”\n\n“He’s real clever,” the one called Phil said.\n\nIf it had not been for the hardness in their eyes Jess would have laughed at them. They were talking like a couple of movie, tough guys.\n\n“I’m going to have to ask you to move on,” Jess said again.\n\n“I don’t think he wants us here, Phil. He’s trying to get us to beat it.”\n\n“That makes me feel lousy, when somebody tells me to leave a place.” Phil sipped his beer. “I hate for people not to like me. It makes me feel lousy. Know what I mean?”\n\nJess wanted to tell them to act their age but instead he said, “Look, I know how it is when you’ve had a couple too many. Go on home and sleep it off. No hard feelings.”\n\n“That’s damn white of you,” Phil said. “It makes me feel good all over. There’s only one thing that would make me feel better.”\n\nPhil grinned and took a pack of cigarettes from his coat pocket.\n\n“You know what that is?”\n\nHe lit a cigarette and blew a stream of smoke through his nose.\n\n“Well, it would be for you to open that register and give us a little going-away present. That would make us feel real good.”\n\nAll the time the boy had been speaking the two of them had not taken their eyes from Jess. He was beginning to sweat. He felt it trickle down his back and knew his shirt was turning dark beneath the arms.\n\n“All right,” Jess said, making his voice hard, “you guys had better cut it out now and beat it. Go on now and I won’t remember what you look like. If you don’t, I’ll see that you spend a little time on the roads. If you don’t believe me, just keep up the way you’re going.”\n\n“You’re real tough, aren’t you?”\n\n“Tough enough to handle two punks like you.”\n\nPhil put his hand inside his coat and let it stay.\n\n“If I have to take my hand out you know what’s going to happen, don’t you?”\n\n“You’re making a big mistake,” Jess said.\n\n“Yeah. I’m going to lose all kinds of sleep over it.”\n\n“Cut out the stalling,” Phil said. “Open the register.”\n\nJess watched the two of them as he edged toward the register.\n\n“You kids had better think this over.”\n\n“Come on.”\n\nAs Jess reached the register he laid his hand on the butt of the forty-five resting on its shelf. It felt cold and heavy in his hand as he turned and fired.\n\nHe had hurried his first shot a bit and it was wild, smashing the neon clock above the men’s room. But the next two shots were not wild. The kid beside Phil was hurled from his stool to the floor beside one of the booths.\n\nIt was not like the movies. He didn’t wobble or groan. One moment he was sitting on the stool, the next he was laying on his back beside one of the booths.\n\nPhil had dropped down beside his stool, sobbing, “Don’t shoot. Don’t shoot. I don’t have any rod. For God’s sake, we were only kidding. Don’t shoot.”\n\nJess walked around the bar and stood looking down at him. He was crouched beside the stool, unable to keep his eyes from the body beside the booths.\n\n“Get up,” Jess said.\n\nPhil stood, muttering, “You didn’t have to level on us. Why the hell did you do it?”\n\nJess lowered the gun.\n\n“Don’t try nothing, punk. Just stand easy.”\n\nHe went to the pay phone and put in a call to the police. All the time he was talking he did not take his eyes from the kid.\n\nWhen he came back the kid had stopped sobbing.\n\n“Look, mister,” he pleaded. “You got to let me go. I never done nothing like this before. Honest to God. It will kill my folks.”\n\nJess looked at him.\n\nPunk kids, he thought, are what’s wrong with the world now. He’ll get a couple of years in the reformatory and be back out to bother innocent people.\n\n“All right, kid,” Jess smiled. “Beat it.”\n\n“You mean it?”\n\n“Sure. Go ahead.”\n\nThe kid stood in the doorway without moving, watching him coldly.\n\nJess said: “What are you waiting for? I’m not going to tell the police anything about you.”\n\n“You’re damn right you’re not,” the kid said thinly.\n\nJess never felt the bullet that smashed into his brain.\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Ingleside\n  The Oregon Express\n  Galloped Away on Bicycles\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nIngleside\n\nHard-riding hombres of the Old West laughed in decision on hearing the strange news. Two pistol-fading gents who never forked a bronc had succeeded the Renos, the Daltons, the Youngers and the James boys in the train-robbing business. This pair looted the steam cars and made their getaway on bicycles. It sounded funny.\n\nBut Big Jim Browning and his small partner, Jade Brady, were not characters to be laughed at. This fact Connie Stagg learned a split second too late. Connie happened to be a tough guy himself. His last mistake was thinking that the stickup of his roadhouse at Ingleside, near San Francisco, on the dark foggy night of May 5, 1895, was a practical joke.\n\nConnie sat at a little table in his barroom playing poker with Adolf Huber. All the other customers had gone home. Oil lamps shed a dim light over the wall clock that was just about to clasp its hands in midnight embrace. Beneath a cruddy painted “Venus at the Bath,” the bartender slowly polished his schooners, killing time until the boss wanted to close. A waiter had just begun to sweep out. There was nobody else around.\n\nThe door opened. Big Jim and his pal entered with a swirl of fog. Both were masked. They carried wicked-looking six-shooters leveled for action. The tall man barked:\n\n“Hands up, everybody!”\n\nThree pair of hands reached for the ceiling. Connie grinned and slapped a card on the table.\n\n“Hello, boys! This ain’t masquerade night. But go ahead and have your fun!”\n\nBrowning snarled: “I said hands up!”\n\nThe roadhouse owner was still smiling pleasantly. “It’s not safe to play with them things. They might be loaded.”\n\n“For the last time — “\n\n“All right,” beamed Connie, “I’ll play too.”\n\nHis right hand reached jestingly under the table. Two six shooters spat vicious flame. Connie’s smile faded. He clutched the table, wobbled crazily, and fell to the floor. Browning bent over him.\n\n“Dead as a mackerel!”\n\nWhile the short man was rifling the pockets of the late proprietor and the others. Big Jim ransacked the cash drawer. They stuffed the money, two watches and a diamond stickpin into their own pockets. Big Tim croaked a warning as they backed to the door:\n\n“See that clock? Don’t move till it says ten after twelve! Anyone who does’ll get a dose of lead.”\n\nThere was no doubt that the tall man meant what he said. The three murder witnesses waited tensely till twelve-fifteen. Then they phoned the police. By the time the hands reached twelve-thirty, bluecoats and enraged neighbors were scouring the town of Ingleside and its vicinity. But the killers had vanished into thick white fog, silently pedaling away on bicycles. How they escaped was not learned till weeks afterward.\n\nThe clue came with an epidemic of armed robberies in the gas-lit streets, stores and homes of San Francisco. The crime wave lasted more than two months. People feared to venture outdoors after dark. Most of the holdups during that period ran true to pattern: a tall man, a short man, both masked, armed and riding bikes. It was easy for the police to connect this reign of terror with the roadhouse murder.\n\nSan Francisco’s detective force was concentrated on this case. Every night a hundred sleuths in plain clothes roamed the streets, hoping the cyclists would try to rob them. Police were told, “Shoot to kill!” On two or three occasions the, bandits were sighted pedaling away, but fled unscathed after an interchange of bullets.\n\nNewspapers printed a police notice: “All men are warned not to ride bicycles in pairs at night, lest they be mistaken for the two robbers and shot oil sight.” Another notice advised people who traveled the streets after dark to carry little or no money with them.\n\nIn July of that year, detectives learned the names of the bicycle bandits and checked up on their records. Both had served prison terms in San Quentin for grand larceny, were released in 1892, and subsequently worked as ranch hands in various parts of California. Shortly after these facts came out, the two men ceased to operate in San Francisco.\n\nThe city had become too hot for them. Besides, they aimed at bigger stakes. They knew that the express cars of through trains carried safes filled with money. One lucky haul could give them a life on Easy Street.\n\nThey studied Southern Pacific timetables. The southbound Oregon Express, thundering through the night from Portland to Oakland, looked like a perfect setup. It crossed the Sacramento River at the California state capital under cover of darkness. The opposite side of the river was pretty much deserted. They cruised around the spot on bicycles, noting every detail.\n\n“Good place to bury the loot,” said Brady, nodding toward a clump of bushes.\n\nHis partner rolled a cigarette and lit it.\n\n“Couldn’t be better. We’ll hide our bikes an’ a shovel near the river bank an’ meet the train on the bridge when she’s goin’ slow.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Oregon Express\n\nCame the night of August 25th — less than four months after the roadhouse murder. A bright moon. The Oregon Express rumbled hollowly across the bridge and was just about to pick up speed when two masked figures darted out of the shadows and swiftly climbed onto the tender. Each had a burlap bag sticking out of his left pocket.\n\nDrawing revolvers, Browning and Brady worked their way down the dark shifting coal pile and stepped across the gangway into the lighted engine cab. Engineer and fireman whirled around.\n\n“Robbers!” gasped the engineer.\n\nBig Jim stood with feet apart to brace himself in the swaying cab. There was a hard grin on his face and his eyes glittered as wickedly as a rattlesnake’s.\n\n“See these guns? I’m givin’ the orders. Now stop this train damn quick!’’\n\nWith a deft movement of each hand, the engineer shut his throttle and set the air brakes. The Oregon Express jerked violently to a stop. Wheels ceased rolling on the far side of the bridge, about a mile from the village of Washington. Following their pre-arranged plans, Brady kept the engine crew covered while Browning uncoupled the first car, the Wells Fargo express, from the other cars.\n\nThen, to the engineer: “Pull ahead a few hundred yards! … Okay, stop here! … You two get off an’ walk back to the train! An’ don’t look around!”\n\nBrowning and Brady then turned their attention to the treasure car. In each of their burlap bags was wrapped a stick of dynamite. One stick shattered a car door that the express messenger refused to open. The bandits climbed in. Big Jim pointed to the safe with his pistol.\n\n“Open that!’’\n\n“I can’t,” protested the Wells Fargo man. “That’s a through safe. The company locks it in Portland and doesn’t open it till we get to Oakland. I don’t even know what’s inside.”\n\n“The hell you don’t!”\n\nJim’s pistol butt swung down on the messenger’s head. Dazed and bleeding, the man stuck to his story. Browning hit him again. At last he was satisfied that the messenger was telling the truth. He turned to Brady.\n\n“Okay, Jack, we’ll use your dynamite now.”\n\nThe wrecked safe yielded a fortune. There were fabulous piles of large-denomination bank notes, crisp and neatly wrapped, as well as small white sacks stenciled Wills Fargo Express Co. Each sack was bulging with shiny gold coins. Expert fingers counted the booty — about fifty thousand dollars! The bandits gloated as they dumped it into the bags.\n\nThese they lugged over to the bushes, glancing back at the dismembered train to see if they were being watched. Then they buried the treasure by moonlight, patting down the black earth with care.\n\nFinally, mounting their bikes, they rode away. Neither suspected that a stranger, peering through the shadowy march tules at the river’s edge, had witnessed the burial with greedy eyes.\n\nMeanwhile, telegraph and telephone wires were carrying news of the crime all over the state. Trainmen and passengers had run from the stranded cars to Washington village and spread the alarm. Even before Browning and Brady left the express car, posses were being sworn in at the state capital, Sacramento, just across the river, to track them down.\n\nAt first the law officers were mystified at the getaway, for nobody had seen horses or heard the thud of hoofs. When the Wells Fargo man described his assailants as “one tall, the other short,” law officers quickly connected them with the cyclists who had terrorized San Francisco during the summer. But no hint of this conclusion was allowed to reach the newspapers.\n\nAs one sleuth put it:\n\n“We mustn’t tip ‘em off that we think they robbed the express. If they abandon their wheels they’ll be harder to catch.”\n\nAnd so, lulled into false security, Browning and Brady pedaled back to the river one day to dig up the fortune. Their spirits were high. As they rode along that day in early September, 1895, they talked of plans they had already made to travel abroad.\n\nBut at the burial spot a rude shock awaited them. The money was gone! Someone else had gotten there first. Frantically they searched, turning up the black soil. No luck!\n\n“Don’t look at me that way!” croaked Big Jim. “You know I didn’t take it an’ I know you didn’t.”\n\n“Then who did?” the short man demanded.\n\n“How in hell should I know? Mebbe some lousy gumshoe. But I ain’t bawlin’ over spilled milk. It’s gone now an’ we’re almost flat busted. We gotta pull another job.”\n\nA few days later the partners in crime went to Yuba City, California. After hiding their bikes under a bridge, they hired a farmer to drive them in his buggy to the Davisville station of the S. P. There they bought tickets, boarded a late afternoon train, and sat in a day coach.\n\nThey did not expect to find valuable express cargo on this train, but they did know that its Pullmans usually carried a lot of miners and farmers who had just collected money in San Francisco. Their plan was quite simple. Pull the bell cord near Yuba City to stop the train. Walk through the Pullmans with guns drawn and collect from the passengers. Escape as usual on bicycles.\n\nOne detail they overlooked. Further down the aisle in their day coach sat a former convict who had known Browning and Brady at San Quentin. He recognized them, but they did not see him. Walking casually into the car behind, he found the conductor.\n\n“Do you remember the Connie Stagg murder case?” he asked in a low tone.\n\n“Yes, what about it?” replied the trainman.\n\n“The killers are on this train. I know them both. A tall guy and a short one, sitting together near the front of the car ahead.”\n\nThe conductor took a good look at them. Then, at the next stop, he sent a telegram asking Sheriff Bogard of Yuba County to meet the train at Marysville. He knew that the two suspects had bought tickets for a point further on.\n\nWhen the train ground to a stop at Marysville, the sheriff and a posse climbed aboard. The conductor pointed out that two cyclists. Bogard covered them with a Colt .45.\n\n“You’re under arrest!”\n\nThose were his last words. With a lightning draw, Big Jim drilled him through the heart. But the dying sheriff fired also, and Browning toppled over dead. Before the other passengers could guess what was happening, the deputies had overpowered Jack Brady.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nGalloped Away on Bicycles\n\nAfter that the frightened little man talked. He spilled details of the Ingleside case, the San Francisco holdups, and the Oregon Express robbery. For his part in these crimes Brady was given a life term. On November 27, 1895, the great iron door of Folsom state pen clanked grimly behind him. But what had become of the fifty thousand dollars?\n\nBrady felt so sure that a detective had discovered the money that he stubbornly refused to go into details about it. All he would say was, “ I guess you fellows know where to find it.”\n\nIn prison, however, he took a liking to the warden and told him what he knew. The warden arranged for Brady to be taken to the Sacramento River, under guard, and the prisoner pointed out where the fortune had been buried. Officers dug feverishly. They found nothing but an empty Wells Fargo sack.\n\n“Do you think Browning doublecrossed you?” a detective asked.\n\nBrady shook his head.\n\n“He couldn’t. We never left each other’s sight.”\n\n“Do you think some farmer living near here may have come upon the hiding place by chance?”\n\n“Mebbe. Who knows?”\n\nFor months, detectives shadowed all the farmers in that vicinity. They checked up on bank balances, mortgages, house improvements, and the like, but found no evidence of sudden wealth. Finally Wells Fargo gave up the search and charged off the fifty thousand as dead loss.\n\nThen came an amazing sequence to the case of the bicycle bandits. Some time in 1896 a man who described himself as Baron von Hofen, a German nobleman, arrived in San Francisco on a liner from the Orient. He had letters of credit for large sums, opened checking accounts at several banks, lived in the Palace Hotel, and spent money like a drunken sailor. Reports said he bathed in champagne. Sometimes he paid in gold.\n\nWomen fawned on him. Blondes, brunettes, redheads. For one chorus girl, Mary Williams, he was said to have bought three thousand dollar’s worth of jewelry. And while he was guzzling champagne, he disclosed a very important secret. Later, he regretted very much having told her.\n\nThe baron’s downfall came when police recognized among his expensively dressed friends a man whom they had known but a short time before as a ragged hobo. They arrested and grilled him.\n\n“I don’t know where the baron got his money,” said the prisoner. “I don’t know nothin’.”\n\nMary was then pulled in for questioning. Her regal gems were just too dazzling for a lady of the chorus. Mary lost her nerve and told everything. The lavish spender was not a baron at all but a former tramp known as “Dutchy.”\n\nHe had watched two men hide the Wells Fargo loot. As soon as they left, he had dug it up and started on a global tour that cost him forty-five thousand dollars. All he had left was a measly five thousand. This he turned over to the cops.\n\n“After all that excitement you need a change,” said the judge. “Five years in jail at hard labor!”\n\nThus ends the strange true story of Western bandits who robbed the Oregon Express and “galloped away” on bicycles.\n\n~ The End ~\n"

      "content_html": "Virtually fiddling his way to a full pardon from the State penitentiary, of  Huntsville, Texas, is the experience of Enrique Rosoplo, a Chilian artist and musician found guilty of the charge of stealing diamonds in El Paso. Rosoplo is nothing if not a sentimentalist, and his experience has taught him the part that music plays upon the human emotions.\n\nWhen he learned recently that Governor Pat M. Neff (28th Governor of Texas, from 1921 to 1925) was planning to make a visit of inspection to the penitentiary, he obtained permission from the warden to send to his old home in El Paso for his violin. For several days before the date set for the governor’s arrival, the convict spent all his spare time practicing his most appealing selections.\n\nOn the day of the inspection, Rosoplo asked for and received permission to play for the governor. The convict entertained for an hour, playing as he had never played before, and concluding with “Home, Sweet Home.” This was rendered with so much feeling that Governor Neff was much impressed. The convict then made his plea for freedom and received the promise of a pardon.\n\nAn investigation showed that Rosoplo was a noted painter and musician of Mexico, where he was well known to many persons of political and social prominence.\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Trouble at the Bungalow Investment Company\n  Van Crom’s Surprise\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nTrouble at the Bungalow Investment Company\n\nBradford Kerry, president and general manager of the Bungalow Investment Company, of Los Angeles, was in a bad way financially — thanks to a “sure-thing” stock tip that had gone wrong. His company, too, had one foot over the brink of ruin and a rollerskate on the other one.\n\nVery comfortable was Mr. Kerry’s bodily posture as he cogitated on this. He was leaning back in his swivel chair, his feet resting on an open drawer of his desk. A fat, expensive cigar was between his thin lips, and a favored bottle stood handy to his reach.\n\nWhat really concerned Mr. Kerry more than any financial trouble was the fact that he wanted to go fishing; spring fever was in his veins, but he did not dare to seek the wildwoods that he craved. He was afraid — afraid that in his absence one of the directors might go through his books.\n\nFishing, with Mr. Kerry, was a serious business of life. No one day’s jaunt to a near-by, fished-out stream would satisfy him. He wanted to get far into the mountains, to lose the world of business entirely for a fortnight. Local sportsmen quoted him as an authority on the art of deceiving the elusive mountain trout. Bitterly he cursed the stock market and his inability to take a vacation.\n\nBusiness had been bad, very bad, for some months. Given unlimited authority by the board of directors of the Bungalow Investment Company in a desperate effort to keep the company solvent, he had juggled its resources in a way that would have been the envy of a vaudeville performer.\n\nAs a matter of fact, at this time Mr. Kerry was the “company,” for, confident of his ability to pull things through, as he had done before, the board had turned most of the company’s available assets over to Mr. Kerry’s personal account, taking his notes in exchange. This was not strictly according to the letter of the law regarding the conduct of such companies, and it was kept under cover.\n\nAbstractedly Mr. Kerry ran his fingers through his mop of red hair — flaming red hair; then absently he puffed again at his cigar. The scowl deepened as he thought of the situation. This time, apparently, nothing could keep the firm from the rocks toward which it was drifting. Twice had it been necessary to postpone dividends, with a resulting decline in the price of stock. The trouble — Mr. Kerry knew all too well where the main trouble lay; in plain language, the company had bitten off more than it could chew.\n\nIt had gambled too heavily on the home-seeking instincts of people newly arrived from the East. Much land had it purchased, built standardized bungalows thereon, and disposed of houses and lots at a profit that would have made an Eastern real estate man turn a rich emerald hue in sheer envy. For the greater part these domiciles were sold on such low terms as ten per cent down, and one per cent a month; anywhere from eight to twelve per cent interest being charged on unpaid balances.\n\nThis was well enough — and the company had prospered amazingly in the past. But the board of directors had voted for expansion on a larger scale, and to purchase the McDonald ranch in the suburbs of south Los Angeles. There were six hundred and forty acres in this tract, and to acquire it the company had obligated itself for something over half a million dollars.\n\nOrdinarily this would have been all right, for it had been the boast of the company that it had sold an average of more than one bungalow a day. They had made good on this — up to six months ago.\n\nBut in the last half year, for some unexplainable reason, bungalows had become a drug on the market. The company now had exactly one hundred and twenty-seven unsold houses on its hands, and still more were being built — per contracts. Carrying this load was causing the foundations of the firm to wabble.\n\nThis explains why the directors had been glad to pass the buck to Mr. Kerry. And the latter worried. Reaching into his vest pocket for a bank book, he noted the balance therein. A trifle over twenty-five thousand dollars of the company’s money was deposited to his order.\n\nBut what good was it — he sighed bitterly at the thought — when interests and payments on contracts that must be paid on the nail and fell due within a fortnight aggregated a total of over sixty-thousand? And the assets of the company were already hypothecated to the limit. Money was abnormally tight, anyway, and it seemed impossible to raise any now that a psychological panic was upsetting real-estate values. These conditions have been set down herewith as the explaining causes of Mr. Kerry’s deciding to flee to other climes with what money he could reach.\n\nHis musings were broken into by the entrance of the office boy, who announced the coming of one Bill Hendricks, real-estate broker.\n\n“Show him in!” was the order. Hendricks entered the office, tossed his hat onto the desk, and announced, point-blank: “We want to buy the southwest hundred acres of the McDonald ranch.”\n\n“Oh, you do!” It was glad news to Mr. Kerry. “What have you got up your sleeve this time. Bill? Who you representing?”\n\n“Sh-h! That’s a secret. We’ll pay eight hundred an acre.”\n\n“The devil you will!” rudely exclaimed Mr. Kerry. “You know darned well that we paid over nine hundred.”\n\n“Sure!” Hendricks grinned broadly. “My clients also know that you are in a devil of a hole, and might he willing to listen to eight hundred.”\n\n“I’ll take it!” snappily retorted Mr. Kerry. “Cash — this week!”\n\n“Not a question about it. It’s ready when you hand over the deed.”\n\n“That’ll be to-morrow. I’ll call a special meeting of directors to fix it up regular, so there’ll be no comeback.”\n\nThis happened on a Monday. Tuesday evening the money subject to Mr. Kerry’s personal control had swelled to one hundred and five thousand dollars. Things looked better for the company — at present. But the future was still black.\n\nThen he thought of the private transaction of which the directors knew nothing.\n\n“Well,” he said, debating, to himself, “it’s a case of either myself or the company going up the flue, so by a unanimous vote of one the company is elected to hold the bag.”\n\nArriving at this pleasant decision, he locked up all incriminating data, and announced to the office force that he was to be absent from the office all the following day. That night he left for San Francisco. Arriving in the bay city Wednesday morning, he went directly to a large employment agency. Nearly one hundred men were lounging in the waiting room, and Mr. Kerry looked them over carefully, finally picking out one with flaming red hair the color of his own.\n\n“Would you like to make one hundred dollars?” he asked.\n\n“Quit your kidding!” responded the other, who needed a shave. He looked Mr. Kerry up and down, noting every evidence of his prosperity.\n\n“No kidding; I’ve got use for you. Look here, you have the same color hair that I have, and the same shade of eyes. Take it all around, you would answer a general description of me. Now, I’m in trouble with my wife — and I want to skip out. Understand? I want to make a clean get-away. I’ll give you one hundred dollars and pay all your expenses if you’ll agree to impersonate me for a while.”\n\nThe other grinned.\n\n“Bo, it can’t be done. You can’t fool a woman. I resemble you in coloring and height, but we ain’t no twin brothers, by a long shot.”\n\n“You don’t quite understand. I only want you to take my name, and sail for Honolulu next Sunday. Let everybody on the boat know that you’re Bradford Kerry, real-estate man, from Los Angeles. I’m away behind in my alimony, and my wife will put the officers on my trail. Then they’ll arrest you instead of me, and bring you back here. It’ll be a big joke when my wife sees you. She’ll bawl out the officers proper, and you’ll be released. To earn your money you must not deny your identity as Kerry when they arrest you. Just sit tight, and laugh at them.”\n\n“One hundred dollars for getting arrested in your place and letting you make a clean get-away? Huh!”\n\n“I’ll make it two hundred.”\n\n“You’re on! D’ye know, I had begun to think there wasn’t that much money in the world.”\n\n“All right,” smilingly said Mr. Kerry. “Meet me in the lobby of the Palace next Sunday morning at ten o’clock, and I’ll have your steamer ticket ready for you. Here’s twenty for expenses until then. That’s in addition to the two hundred. Come to think about it, better get a decent suit of clothes and a traveling bag — if you have none. Here’s fifty more.”\n\n“But I don’t quite like the idea of getting arrested.”\n\n“You’ll have to in order to earn the two hundred. Admit that your name is Kerry, and say no more. Just laugh at the officers, and let them bring you back to the coast. Then, when my wife sees the mistake the officers have made, she’ll throw a duck-fit. I’ll leave your trail wide open, and quietly disappear myself.”\n\n“Very good,” said the other. “I understand the scheme now. I’ll meet you Sunday morning.”\n\nAfter leaving this employment agency, Mr. Kerry made inquiries as to the whereabouts of several others. Two hours later he had located another redhaired man, and made the same bargain — with this difference: on Sunday this second man was to leave for the East.\n\nWell satisfied with these initial steps, and chuckling to himself, Mr. Kerry boarded the next train for southern California.\n\nOn Friday he entered the Los Angeles office of the Oceanic Steamship Company and openly engaged a stateroom on the Alameda, which sailed from San Francisco for Sydney, via Honolulu, the following Sunday afternoon. The next morning he visited the uptown ticket office of the Southern Inland Pacific Railroad and bought a ticket for New York, by way of San Francisco. He was scheduled to leave Los Angeles on a train that evening and connect with an east-bound train in San Francisco the next day.\n\nMr. Kerry had a slight acquaintance with the ticket clerk.\n\n“Going to remain long in the East?” inquired the latter.\n\n“Yes; indefinitely. Pleasure combined with business, you might say. But keep it quiet until to-morrow that I’m going. The president of the Pacific Bank expects me to go yachting with him to-morrow, and I’m going to leave him flat as the easiest way of getting out of it. He bores me to death with his stale anecdotes when he gets me cornered on his boat.”\n\n“Sure, I’ll keep it under cover,” agreed the clerk, thinking, meanwhile, that it was a hastily conceived excuse to cover something else — something big in a business way, perhaps.\n\nMr. Kerry had been very friendly, indeed, with the president of the Pacific Bank. Therefore, when Mr. Kerry had telephoned to him for one hundred thousand dollars to be sent over to the office of the Bungalow Investment Company, there had been no question. Sometimes, the president knew, the actual cash was handed over in a big deal, when either of the parties concerned wished the details to be unknown even to bank employees.\n\nThat evening the Northbound Limited carried Mr. Kerry in a private compartment. In San Francisco the next morning, after his leaving the Townsend Street depot, he left a blank trail as far as he himself was concerned. But of other trails there were a redundancy. Some people even went so far as to suspect Mr. Kerry of possessing a sense of humor.\n\nAt first, on Monday morning, when Mr. Kerry did not appear at the offices of the Bungalow Investment Company, no alarm was felt. At eleven, after unsuccessful attempts to reach him by telephone, the vice-president sent a messenger to try to locate him. By noon the vice president smelt a rat, and went to the Pacific Bank to investigate, for a large interest payment fell due that very day.\n\nThen the story leaked out, and the early afternoon editions carried front-page scareheads of Mr. Kerry’s disappearance with one hundred thousand dollars. Ironic comments were made upon Mr. Kerry’s philanthropy in leaving five thousand in the bank. But even figures had been one of his hobbies.\n\nThe clerk in the uptown office of the railway company, reading of this, telephoned at once to the vice president. The latter smiled grimly upon receiving the information that Mr. Kerry was bound East, and hastened to notify the authorities. A late extra that evening announced that the absconding official had been apprehended as his train pulled into Salt Lake City. He admitted his identity, the papers stated, but refused to talk for publication. Also, he waived extradition, and would be returned immediately to Los Angeles.\n\nSo far-so good, but when the redhaired man claiming the name of Kerry arrived from Salt Lake City on Wednesday in the custody of an officer, there was a crowd at the depot to meet him, composed, for the greater part, of minor stockholders in the Bungalow Investment Company. Some of the excited ones were in favor of violence, and the police reserves were called to escort the prisoner out of the depot. Some of the officers knew Kerry by sight, and were puzzled at seeing the stranger.\n\n“Why, this isn’t the Kerry we want,” spoke a sergeant to the Salt Lake officer. “Mighty good of your department not to wait for us to send a man after him, but there’s a mistake somewhere.”\n\nHe went on to elaborate the story of Kerry’s defalcation.\n\n“So this Kerry gink skipped out with one hundred grand,” broke in the prisoner, heatedly. “I thought those Salt Lake people were trying to run a rannygazoo on me when they sprung that, so I earned my money by making a noise like a clam. Golly, he slipped a beaut over on me, telling me he was trying to get away from his wife! I could sympathize with him there. He paid me two hundred to use his ticket going east, and to keep my mouth shut if I got pinched.”\n\nAs newspaper copy this was A-1 stuff, and the headline writers made the most of it. Then, further sleuthing established the fact that Kerry, while throwing this blind on his trail, had sailed for Australia. At least he had purchased a ticket for the antipodes. The Evening Eagle scored a beat by wirelessing to verify Kerry’s presence on the Alameda. He had evidently, the Eagle stated, made a miscalculation in the time it would take to bring the other man back from Salt Lake City. Ordinarily the Salt Lake officials would have held the man and waited for a Los Angeles officer to come after him. There had been cases when the department had been hard put to spare a man to make a like trip, and a delay of some little time had resulted. But as it stood, the Alameda was still halfway between San Francisco and Honolulu.\n\nThen the authorities received an answer to their wire. Kerry had been placed under arrest by the captain. So the frenzied stockholders sat tight and waited for the time to elapse that it would take to bring him back from Hawaii. The Great Northern was due to sail from San Pedro for Honolulu the next day, and a man from the sheriffs office was sent on her. This officer, by the way, was not acquainted with Kerry. Sixteen days later he returned with his prisoner.\n\nThis time the newspapers set their humor specialists to write the story, and they unanimously agreed that Mr. Kerry was a smooth proposition. Too smooth, in fact, for he had obtained a clean start of nineteen days on the authorities, and might by this time be in hiding anywhere between Honduras and Greenland.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nVan Crom’s Surprise\n\nFor years the Los Angeles Evening Eagle had been the joke of the newspaper game. Then Carl Bjorkman took it over. A stubborn, canny Swede, who had come to the United States with his parents when he was not quite two years of age, he had gotten his first job on a newspaper before he was twelve. Four years later he had graduated from office boy to cub reporter, from a foot job to the copy desk, and at thirty he had been assistant city editor on a morning paper in Los Angeles. Then his father died, leaving him considerable money, which had been made through pure luck when a worthless homestead developed into rich oil land.\n\nWith that Carl had gone into business for himself. The Evening Eagle was on the market — had been for some time — but no one else wanted to tackle such a hopeless proposition. With Bjorkman it was different.\n\n“New blood,” was his watchword.\n\nAfter subscribing to a good news service, worthwhile syndicate articles, and an expensive comic section, he began to boost the circulation of the Eagle by boldly attacking the rottenness of the city administration. Private detectives gathered information for him, while disgruntled politicians gave him still more. Rapidly, the Eagle passed one of the evening papers in circulation and was hot on the heels of the other, the Daily Sphere, when the Kerry story broke.\n\nAs a sort of heritage with the Eagle, when Bjorkman took it over, had come an old-time reporter by the name of Van Crom. On the Eagle in its rundown days he had been a star — at twenty dollars a week. As he was the best on the old staff, Bjorkman kept him on at the same salary, but shunted him off onto police-court routine, for he was a faithful, methodical plugger.\n\nTo the younger men he brought in, Bjorkman paid more money. This being pushed aside as a hopeless has-been hurt Van Crom more than a little, but he kept silent, for twenty dollars a week is better than nothing when one has a family to support. He was called old, but he was less than fifty. In the past years twenty dollars had sufficed for the needs of his family, but now he had been reduced to the most, pitiful economies. Each day he rode into town from the suburbs — a fifty minute ride with poor car service — for in his desire to own a home he had purchased a cheap one from the Bungalow Investment Company. He paid installments of twenty-two dollars a month, these payments including interest, taxes, and insurance. The future looked hopeless. Each month it grew harder and harder to meet the payments going, and even though he could keep them up, it would take nine more years for him to own the house.\n\nThings had come to a pass where he was forced to have more money. So he bearded Carl Bjorkman in his office.\n\n“Mr. Bjorkman,” he began respectfully, “I have a family to support, and would like a chance to make a little more money.”\n\n“Not a chance!” said Bjorkman, shortly. “If you aren’t satisfied — quit!”\n\n“I’m not satisfied. But I dare not quit. My wife is ill, and —”\n\n“I know,” said Bjorkman, interrupting, “you don’t have to wade through the old story. I’m in favor of putting a younger man on your job, anyhow.”\n\nDisappointed, humiliated. Van Crom passed out of the office with bowed head. He was sick at heart at his very helplessness. Making his way around to the reporters’ room in the police station, he slumped into the seat at his desk. Half an hour he sat there, and his thought finally strayed from what he considered the injustice of Bjorkman. Prompted by some subconscious thought, he began to concentrate on the mystery of Kerry’s disappearance.\n\nA little later he walked back to the office of the Eagle and again entered Bjorkman’s office.\n\n“Well?” questioned the latter. But his tone was mildly interrogative; he had lost his bad humor of an hour before.\n\n“You are trying to get a larger circulation than the Sphere, aren’t you?” Van Crom stated this more as a fact than as a question. “If you located Kerry and got an exclusive story — one that the other papers would have no inkling of until the Eagle appeared on the streets — would it help?”\n\n“It would,” admitted Bjorkman, displaying a little more interest “A clean scoop on an item of such tremendous local interest would just about be the finishing touch. Do you know anything?”\n\n“Not yet.”\n\n“Then, why take up my time?”\n\n“Because I want more money. Would you pay me forty dollars a week, and give me a chance at bigger stuff, if I get a clean beat, and let the Eagle get the credit of locating Kerry where the police have been baffled?”\n\n“I’d pay fifty dollars,” said Bjorkman, tapping his desk nervously with his pencil as he licked his lips and looked shrewdly at the other. “But I think you have been taking it in the wrist. Every paper in town is on its toes to locate Kerry. I have several of the cleverest men in the country working for me on the Eagle. How do you expect to succeed where they have failed?”\n\n“These men of yours are all young — and younger men, as a rule, have not made much of a study of psychology. Why, I warrant that not a one of them has even read Spencer — or, granting that he has skimped through, that he has not made a real study of the first principles of psychology.”\n\n“What of it?” was the blunt demand. “I’ve never read him myself.”\n\n“Fifty dollars a week, and a chance at big stories to the man who locates Kerry!” repeated Van Crom.\n\n“I have one religion,” frowningly said Bjorkman: “I always keep my word! If you think you can locate Kerry by using applied psychology, go to it. But I have my doubts, so don’t bother me again.”\n\n“I should like to have a few days off.”\n\n“Sure,” agreed the other.\n\n“Without pay,” he added cannily.\n\nSeething with his big idea, Van Crom left the office. Later he went up the street to the Daily Sphere building. From there he went around to call on the sheriff of Los Angeles County, an old friend of his. He was smiling as he finally boarded a car and went home to his wife. At home he carefully loaded a revolver and stuck it into a hip pocket. A clean collar and a toothbrush completed his arrangements for traveling, and he returned to the city. There, he visited a bank, where he withdrew his entire savings account — forty dollars in all. Then he used the street-car transfer he had so carefully saved from his return trip from his home, and rode down Fifth Street to the Southern Inland depot. He was seated in the smoker, frugally rolling a cigarette, when the next train pulled out for the San Joaquin Valley.\n\nIn the morning he alighted from the stage in front of the only hotel in Galena, an isolated town in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. What meager fame Galena held in the outside world came from the whopping trout reputed to be found in Galena Creek. But few sportsmen cared to hazard the trip, however, for Galena was far from a railroad, and the connecting road for the greater part was of the uncomfortable species known as “corduroy.” Entering the ramshackle hotel. Van Crom addressed the proprietor.\n\n“Is Mr. Gilroy in?” was his question.\n\n“No,” was the reply, “Mr. Gilroy went fishing early this morning.”\n\n“Fishing,” repeated Van Crom softly, and he smiled.\n\nRolling another cigarette, he selected the best chair in the dingy little hotel office and sat down to wait. At eleven o’clock a man, black-haired and wearing enormous, yellow-lensed horn-rimmed glasses, entered the hotel. He was laden with fishing paraphernalia. Van Crom examined him narrowly, studied his profile, then smiled again, inwardly.\n\n“Kerry!” he called out suddenly to the man’s back.\n\nInvoluntarily the man started, checked himself as he turned to look at the speaker, and continued across the office.\n\nVan Crom arose to his feet, shifted his gun to his right-hand coat pocket, and followed the newcomer.\n\n“Mr. Gilroy,” he questioned, “may I have a few words with you?”\n\n“Certainly,” was the reply, and the reporter noted a curious little tightening paleness around the lips of the man he knew was Kerry.\n\nIn a corner of the office Van Crom removed his hand from his coat pocket. In it he held the gun; he was taking no chances, for Kerry outweighed him by forty pounds.\n\n“The game’s up, Kerry,” he announced. “I’m taking you back to Los Angeles with me. Will you come quietly? Good job, by the way, that you did with the hair dye.”\n\n“Who in the devil are you? You’re making a mistake in identity. My name’s Gilroy. Say, you’re a newspaper man, aren’t you? Used to be on the Eagle. Where do you get this stuff of trying to arrest a man?”\n\n“Sheriff deputized me yesterday.” Van Crom showed the badge. “Are you coming back without kicking up a fuss? I know I have no authority in this county, but I’m going to take it, anyhow.” He shoved the revolver forward another two inches.\n\n“All right,” said Kerry submissively, his eyes glued on the gun, “I’ll go back with you. But it’s got my goat how you located me here, and recognized me.”\n\n“That,” said Van Crom, “was a matter of psychology. Here,” he displayed a pair of handcuffs with which the sheriff had supplied him, “hold out your hands.”\n\n“You win!” Kerry wilted absolutely, seemingly hypnotized by the revolver. Van Crom had done the right thing in showing the weapon, for Kerry was gun-shy. Otherwise he would certainly have shown fight, taking a chance on overpowering the smaller man and escaping to the mountains.\n\nOn the afternoon stage they started back to the railroad. There was no sleep for Van Crom that night on the train; he sat up watching his precious prisoner. His future and the future comfort of his family depended upon the bringing of Kerry into Los Angeles. The reward — strange to say. Van Crom had forgotten entirely about the thousand-dollar reward that had been offered by the board of directors for Kerry’s return!\n\nAt the Fifth Street depot in the morning he ushered his prisoner into a taxi and drove to the office of the Eagle. Straight through the editorial room he marched Kerry, into Bjorkman’s private office.\n\n“Here’s Kerry!” he announced; “get his story; don’t turn him over to the police until he comes through with the whole tale, and, for the love of Morpheus, let me get some sleep.”\n\n“Kerry!” exclaimed Bjorkman, “And with black hair! Shades of Diamond Dyes! But there’s no sleep for you. Van, until we get your story. Spill that psychology stuff you were ranting about.”\n\n“Well,” began Van Crom, “when Kerry sent out two red-headed men to lay false trails, I figured that he would change the color of his hair. Was I right? Then, the strongest point was that Kerry, who has lived all his life in Los Angeles, would have a morbid desire to read what his former townsmen were saying about him. Besides, from the local papers, he might glean valuable information as to how close the police were on his trail.\n\n“I have worked on the Eagle for twenty years, and watched the town grow from a small village. In that time I have come to know practically every business man in Los Angeles, knowing many of them intimately, their likes, dislikes, and hobbies. Kerry’s passion, I knew, was trout fishing. I began with that, together with the sneaking notion that, under another name, he would subscribe to a Los Angeles paper. So when I left you the other day I went into the circulation department and examined the list of recent out-of-town subscribers. I found nothing there, however, to give me a clue. But I still had faith in my hunch.\n\n“Next, I went over to the circulation department of the Sphere. A chum of mine works there, and he fixed it up for me to go through the new out-of-town list. There I noted the name of H. P. Gilroy, whose address had changed three times in the last two weeks. All three addresses were places in the mountains where there is good fishing. Why, do you know that as soon as I spotted those addresses, Gilroy spelled Kerry to me. So I took a chance, went to the last address sent in, and found him.”\n\nTo Van Crom’s surprise, Bjorkman had doubled up in a violent fit of laughter.\n\n“Wow!” he exploded, red in the face, “Wow! This is rich! The idea of going over to the office of my dearest rival to get Kerry’s address. Man, I love your nerve! And I’m going to print it, too — the whole story. Oh boy! but I’m going to rub it into the Sphere. You may call that stuff psychology, but I’d say it was the most beautiful example of enterprising gall that I have ever heard of.”\n\n“Do I get my sleep now?” queried Van Crom.\n\n“Sure. Hit the hay. I’ll get the story from Kerry.” He turned to the prisoner; “Going to come through with the yarn?”\n\n“What’s the use of doing otherwise?” returned Kerry, and he spat disgustedly as though to remove an offensive taste from his mouth. “After the story Van Crom just told of how he located me, I have such a small opinion of myself that I think I’d walk up Broadway in a bathing suit if it would please you any.”\n\nTHE END\n"

The young lady at Lawyer Starrett’s office had a message for him from New York — would he please come and get it?\n\nTerry had spent the entire morning in Starrett’s office, and he remembered the young lady … quite an attractive number. He went there at once.\n\nEven as he turned the handle of the door, a queer premonition held him. It was after two of a warm Saturday afternoon in August, and the entire building seemed empty. The elevator was not running; he had had to walk upstairs. He surmised that the message was from his chief, Lije Prentice, President of Mammoth Oil, and might be important.\n\nFinally he decided that the straw of the last few days had made him a bit nervous. A lot of people would have been immediately amused by that idea, people who had seen the black-haired thunderbolt in action. Whenever there was trouble, the Mammoth Oil Company called for, its general utility man, its Mr. Fixem, Terry Bradford.\n\nNevertheless he opened the door cautiously and peered in. It occurred to him that the message might have been left on Starrett’s desk in his private office, the door of which was closed. Suddenly impatient with himself, Terry strode across the long room and threw the door open.\n\nA masculine falsetto called, “Come in, sweetie — pie!”\n\nHe sprang back and reached for the forty-five under his coat — and as quickly stopped. Suicide did not appeal to him.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Patent Assignment and the Plans\n\nThere were two men in the small office, and the window-blind was down. Their guns pointed straight at him. One, who sat behind Starrett’s desk, was a big fellow with meaty shoulders and a moon-like face. His right ear was a cylinder; the hand which held the gun was huge. The other, standing against the wall, was dark, slender, immaculately dressed in a gray suit à la Broadway. There was a significant sureness about the way he held his weapon in a smooth brown hand.\n\nThe big fellow said jocularly, “Come in, Mr. Bradford, dew come in! The dame said to apologize for not keepin’ the appointment. Didn’t she, Harry?”\n\nHe seemed to be enjoying himself hugely.\n\nHarry said unsmilingly, “Yeah!”\n\nHe closed the door behind Terry.\n\nHe said, “Hey, pull up that blind a few inches, Marty. It’s hot as hell in here!”\n\n“Sure, sure!” Marty complied. “Terry ain’t gonna holler and disturb the neighbors, are you, Terry? He ain’t that dumb — from all I hear he’s a real smart guy!”\n\nWithout replying, Bradford seated himself close to the desk and watched them through alert gray eyes.\n\n“See, he’s gonna be nice!” approved Marty. “Why the hell should he get hisself bumped off for some oil company that don’t give a damn about him? What does a good-lookin’ guy like him wanna get slugs through his belly for? He’s got too much sense. Don’t he look like any who’s got sense to you, Harry?”\n\n“He’d better have!” said Harry.\n\nBradford said coolly, “I’d like to get my cigarettes out of my pocket, if it won’t make you bozos nervous.”\n\n“He wants to smoke,” Marty commented. “Do you think it’s good for him to smoke, Harry?”\n\nHarry seemed to consider. “No, better not. Cigarettes might stunt his growth.” His diction was better than Marty’s.\n\n“In what reformatory did they preach that to you?” asked Bradford quizzically.\n\nThe big fellow laughed with great glee. “Say, he must know your family, Harry.” He scratched his nose with his gun-barrel, and Terry wished fervently that it would go off.\n\nHarry commanded grimly, “Stand up, Bradford! Raise your hands–now turn around and face the wall.”\n\n“You been a bad boy!” explained Marty. “Teacher is gonna punish you.”\n\nFor an instant Bradford toyed with the idea of a swift snatch at the little fellow’s gun, followed-by a blow to one of several vulnerable spots whose location he knew. But he abandoned it. For all his frivolity, the big fellow was alert, his gun steady. Reluctantly he raised his arms and turned about, tensing involuntarily for the blow that might come. But Harry only reached for the gun under Terry’s coat, and threw it on the desk in front of Marty.\n\nWith a bear-like left hand, Marty picked it up, opened the cylinder, and glanced at the lead noses of the cartridges reposing there. He snapped the gun shut. Bradford sat down again.\n\n“Got two rods now!” Marty remarked. “I certainly could ruin you, Bradford, if you got me peeved. But you wouldn’t do that, would you? Get poor old Marty worked up in this hot weather? Just come across with that sketch and the — the — what do you call it?”\n\n“Patent assignment,” suggested Harry. “No, we don’t want the assignment — he hasn’t got it anyhow–it’s the plans we want.”\n\n“Yeah, them — and then we’ll all go in swimming! It’s too nice to stay in this office on a scorcher like this, or” — -his face suddenly became grim — “in a morgue.”\n\nHarry added to that: “So bring out those things before we begin working on you, Bradford.”\n\n“Now look here, you wise guys”–Bradford pretended to lose patience — “you’re talking screwy. What patent? What plans?”\n\n“He’s callin’ us names,” chided Marty, “and us so nice to him — thinkin’ he’s a right guy. Should we slug him first and then search him, Harry, or visey-voisey?”\n\n“Marty isn’t fooling,” admonished Harry. “He’s a good-natured guy, but when he’s crossed he gets mad — and the next thing you know, there you are in an undertaker’s back room, giving work to unemployed embalmers!”\n\n“He looks tough,” admitted Terry mildly.\n\n“I’m no angel myself, but Marty’s got no heart at all. Don’t be a sap, Terry — there are other jobs but you’ve got only one life. Come across with the plans — I happen to know you mailed the patent assignment.”\n\nBradford understood. If they got the plans, whoever was behind them would manufacture a similar gadget, and take a chance on fighting it out with the Mammoth on an infringement suit.\n\n“Those plans,” Bradford stated, “were mailed to Mr. Elijah Prentice in New York.”\n\n“Quit trying to kid us!” Harry’s smile was complacent. “This morning you got the plans and the patent assignment from Bruce Kingsberg’s lawyer, right here in this office, and you gave him a check for two hundred and fifty grand. Then you called old man Prentice and he told you to mail the assignment, but bring in the plans yourself. Now do I know what I’m talking about? Come across and stay healthy, Bradford — I’m speaking to you like a pal.”\n\nMarty commented admiringly, “Ain’t he got the gift of gab, Bradford? I always tell him he shoulda been a mouthpiece. You kin see he’s dead right, can’t you? He’s talkin’ for your good, sweetie — pie.”\n\n“How would you like to go to hell?” Bradford was irritable. “You’d make a swell comedian — up the river.”\n\n“I was there!” bragged Marty pridefully. “I played on the football team — right guard. I was good, too! Ask anybody.”\n\nThey were certainly well-informed; Bradford wondered where they had obtained such accurate information. A leak somewhere. Arranging the trap in the very office where he had consummated the deal that morning was fast work. And neither of these two looked as though he had any more conscience than a weasel, and no more aversion to killing.\n\nThere was no doubt in Terry’s mind that McMahon of the Benton Motor Company was their employer. The stake was a huge one, and McMahon was not one to be deterred by scruples. Those patent rights and the plans had cost Terry’s company a quarter of a million dollars, but they were worth millions. He remembered how it had all come about.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Invention\n\nSome weeks earlier, a letter had come to the New York office of the Mammoth Oil Company signed by one Bruce Kingsberg, of Springfield, Massachusetts. In it the writer stated that he had perfected and patented an invention which would enable automobiles to travel two hundred miles on one gallon of gas.\n\nIt was turned over to the company’s representative in Springfield, with instructions to interview the writer and report immediately. In a short time the reply came that Kingsberg’s invention seemed capable of doing just what he claimed. Also, and what was more serious, that the inventor had also written the Benton Motor Company for a bid.\n\nAt once Bradford was dispatched to Springfield with a skilled engineer. The engineer confirmed the report already received, and the matter was then referred to Elijah Prentice.\n\nThat invention might mean the loss of millions annually to the oil company; the laying off of thousands of men; general ruin and havoc in the industry. Kingsberg’s contrivance could be used not only in automobiles, but in any type of gasoline-driven motor. It would curtail the use of gasoline fifty to sixty per cent.\n\nSo Bradford was sent back to Springfield with a blank check. And just about the time he was through negotiating with Kingsberg, the Benton Motor Company descended on Springfield like a wolf on the fold. The Benton’s interests lay on the other side of the fence from the Mammoth. With this patent, every car sold would have to pay a royalty to the Benton Company. A contrivance that would enable a Benton car to run two hundred miles on one gallon of gas was worth anything the inventor asked.\n\nThe Benton Company’s representative quickly persuaded Kingsberg’s lawyer that his client was not being paid enough for so valuable a patent. The lawyer advised Kingsberg to break his agreement to sell to Mammoth. But Kingsberg, a Canadian, happened to be the sort of man who believed in the sanctity of a promise, written or verbal. To him the price he had agreed to accept was ample. Disregarding his lawyer, he went through with the deal and sold out to Mammoth.\n\nRight up to the last minute, all kinds of pressure had been exerted on Kingsberg by the Benton Company’s representatives … even threats of violence. But these only made the Canadian more resolute. And so that morning the final papers had been signed and executed in the office of Kingsberg’s lawyer, and delivered to Bradford in exchange for the firm’s check.\n\nOld Elijah Prentice had told Bradford over the telephone substantially what Harry had quoted: “Mail in all the papers, including the patent assignment, Terry — everything but the plans. Those are too valuable to be sent by mail — bring them in yourself. And watch your step. McMahon wouldn’t stop at murder to get them.”\n\nBradford had promised grimly, “I’ll bring them in, Chief — don’t lose any sleep worrying.”\n\nIt seemed safer to go home by train; Bradford had decided that in a car there would be the risk of a holdup or an accident.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Desperate Plan\n\nWell, he just hadn’t been careful enough. It looked very much as though curtains would shortly be rung down on the exciting career of one Terry Bradford, trouble-shooter for the Mammoth Oil Company. But if he felt any fear, he didn’t show it.\n\n“So you got the information that I’m carrying those plans back myself?” His laugh derided them. “You really think they’d trust them to me, instead of to the United States mail? Old Lijah foxed you, that’s all — and you fell for it. Those papers are all In the mail. You’ re barking up the wrong tree.”\n\nThe man called Marty turned a questioning look on his accomplice. But Harry shook his head.\n\n“He’s lying, Marty. I’m going through him. If he hasn’t them on him, he knows where they are … We may have to get rough with this baby. Here, you, stand up and turn around.”\n\n“Sure, sure!” Bradford stood up and stretched his arms. “I suppose getting rough with me is going to get you the sketch, isn’t it?”\n\n“Shut up!” ordered Harry without heat. He went through Bradford carefully, even forcing him to remove his hat and shoes.\n\nThen, “Take your coat off,” he directed, and Bradford obeyed. With two swift rips, Harry tore the lining away from the inside.\n\nBradford said bitterly, “That suit cost me fifty bucks, you heel!”\n\nHe was facing Harry again.\n\n“Heel, am I?”\n\nHarry was suddenly enraged. His upper lips drew back from his teeth, fang-like. “Gabby guy, aren’t you? They’ve been telling you you’re tough until you got to believe it. Well —\n\n“Swing your toe into the seat of his pants!” advised Marty.\n\n“Hell with that!” crackled Harry. “Let’s quit fooling around: Where are those papers, wise guy?”\n\nHis gun-barrel dug savagely into Bradford’s stomach. Death glinted in the dark depths of his blazing eyes.\n\nMarty said ominously, “Better talk quick, teller!”\n\nHe had Bradford’s gun on his lap; his own pointed at Bradford’s heart. “It’s easier to frisk a stiff than a live one.”\n\nA lethal silence hung in the close, heated air. From the street below came the sound of traffic; the August sun drove hot rays through the cracks in the shade and whitened the window-sill beneath it.\n\nA plan took tenuous form in his mind … a desperate plan, with all the odds against success. But he decided it was worth a try. If it failed he wouldn’t be there to worry over it.\n\nHe said with apparent reluctance, “All right, you win. The plans are in my grip at the hotel. I was coming back for them in time to make the four-ten train to New York.”\n\n“At the Brunswick? That where you left it? In your room?” Harry jabbed him again.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What’s your number? Where’s your key?”\n\n“Room number 565. I left my key with the hotel clerk.”\n\nMarty said, “Aw, you don’t need his key,” and pulled out what looked like a cylinder with a buttomhook attached.\n\n“Here, Harry, you know how to use this can-opener, don’tcha? I’ll keep this mug here till you come back!”\n\nHis light blue eyes had begun to redden.\n\n“If those papers ain’t there, I’m going to blow your head off, teller! I feel like doin’ it anyhow! You got a nerve callin’ Harry a heel!”\n\nHarry said, “I’ll be right back!” and went out.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nPaper Wad\n\nAll the false jocularity had disappeared from the gunman’s face. His eyes held no more mercy than those of a hungry tiger.\n\n“Turn around! Sit down!” he snarled. “Unless you want to go for me! Come on, try it! I heard you was tough. Where’s your guts?”\n\nOnly one man to tackle, now, thought Bradford. Swiftly his mind revolved and discarded one expedient after another.\n\nHe said with his disarming smile, “All right; I know when I’m licked. I’m no glutton for punishment. You’re on top and you’re getting what you’re after. What the hell more do you want? Give me a cigarette.’\n\nMarty threw over a cigarette with his left hand.\n\n“If we get it …”\n\nHis tone was significant. “If we don’t … well, they’ll find you here on Monday, but you won’t look so nice.”\n\nBradford demanded, “What’s McMahon paying you for, to bump me off or to get that sketch? Will he take the rap for you when it comes time for you to burn!”\n\nHe loosened his collar and tie; it was hot.\n\n“Hell, you shoot your mouth off too much!”\n\nBut now there was less rage and more amusement in the crook’s voice.\n\n“Don’t worry about what we’re gettin’. He’s payin’ us enough. We ain’t no pikers, Harry and me.”\n\nThere could be no further doubt of the intentions of these two men. They meant to kill him as soon as they had the plans.\n\nMarty had admitted that McMahon was paying them because, reasoned Bradford, there could be no harm in making such an admission to a man who would not be alive to tell tales.\n\n“You go clear if you give up those plans,” offered Marty. “All we want is to get them, give them to McMahon and get our dough.”\n\nBradford knew he had to act quickly. The Brunswick Hotel was only three blocks away, and Harry would be back any minute. He would come back with empty hands, because the papers were not in his grip. Bradford visualized the paroxysms of rage and the swift finish — with himself as the victim.\n\n“Listen, Marty,” he began quietly, “I want to give you a friendly tip. You remember calling on Kingsberg, the inventor, and threatening him? It was you, wasn’t it? Sure! He’ll be able to identify you if anything happens to me. There’s nothing against you in this transaction yet–at least nothing but threatening Kingsberg, and that don’t amount to much. But if you rub me out — “\n\nNow the gunman was his jocular self once more, and as nasty as a fly in a bowl of soup. “S’pos’n I do? I ain’t sayin’ I will, but s’pos’n I do? How’ll they know it was I done it? There’s a lot of other guys would bump you off for less’n we’re gettin’. Who’d know Harry and I done it?”\n\nBradford puffed at his cigarette and reached across for the ashtray. He said scornfully, “First thing, Kingsberg would go through the picture gallery, and he’d have to be blind not to recognize you, having seen you at his house. Then again–have you ever heard of the science of ballistics? They’ll find that gun of yours and — “\n\nMarty interrupted, “Jeeze, but you are a dope, ain’tcha? Why couldn’t I bury the gat somewhere — get rid of it? What kind of a sap do you take me for? Or — hell, I don’t even have to do that!”\n\nHe put his gun down and picked up Terry’s — the very thing Terry had been hoping he would do.\n\n“How ‘bout my pluggin’ you with your own gun? Suicide! You was in love with some gal here in town, maybe — and she give you a standup and you committed suicide!” He chuckled self-approvingly. “Say, that’s a good one, too, ain’t it? You won’t be around to say it ain’t so!”\n\n“Oh, hell, I suppose you got me!”\n\nTerry rose dejectedly and put his hands into his pockets. The gun in Marty’s hand followed him, and Marty’s eyes were alert, his lips twisted into an amused sneer as though he suspected Terry intended to attack and was quite ready to let him commit self-destruction. Terry strolled forward a step.\n\nAt the corner of the desk, Terry turned and faced Marty. He began, “Listen, Marty …”\n\nThen he threw himself forward in a fierce, lunging dive — one hundred and ninety pounds of mauling ferocity.\n\nHis fangs showing like a wolf’s, Marty pulled the trigger of Bradford’s gun. A futile pop resulted. Yelling hoarsely as Terry struck him, Marty dropped Terry’s revolver and tried to pick up his own. But now Terry’s fists smote him in the softness between chin and collarbone, and abruptly the big fellow went limp. To make doubly sure, Terry banged him over the head with his own forty-five, scooped up the other gun, and stepped away. Marty slid half off his chair, and Terry let him lay. The gunman was out cold.\n\nHis eyes on the door, Terry grabbed the telephone. In another moment he was speaking to the Springfield chief of police.\n\n“Hiyuh, chief — this is Terry Bradford! I’m in Starrett’s office on Abington Street, suite 404. Got a prisoner for you — attempted murder and a couple of other things. His side kick is due here any minute … . What? Yes, I’m all right now, bu’ I wasn’t a little while ago. Say, I really ought to duck this bird that’s coming here … got no right to take chances with what I’m carrying … only I happen to be sore at him for ruining my coat.\n\n“The fellow I have here is one of the two who threatened Kingsberg — remember? They tried to finish me off … . I just happened to be lucky. Hurry over here, Chief!”\n\nHe put down the instrument and ran out, closing the door of the inner office behind him. He raced through the outer office, into the hallway to the elevator shaft, and pressed the button several times. Then he remembered the elevator hadn’t been running when he came.\n\nTo his ears came the sound of footsteps climbing up the stairs. He went back into the outer office and stood to one side of the closed door.\n\nA moment later the door opened almost noiselessly. He could see Harry’s form through the opaque glass. Harry carried a suitcase — Terry’s.\n\nSilently Terry rose behind him. The butt of his revolver came down with a vicious swing over the gunman’s ear. Harry staggered sideways, his knees started to buckle. Then he folded up like an accordion. Terry let him fall. He straightened him out and went through the inert form with expert fingers, removing a gun and a blackjack. Opening the suitcase, he put Harry’s weapons into it. He stuck Marty’s gun into his own pocket … he might need it.\n\nIt was a quarter of three, still almost an hour and a half short of train time. He made up his mind he would spend that hour and a half in the police station. He had no right to take any more chances with those plans.\n\nThen, smiling to himself, he drew out the cylinder of his own forty-five. All the cartridges were intact. And Kingsberg’s sketch, made on tissue thin onionskin paper, had been rammed into one of the cartridge cases — after it had been emptied of powder. That cartridge case had been one bullet removed from the firing-pin. Marty’s shot had been ineffective because when he pulled the trigger, the firing-pin had fallen on a paper-wadded cartridge.\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "Time to Practice\n\nIn Los Angeles recently, Vernon Bronson Twitchell had the unique opportunity of studying his own book behind bars. The author of Living Without Liquor, Twitchell began a 6o-day sentence for drunken driving. Police said it was the 32nd time he had been arrested for drunkenness.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nSquealer\n\nWashington, D. C. police, tracking a $650 robbery, visited the home of James Morgan to question him. Vehemently he denied all knowledge of the money. The police were just leaving when the tea kettle began to whistle. An alert officer lifted the lid — and found the stolen money floating on the boiling water.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nRepeater\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Pa., Morris Lebovitz, lost a 1953 Cadillac by theft. Eventually, tired of being car-less, he bought a 1954 model. Several days later the new car was stolen, and the old, in excellent condition, was left in its place.\n\nThis time police found the culprit, Clarence Bailey, 26, who had stolen both cars.\n\nHe was sentenced to two to six years in the penitentiary.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nMatrimonial Antics\n\nIn Los Angeles a man arrested for marrying four separate females in less than twelve months declared aggrievedly: “I had to have something to do on my days off!”\n\nIn Knoxville, Tenn., a husband sued for divorce on the grounds that his wife wrote a song entitled Thirty Months in Hell just to describe their marriage.\n\nWhile in Hartford, Conn., police entered a restaurant to arrest for non-support a part-time piano player, Paul H. Scott, 34, and found him playing his heart out. The song he was beating out on the ivories was I Wish I Was Single Again!\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nBargain\n\nHarvey Thompson, waiter at The Barbecue Pit in Dallas, Tex., knows a good offer when he gets it. Threatened by a holdup man who gave him a note reading, “Give me forty dollars. If you don’t have forty, give me ten,” Thompson handed over $10 and kept the change.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nWilling Victim\n\nA Nashville, Tenn. newspaper printed a letter from a convict aged 21, serving five years for robbery, who declared that he was anxious to marry “any widow, regardless of age, so long as she has enough money to educate me and knows the governor well enough to get me a pardon.”\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nFutility\n\nAtlanta, Ga. burglars, escaping with a safe containing $5000 from a supermarket, successfully loaded it onto their truck. But as they drove off, the safe slid down onto the pavement where it remained for the police.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nImitation Rigor Morin\n\nA suicide using a gun may unintentionally mimic rigor mortis in the fingers only — provided he keeps a tight hold on the revolver. For some unknown reason a cadaveric spasm may occur which makes the hand stiffen tenaciously onto the weapon, while the rest of his body remains limp. Normal rigor mortis, affecting the entire body, will not reach the hands for at least two hours after death.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nBlue Law Bandit\n\nA grocer in Yuma, Ariz. is being forced to close his store on Sundays against his will. Twice a masked robber has taken $6,000 from store owner George Spurling. Each time the bandit, operating on week days only, tells Spurling the robberies will continue “as long as you stay open Sundays.”\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nFragrant Hideout\n\nAnother grocery store in the Southwest, this time in Dallas, Tex., was found by several squad cars answering an alarm to have its back door wide open. After a fruitless search of the place, officers were about to leave when Police Sgt. Ted Cain and Detective T. T. Lord lifted the lid of a garbage can. Crouched moistly inside was the 19-year-old burglar.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nFriendly Custom\n\nPolice in Knoxville, Tenn., were instructed by Mayor George Dempster never to swear when making arrests.\n\n“A man,” the mayor told them, “ought to reserve profanity for his friends and not just spread it around.”\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nSleepytime Boys\n\nIn Seattle, Wash., a frustrated citizen trying to guard against burglars reported to police that he locked and bolted his door, hid $40 in his sock, and wore the sock to bed. In the morning the sock was still on his foot, but the $40 was gone.\n\nGerald Blanchard, of Marinette, Wis., confessed to police in Marquette, Mich, a unique method of picking his hotel robbery victims. Blanchard, a beauty shop supply salesman, listens for snores. There’s a certain rhythm, he insists, that makes it safe to enter for an overhaul of billfolds and purses.\n\nAnd in Inverness, Calif., Vadim Turkan fastened the doors of his grocery with heavy chains and went to bed in the back room. Neighbors were awakened when burglars took off the chains and fled with 19 cases of beer before the police arrived. Turkan slept on.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nMonkey Business\n\nOfficers Johnny Coles and Jim Harp of Tulsa, Okla., arrested M. L. Sharp for illegal possession of whiskey, then couldn’t find the liquor in the house. But a search of the back yard revealed a pet monkey in an old chicken coop, playing with a full half pint. Near him were 16 more pints.\n\n“That damned monkey,” Sharp groaned, “Last week he broke 12 bottles.”\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nFemale of the Species\n\nAn odd “crime” occurred in Liege, Belgium, one afternoon in January, 1911, when Auguste Clemond, wealthy widower, summoned police after the death of his only daughter, Marie. She had been engaged to a law clerk, Raymond Hamelle, but was fiercely jealous of his affection for her more attractive cousin, Jeanne.\n\nSeveral nights before her death, Hamelle had promised to come to discuss wedding details, but when he failed to arrive by 9 p.m., Marie dashed furiously out into the storm. Two hours later she returned soaked and shivering. Pneumonia set in, and as the end drew near, her father sent for Hamelle. Until three in the morning the young man watched beside her bed, then told M. Clemond that Marie had sent him away, asking her father to come instead. Alone with her parent, Marie, barely able to whisper, told him just before she died that Hamelle had opened her jewel case and stolen a diamond.\n\nInvestigation revealed that Hamelle had courted Jeanne until won over by Marie’s money and her vigorous pursuit. Jeanne swore that although Hamelle had not seen her since the engagement, Marie was mad with jealousy and constantly spied on her. It was also revealed that Jeanne was next of kin since her cousin’s death, and under the will of Marie’s grandfather would inherit the family property. Marie had died suddenly. Was it possible, police wondered, that Hamelle was guilty of murder as well as theft?\n\nAn autopsy gave the answer. Contents of the viscera revealed not a trace of poison — but within Marie’s stomach was the missing 7- carat diamond, swallowed in a deathbed revenge by the jealous girl.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nAn Ounce of Prevention\n\nIn Dallas, Tex., arresting a man who had slugged his wife with a sledge hammer, police learned from him that she “always got cranky” when the weather was bad. So, fearing another twister because of a threatening sky, he told them he had forestalled a scene by bopping her over the head and sending her to the hospital.\n\nTHE END\n"

Judd’s gray eyes were bleak.\n\n“What the devil is the matter with you?”\n\nLaurette whirled on him.\n\n“Why should anything be the matter?”\n\nSomething sure as hell is. You’ve been wound up like a two-buck watch for the last few days.”\n\nLaurette didn’t answer. The soft curves of her full, rounded figured like quicksilver beneath the red-panelled black crepe hostess gown. His wife’s pantherish beauty could still do things to Judd even after these six years of virtual isolation, with only Laurette for company. But her present attack of the fidgets really bothered him.\n\nHe watched her pour in inch of whiskey into her half-empty highball and drain the glass.\n\nHe said, “You’re not worrying about Tony, are you, angel?”\n\nShe banged the empty glass hollowly on the table.\n\n“Sure I’m worried. Anybody but a dope like you would be too.”\n\n“Take it easy,” he said. “Tony couldn’t find us in a million years.”\n\n“But if he did — “\n\n“Forget it. He can’t. We’ve moved a half a dozen times these past six years. We’ve covered our tracks every step of the way. Who cares if he’s out? He wouldn’t even know where to start looking.”\n\nLaurette glared at him and reached for the bottle again. Her nervousness began to get through to Judd. For the first time doubts began to stir in his own mind. He thought he had hidden his tracks so that Tony could never find him. But how could he be sure?\n\nIt was not a pleasant thing to think about. Six years ago he and Tony Marko had pulled a payroll job back East. The caper had blown up in their faces. The guard had shot Tony in the leg, anchored him there for the cops to grab. Judd had finished the deal, taking a cool hundred thousand plus away with him. But he had killed the guard in doing it.\n\nThe outcome had had its good points. Laurette had been Tony’s girl, but she had weighed Judd’s hundred grand against the prospect of starving while she waited for Tony, and the hundred grand had won out.\n\nAll during her trial she and Judd had watched the papers, wondering if Tony would sing. He hadn’t. Apparently he was willing to ride the rap alone on the chance that Judd would protect his share of the take.\n\nJudd had smiled about that at the time, when it became apparent how Tony’s mind was working. Tony was still a kid then. He probably really expected Judd to stick by him, keep his fifty thousand all packed up in cellophane and ready to hand over whenever Tony slipped his bonds.\n\nInstead, Judd had spent those six years carefully cutting off every possible trail that could ever lead Tony Marko to him. He had married Tony’s girl and taken Tony’s fifty thousand with him, and he had no intention of ever letting Tony get a look at either of them again. He and Laurette had holed up in Chi, in Mobile, in Dallas. Now they were in California, in a lonely mountain house far above the tiny village of Esperanza.\n\nAnd Tony Marko was out. With a game leg, the newspaper had said. The guard’s bullet had done a permanent job.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Angry Night\n\nTHE angry night wind whirled around the top of the mountain and rattled one of the living room windows like a dog worrying a bone. Judd swore at it under his breath and put down his paper. He crossed the room and threw the window open, working to jam a piece of cardboard back between the loose frame and the sash.\n\nA sound reached his ears and he froze. He knew without turning that Laurette had heard it too.\n\nThe car was already half way up the tortuous mountain road. Judd could practically pinpoint it by the sound of the laboring motor, fighting against the steep grade and the corkscrew turns. There were few houses below this one, and none above. Judd listened, his heart rumbling in his thick bull-like chest.\n\nHe strained to hear, to read the message the gusts of wind were carrying up to him. Laurette was standing close now and for once the heady perfume she wore meant nothing to him. He was listening to that car motor, listening and figuring.\n\nIt would be passing the canyon house three miles below about now. That was the last house short of Judd’s. He waited for the motor to die. It kept coming, slowly, steadily.\n\nLaurette’s gasp at his shoulder was tight and strangled.\n\n“He’s a stranger, Judd! He shifted to second! He doesn’t know the road!”\n\nThe back of Judd’s neck began to ache. He and Laurette often laughed at how easily they could tell whether the few cars that climbed the dangerously narrow road were driven by natives, just by following the sound of the motors echoing back and forth between the mountains.\n\nBut Judd was not laughing tonight. He remembered how he too had been frightened at first by the deep canyons which gaped at either side of the road. It had been months before he had dared make the drive in anything but second and low.\n\nThe motor he was listening to now was telling him something, as clearly as if it could speak. It was telling him that the driver of that car had never driven this road before.\n\n“It’s Tony,” Laurette whispered. “I know it is.”\n\n“Damn it, it can’t be Tony! There’s no way he could trace us, no way at all!”\n\nShe didn’t seem to have heard him. He stared down into the canyon again, saw a shaft of light move hesitantly across the face of the opposite mountain and disappear. The motor whined on, louder now.\n\n“It’s somebody from the village,” Judd said. “It must be. Get away from the window so he won’t think we’re watching for anything.”\n\n“Stop giving me orders, Judd. I — “\n\n“Get away from that window!”\n\nLaurette flopped defiantly on to the couch and crossed her legs. Her pale blue eyes, hard and bright beneath her soft chestnut hair, met Judd’s. He sat down and picked up his newspaper again but it lay flat and unnoticed in his lap.\n\nMinutes passed. The car came closer, its motor protesting. Another shaft of light flared in the front window as the automobile turned the final curve, slowed down.\n\nJudd made a dive for the big table, yanked out his gun.\n\nThe car motor coughed into silence. The door opened and closed. Feet shuffled on gravel, then footsteps sounded hollowly on the wooden stairs leading up to the porch.\n\nThe tightness at the base of Judd’s neck spread into his shoulders, down his back. He stared at Laurette horrified, not daring to believe what he heard.\n\nA heavy step, then a lighter one. Heavy. Light. A man climbing the porch stairs, one step at a time.\n\nA man with a game leg.\n\nJudd clutched the gun in his coat pocket and watched the door, fascinated. He counted the steps as though hypnotized, the two sounds for each step. Then an uneven scraping on the porch.\n\nThe rasp of the buzzer set a million tiny needles in motion, jabbing at every inch of Judd’s big frame. He walked slowly to the door, his hand in his coat pocket. The doorknob was wet as he turned it.\n\n“Hello, Judd,” Tony Marko said.\n\nHe wasn’t the way Judd remembered him. He had been a big, happy blond kid when Judd had picked him up. He had owned a smile that paid off, a smile which had worked miracles on the jury that had tried him. The smile was still there today, but it was an imitation now. It was as though somebody had taken an impression of Tony Marko’s face as it used to be, and then chiseled a copy of it out of unpolished marble.\n\n“Hello, kid.” Judd’s mouth felt crammed with gauze. “Come on in.”\n\nHe saw Tony’s eyes travel to Laurette. The girl’s lips showed dark red on a face drained of color.\n\n“It’s been a long time, beautiful,” Tony mocked. He limped into the room, the game leg stiff and useless, and sank heavily into Judd’s chair.\n\n“Drink, Tony?” Judd said.\n\n“Why not?”\n\nHe made the highball in the glass Laurette had been using. Laurette didn’t notice. She and Tony were staring at each other. He saw Laurette’s mouth working as though she were trying to think of something to say.\n\n“How did you find us?” Judd asked casually.\n\nTony accepted the highball and sipped it. He seemed completely at ease.\n\n“You didn’t cover your tracks as clean as you thought,” he said. “I didn’t have too much trouble.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nTony Demands His Cut\n\nJudd stiffened. He had expected Tony to have some definite answer rigged up. Instead Tony was dodging the question.\n\n“We were planning to contact you, kid,” Judd said. “Soon as you had been out a little while. We just didn’t want to stick out necks out too soon so the cops would get a lead on us. That wouldn’t have helped anybody.”\n\n“Sure,” Tony said. “I know.”\n\n“How did you get out so soon?” Laurette found her voice.\n\n“Soft-hearted parole board,” Tony said. “And the witnesses, bless ‘em all, who saw it was Judd who killed the guard, not me.”\n\n“Maybe there’s more to it,” Judd said thinly. “Maybe they sprung you so they could follow you and see what happened.”\n\n“Don’t worry. Nobody followed me here. I didn’t sweat out those six years just so I could turn my fifty grand back to the cops. I’m not dumb, you know.” He looked up and his smile vanished. “I’ll take that fifty now, Judd.”\n\nJudd saw Laurette watching him. The gun was a hard, reassuring lump in his pocket. But he couldn’t kill Tony. Not yet. It was still possible that the kid had tracked him down to put the finger on him. There still might be police breathing down his neck, no matter what Tony said. He had to stall, try to find out more.\n\nIt never occurred to him to give Tony his share and forget about it. He couldn’t afford to. Laurette was in his blood now and Laurette cost money. There wasn’t much of Judd’s own fifty thousand left after these six years. With Tony’s split gone, Laurette would vanish, too.\n\n“It’ll take time, kid,” he said.\n\n“How come?” There was steel in Tony’s voice.\n\n“You can’t pull that kind of money out of a hat, at a moment’s notice. Some of it’s in the bank down in Esperanza, most of it is in Los Angeles banks. I can get it, sure, but I can’t pull every cent all at once. That would be a skull play for both of us.”\n\n“The real skull play,” Tony said, “would be for you not to get that dough all at once. I told you a minute ago that I hadn’t led to cops to you. That don’t mean I can’t change my mind if you get any ideas about crossing me.”\n\n“Who’s talking about crossing anybody? I’m just trying to explain — “\n\n“Suppose I do a little explaining, chum. Everybody back East knows I didn’t kill the guard. The murder charge is still wide open. Up to now I haven’t tied you in because I wanted my cut. But if I don’t get it. … “ He snapped his fingers. “You’re through. Really through.”\n\nJudd swallowed. Laurette was watching him too and he tried to avoid her eyes.\n\n“All right,” he said finally. “I’ll get as much as I can tomorrow. I can drive down to L.A. in the morning and pull some of it. Maybe not the whole fifty at one time — “\n\n“Make it close to fifty. Six years is all the waiting I intend to do.”\n\nJudd nodded. “Where are you staying? Down in Esperanza?”\n\n“That’s right.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“What difference does it make? I don’t mind driving back up here for a haul like this.”\n\nJudd smiled grimly. “Those five-hundred foot drops don’t seem to bother you much.”\n\n“I can handle the road. Don’t worry about it.”\n\n“It’s still no good. I’d rather bring the stuff to your place. The fewer cars come up that road and stop here, the better.”\n\nLaurette said, “You’re crazy, Judd. It’s just as dangerous for you to be seen too much in town.”\n\n“What’s the address?” Judd broke in.\n\nTony shrugged.\n\n“It’s a rooming house at Thirty-Seven Obispo Street. My flat is number five. What time will you be there?”\n\n“Let’s say eleven tomorrow night. Okay?”\n\nTony pulled himself to his feet. “Okay,” he said. “Nice to know you protected my slice for me, Judd. I figured I could count on you.”\n\nHe hobbled out without looking back. His game leg banged unevenly on the outside stairs, then the car pulled cautiously away for the tortuous drive back into the valley.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Stall\n\nAs the sound dimmed Laurette whirled on Judd.\n\n“What’s the idea of the stall?” she demanded. “What’s with that story about the money being in banks? You’ve got every cent that’s left right here in this house.”\n\n“Tony doesn’t know that.”\n\n“I still say it stinks. The guy served your time for you and kept you clean.”\n\nJudd’s hand tightened around her arm and twisted. Laurette glared at him and bit her lip.\n\n“Whose side are you on, beautiful?” he muttered. “I thought you had smartened up by now. Or maybe your memory’s short. Maybe you’re forgetting that when I picked that kid up, he was nothing but a garage mechanic pulling down a lousy twenty bucks a week.”\n\n“Six years in the stir — “\n\n“It’s still cheap for what he stands to get. I’m not holding out on him. I’ll take him the dough tomorrow. But I’ve got to protect myself too. If I had given him the stuff tonight, he could have taken it back to town, sent the cops up after me and beat it. Think I’m nuts?”\n\nLaurette squirmed out of his grasp and went upstairs. Judd watched her thoughtfully. It was a full hour before he followed her. There were a lot of things he had to think about.\n\nOne of the most important was the question of how Tony had trailed them. And Judd was pretty sure he knew the answer to that. It was why he had taken the trouble to get Tony’s address in town. Maybe Laurette had known before where Tony would be holed up. Now Judd knew it too.\n\nA fog settled over the mountain top during the night and the next morning broke damp and sticky. Just before lunch Laurette said, “I’ll be going down into town this afternoon.”\n\n“What for?”\n\n“I have an appointment at the beauty parlor.”\n\nJudd thought back. It was just three days ago that she had been to the beauty parlor last. She probably thought he wouldn’t remember.\n\n“Okay,” he said. “I’ll drive you down.”\n\nLaurette hesitated.\n\n“I don’t mind going alone.”\n\n“Forget it. I’ve got some things to do in town anyway. We’ll go together.”\n\nShe left it there. After lunch Judd drove down through the fog bank which clung to the mountain like damp wool. He dropped Laurette at the beauty parlor and said, “What time will you be ready?”\n\n“Couple of hours.”\n\nJudd was practically certain now. Her calmness was forced, too forced.\n\n“Pick me up at four thirty.”\n\nHe nodded and drove off. He turned right at the next corner, right again, and parked. He walked two blocks, keeping an eye out for Laurette, and found himself on Obispo Street.\n\nThirty-seven looked like any of a dozen other rooming houses spotted about the village. Judd walked past the doorway and looked in. He saw nobody. Most people living in a place like that would be out to work this time of day. He mashed out his cigarette, glanced up and down the narrow street again and ducked inside.\n\nHe paused in the entryway, listening. Somebody had a radio tuned in to a soap opera in one of the first-floor rooms. It was the only sound he heard.\n\nHe found room number five at the top of the stairs, but he passed it without knocking. Instead, he tried the one unnumbered door in the hallway. It was a linen closet. He slipped inside and waited. The soap opera from the downstairs flat was a mumble which rose and fell indistinctly. But Judd could still hear it. The doors and walls seemed to be paper thin.\n\nHe didn’t have long to wait. Twelve minutes after he arrived, light footsteps clicked hurriedly up the stairs. There was a sharp rap at number five Judd waited till the door opened, then he risked a look.\n\nThe girl was Laurette, but she didn’t notice him. She was too busy throwing her arms around Tony Marko and crying, “Tony, darling!”\n\nTony said, “It’s been a long time, baby,” and drew her inside. The door clicked shut.\n\nAnger coursed inside of Judd like molten metal. He crept to the door and listened, his hands wadded into iron fists in his pockets. He could hear Tony and Laurette as clearly as if he were in the room himself, and after a few minutes all of his own questions had been answered.\n\n“I was wondering if you would be able to get away today,” Tony said.\n\n“Don’t worry,” Laurette laughed. “I’ve got Judd wrapped up tight. He’s still crazy about me.”\n\n“I can understand that, baby. Has he caught on yet that you were the one who tipped me off where to find him?”\n\n“He hasn’t said anything about it.” The laughter went out of her voice. “But I think he does know, Tony. He was so sure you’d never get a lead. He’s bound to figure it that way.”\n\n“Don’t let him scare you,” Tony said. “He won’t be on your neck any more, once I’ve got my cut.”\n\nJudd wanted to tear the door off its hinges and smash it over Tony Marko’s head. He fought to keep still so he wouldn’t miss anything.\n\n“You can’t trust him,” Laurette said. “He lied about the money being in banks. He’s got it in the house, what’s left of it.”\n\nTony muttered something. Laurette rushed on, “You can’t trust him, darling. If he comes here tonight, he won’t bring the money with him. He’ll be planning to kill you.”\n\nAnd then Judd heard what he was waiting for.\n\nTony said: “He won’t kill me. And he won’t bother either of us again after today. By eleven o’clock tonight, Judd Kaniler will be dead.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe kid was doing him a favor\n\nJudd didn’t wait any longer. He had his answer now, and he knew that if he staved there another minute he’d break the door down and blow his top. The stakes were too high for a move like that. He was ahead of Tony now, way ahead of him. It would be simple to handle the deal from here on.\n\nHe got out of the neighborhood, being careful to avoid any streets which could be seen from Tony’s window. He went back to the car and sat there, thinking, planning.\n\nServe Laurette right if he snuffed her out the same time as Tony. But it wasn’t the way Judd planned to play it. He still wanted Laurette around, even if she had ratted on him. And the strange thing was, he knew she would stick with him once Tony was out of the picture. He knew her after six long years, knew her money-crazy mind inside out. With Tony gone and Judd still holding over fifty thousand in cash, she’d stick. Judd was positive.\n\nTony was the only one to worry about. Tony had said Judd wouldn’t be alive to keep that appointment at his flat at eleven that night. That meant he’d be coming up to Judd’s place on the mountain some time earlier in the evening, on some pretext or other. A killing in that remote spot might not be discovered for weeks.\n\nJudd smiled grimly. The kid was doing him a favor.\n\nHe picked Laurette up in front of the beauty parlor and pretended not to notice how nervous she was on the long drive back up the mountain. He made the run in high, and for once Laurette was too pre-occupied to be scared of the hairpin turns and the sharp drops. She chain smoked, staring straight ahead and saying nothing.\n\nAfter dinner Laurette said, “What time will you be going down into Esperanza to see Tony?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Judd said easily. “Ten-thirty maybe. That would give me plenty of time.”\n\nThe girl made herself a stiff drink and turned on the radio. Judd said, “Cut it off, angel.”\n\n“Why? They got some good shows on tonight.”\n\n“Turn it off and keep it off. I feel like reading.”\n\nHe could see her watching him, trying to figure if he was on to what was coming. He ignored her glance and pretended to read a magazine. He wanted no radio, no conversation — nothing which could prevent his hearing any car which climbed the mountain. The window which had been rattling the night before was thrown wide open tonight.\n\nLaurette set up a card table and tried to concentrate on solitaire. Judd watched her make a dozen misplays but he said nothing. The ashtray she was using filled up in no time with red-tipped cigarettes, mashed out with only a half inch smoked away.\n\nHe was watching her when he heard the car. He saw her grow rigid, and the card she was holding dropped to the table top. Judd remained motionless. The car was moving in second gear, somewhere in the canyons below. Then the motor died and the silence of the night closed in again.\n\nJudd frowned slightly. That could have been someone turning in at the house three miles below. He couldn’t be sure. He held his breath, straining to hear. He heard nothing.\n\nIt was five minutes past nine.\n\n“For Pete’s sake!” Laurette burst out. “Can’t I have some radio now?”\n\nHe shook his head. Laurette shuffled the deck of cards on the table and went back to the kitchen for another drink.\n\nThe clock dragged to nine-thirty, then ten. Judd began to tighten up, the way he used to do before a big job. He wanted to have a drink himself but he held off. The chips were down tonight. And Tony Marko no dope.\n\nIf the blasted kid would only show! Judd was ready for him. His gun was in his pocket again, and he was set for anything Tony could throw at him. But there had been no more cars since the one which had died out into silence miles below …\n\nA gasp of bad air ripped from Judd’s straining lungs. He had heard the noise from outside the house. And at the same instant he knew what was happening. The other car had been Tony’s. Tony had finished his trip on foot. He was outside now. Outside this house. Maybe his gun was leveled at Judd right this minute, through a window … .\n\nJudd rose to his feet and moved as quickly as he dared toward the cellar door.\n\nLaurette glanced at him sharply and he mumbled, “Don’t like the way the furnace is going.”\n\nHe wondered at every step if he’d hear the crash of a shot, and he swore at himself for not figuring Tony’s plan.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nYou Killed Him\n\nHe reached the cellar door and exhaled sharply. He closed it behind him and felt his way down, not daring to turn on the light. But he didn’t go all the way into the cellar itself. He climbed the opposite stairs and opened the slanting doors to the clear star-filled night outside. His right hand was damp around the cold handle of his gun.\n\nHe waited, then leaped out and crouched in the shadows, letting the door drop noiselessly into place behind him. No telling where Tony Marko was now. Somewhere out here in the darkness, sure. But where?\n\nCarefully he moved forward, hugging the wall. He strained his eyes at the clumps of flowering shrubs which rustled gently in the wind. Any of them could conceal a man, a man who had waited six years and traveled two thousand miles to kill him.\n\nHe ducked around the corner and flattened himself against the house. The stone facing was cold at his back and his lungs ached again. Slowly he crept on, waiting, searching … .\n\nThen it happened. A figure appeared suddenly around the corner of the garage, a tall figure silhouetted against the gray night.\n\nTony Marko.\n\nThere was a strangled cry. Judd’s gun coughed the night’s stillness. Tony staggered back and sprawled into a shapeless heap against the back of the garage. Four bullets smashed into the body of Tony Marko. And when the mountains had swallowed up the noise, Tony Marko was dead.\n\nThe back door flew open and Laurette rushed out. Her eyes glowed wildly in the darkness.\n\n“You killed him!” she screamed. “You killed him!”\n\nJudd’s throat was hot and dry. He grabbed the girl and shook her like an animal.\n\n“Snap out of it,” Judd shouted. “It’s over now.”\n\nLaurette was going to pieces and Judd knew there was no time to lose. Somebody might have heard those shots down in the canyon. He dropped the gun in his pocket and swung hard with his free hand. His fist cracked against Laurette’s jaw and she immediately went limp in his arms.\n\nWorking fast, Judd dragged her into the garage and dumped her into the front seat. He threw Tony Marko’s body into the back. Laurette would stay out long enough for him to get half way down the mountain and throw what was left of Tony into a canyon. It might be months before the corpse would be discovered and maybe by then it would be too late for any positive identification. Laurette could be handled when she came to. If she couldn’t — then she could always be taken care of the same way Tony had been.\n\nJudd hurried into the house long enough to grab the remainder of the original hundred thousand. He tossed it in the car, leaped in himself and kicked his motor into life. He was glad he had always made a habit of garaging his car backwards so that he could head out in a hurry in any emergency.\n\nLaurette Scathed heavily at his side as he roared out of the driveway and started down the mountain. For the first time he felt safe. Tony was dead. The last person outside of Laurette who could ever finger him for that killing back East was out of the way. He still had the money, and even more important than that, he still had Laurette … .\n\nHis face blanched as he realized he was moving too fast. There was a curve ahead, the first hairpin turn with a vertical drop into nowhere. Judd’s feet slammed the brake pedal.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nA Wide, Black Pool\n\nNothing happened. The car bowled forward, gaining more and more speed by the second.\n\nSuddenly Judd’s whole body went limp with horror. His feet pumped impotently at a brake which was not there. He grabbed at the emergency. It was a loose piece of metal in his hand. The brakes had been gimicked.\n\nIn one blinding instant Judd realized what had happened. Tony hadn’t come up that mountain to shoot him. Tony had been a garage mechanic when Judd had picked him up. He had a weapon even better than a gun, for a man who was planning to drive a car down the mountain to keep an eleven o’clock appointment. He and Laurette would wait for the crash to tell them Judd was dead, then they’d grab the money and escape in Tony’s own car.\n\nJudd’s face was a mask of terror. He tried to jam the gears into second but it was too late. He wrenched at the wheel as the curve drew closer. Laurette groaned and rolled over against him.\n\nThe tires squealed and gave. Judd screamed.\n\nThe canyon yawned beneath him like a wide, black pool — a pool which had no bottom.\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "Three juries voted and the public said, “Let it drop!”\n\nNow that more than thirty years have passed, can you explain the murder of the Belle of Mount Vernon? Why was she killed? Why was such a weapon used? Who killed her?\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nBroadway is no older than its butterflies; no longer than the list of these beautiful young girls, whose dancing feet have at last become entangled in the dark ways of crime. Like Dot King and Louise Lawson, her latter-day counterparts, Dolly Reynolds fluttered awhile in the bright lights before she met a violent death.\n\nOn the morning of August 16, 1898, the front pages of New York newspapers were devoted to Dewey’s capture of Manila, and the murder of Dolly Reynolds in the Grand Hotel at Broadway and Thirty — first Street. Who killed the pretty twenty-one-year-old daughter of a respectable Mount Vernon family, and why, was to puzzle private citizens, detectives, and district attorneys for many months.\n\nAt nineteen, Emelyne Reynolds, nicknamed Dolly, was the belle of Mount Vernon. She was beautiful and she loved pretty clothes, jewelry, and champagne. A willing New York broker was on hand to provide her with these commodities. And it was not long before Dolly decided to leave her father’s house and live in New York. Her ambition ran toward the stage, but in the meantime she pursued the less glittering profession of book agent. When Dolly returned on visits to the parental rooftree, she often drove up in “a stylish trap.” Her clothes were fashionable. And there were rings on her fingers.\n\nBut father and mother Reynolds were simple, unimaginative folk. They wondered a little how Dolly could afford to buy these things, and maintain her luxuriously furnished flat at the corner-of Ninth Avenue and Fifty-eighth Street, and why she preferred to be known at that address as “Mrs. E. C. Reynolds.” But she had always been an independent young woman and they did not question her too closely; they were only glad that the book business was so good.\n\nIt is doubtful if the beautiful brown-haired book agent ever sold many sets of “The Literature of All Nations,” in ten volumes. But she learned a lot about the prices of diamonds, lobsters and champagne.\n\nDolly Reynolds had the combination of avarice and stupidity which usually characterize Broadway’s gay moths. And it was the prospect of making a fortune by a dubious race-track scheme that took her into the Grand Hotel on that hot August noonday.\n\nCarrying a black shopping bag tucked under the pink arm of her shirtwaist, she told the desk clerk that her husband would join her later, signed the register, “E. Maxwell and wife, Brooklyn,” and was assigned to Room 84, on the fourth floor. Miss Reynolds then ate her luncheon in the hotel cafe and went out. About 5:30 in the afternoon, she returned accompanied by a tall, dark man with a black mustache. And shortly thereafter a pint of champagne and two glasses were delivered on order to Room 84.\n\nAt 7 o’clock, “Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell” went out, returning about midnight. Patrick Lenihan, the night elevator man, took them up to the fourth floor. At about 2 A. M., Lenihan was mildly surprised to see his mustachioed passenger descend the marble staircase alone — and leave the hotel. Night clerks have reason to be particularly interested in guests who walk out at such ungodly hours, and from behind his desk John Gregory took a good look at the departing profile.\n\nNothing more was seen of the occupants of Room 84, until 10 o’clock the next morning, when, after repeated knockings, the chambermaid entered it.\n\nOn the floor, between the center table and the lounge, lay the body of a young woman — her head in a pool of blood. The horrified maid gave the alarm. When the police arrived on the scene they discovered a curious weapon on the floor near the dead woman’s head. It was a foot length of lead pipe, crooked at one end, and wound with tire tape at the other. An iron rod had been fitted into the bore at the taped end. Bloodstains showed on the tape where it had struck the victim’s head, breaking her neck. She was fully dressed.\n\nThere were no signs of a struggle, except for a turneddown stocking, the loosened buttons of her shirtwaist, and the fact that the lobe of one ear was torn, as though an earring had been unceremoniously removed.\n\nOn the mantelpiece was a black shopping bag. An unknown hand had been in such haste to get at the contents that, rather than fumble with the catch, it had ripped a slit through the leather side.\n\nFrom cards and papers in the bag, detectives learned that the dead woman was not Mrs. E. Maxwell of Brooklyn, but Mrs. E. C. Reynolds of 370 West Fiftyeighth Street, from which address Dolly’s colored maid  was brought down to the Grand Hotel, where she identified her mistress’s corpse.\n\nWhen the body was being prepared for the autopsy a bunch of bank notes and a check were discovered underneath the corset. There was only $9.00 in money, but the check was for $13,000. This slip of paper interested Captain McCluskey, chief of the Detective Bureau, exceedingly. It was drawn on the Garfield National Bank, payable to Emma Reynolds, signed by Dudley Gideon, and endorsed on the back by S. J. Kennedy.\n\nDown at the bank on Sixth Avenue and Twenty-third Street the cashier informed the detectives that they had no account with a Dudley Gideon, but they did have a depositor named S. J. Kennedy. He was a dentist, with offices at 60 West Twenty-second Street. When the handwritings were compared, the signature of the endorsement tallied exactly with that of the respectable dentist around the corner.\n\nDetectives then sought Kennedy at the oflice where he and his father practised dentistry together. The doctor’s answers were so contradictory, that he was conveyed to the Teni derloin Police Station, where hotel employees identified him as the man who had come to the Grand Hotel with Miss Reynolds — and left it , alone. None of Kennedy’s three different accounts of his movements on the night of the murder was satisfactory.\n\nHis wife and baby being in Massachusetts, he said he had gone to Proctor’s Theater alone, but didn’t remember any of the acts on the stage. His story of how he then went home to New Dorp, Staten Island, where he lived with his parents, was an incriminating tangle of ferry-boats which didn’t land where he said they did; rides on trolley cars whose conductors denied his presence that night, and a four-mile woodland walk, that would have daunted a veteran tramper.\n\nFinally, Dr. Kennedy fell back on the time-worn excuse, “I don’t remember.” Except for the fact that he had put on a new pair of socks, and drunk one cocktail in the office, the dental mind was an abysmal blank from 5 o’clock Monday afternoon, until 7 o’clock the following morning, when he remembered being awakened in their New Dorp home.\n\nPieced together fragments of paper found in the waste basket, matched pages in Dr. Kennedy’s prescription pad. The words “E. Maxwell and wife, Brooklyn,” written on it, tallied with his handwriting. Thus, said the detectives, had he instructed the young woman to register. The incriminating check was a form long discarded by the bank, and a book with the same kind of blanks was found in the doctor’s home.\n\nA piece of lead pipe which exactly fitted that of the murderer’s bludgeon, and bore corresponding cutting marks of a vise, was discovered in the Kennedy cellar. With the same deadly precision, an 8-inch dark stain on the inside of his right trouser leg, and on his newly purchased underdrawers, fitted the mark that such a piece of lead pipe would make if carried hooked on the drawers’ belt. And what was more natural than tire tape in the tool kit of so ardent a bicyclist as the doctor?\n\nOnly one link was missing. The hotel employees agreed that the man they saw, had worn a straw hat, and although it was proved that Kennedy had bought a new straw hat on the afternoon of the murder, ‘it could never be found.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\t\n\tDr. Samuel J. Kennedy, a Jekyll and Hyde of real life.\n\n\n\n\nWhy a man like Dr. Kennedy should have chosen that brutal weapon puzzled even the police, and led some people to believe that the murder had been committed by a desperate burglar. It was a thug’s billy. And a robbery had taken place in the hotel that night. Also there were the woman’s missing 3-carat earrings and rings worth several thousands of dollars. But the jewels came to light some time later, on a pantry shelf in the Ninth Avenue apartment, although detectives had previously searched the place; a wakeful woman who had occupied a room directly below number 84, further destroyed the “burglar on the fire escape” theory, and Dr. Kennedy was said to have kept even more sinister company than Dolly Reynolds.\n\nThe police were interested to learn that he had been emulating the famous firm of Jekyll &amp;amp; Hyde. The devoted father, and respected citizen of New Dorp, was also a familiar figure in New York’s tenderloin, and a heavy plunger at race-tracks. He was said to have previously invested money for the Reynolds girl, giving her the worthless check as her share of the winnings. Presumably, Dolly went to the Grand Hotel to hand over more capital, since four days earlier, she had drawn $500 from her Mount Vernon savings account, telling her mother that she was going to meet Dr. Kennedy on Monday. He had told her to bring this sum in a satchel, she said, and he would have more money to put in it. Why her partner in beating the horses did not simply deduct the $500, if he really had further profits to give her, apparently never crossed her mind.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\t\n\tThe notorious room --- 84 of the Grand Hotel --- as seen by a contemporary artist.\n\n\n\n\nThe police version of the real reason for that fatal appointment was that Kennedy took the girl to the hotel for the purpose of recovering the tell-tale check, whose presentation at the bank would mean his discovery as a forger. Failing to extract it by any other means, he had killed her. The slit bag, unbuttoned shirtwaist, and turned-down stocking, indicated that he had looked for it — but those search-proof corsets of the nineties had beaten him.\n\nDr. Samuel J. Kennedy was brought to trial for the murder of Emelyne Reynolds, before Justice Williams, in the Criminal Branch of the Superior Court, on March 22, 1899. His defense was a complete denial of the murder charge, and the handwriting on both check and memorandum. His lawyers produced numerous character witnesses from New Dorp, including the pastor of St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church. A rather vague woman testified that she had seen him in the Staten Island ferry-house at a crucial hour on the night of the murder.\n\nHis weeping wife, and his 72-year old father, both took the witness stand and denied that the handwritings in question were Dr. Kennedy’s. All in vain. A level-headed jury listened to the iron-clad evidence presented by the prosecution, including a surprise ear-witness, who testified that from her hotel room directly beneath that occupied by “E. Maxwell and wife,” she had heard at 11:50 on the fatal night, the footsteps of two people, then the thud of somebody falling, and later only one person walking around the room. And after three hours deliberation, the twelve men brought in a verdict of guilty of first degree murder.\n\nDr. Kennedy’s lawyers immediately began to work for a new trial, and in February 1901, this was begun. After it had lasted several weeks, the jury found themselves unable to agree. The State then decided to hold a third trial. Handwriting experts now testified both ways. And it was not surprising that after three years, some of the witnesses were dead, and others contradicted themselves. There were those among the jurors who felt that the prisoner’s identification was inadequate. Others thought the motive was insufficient, and the murder not premeditated. Kennedy’s good reputation in his home town impressed them.\n\nAfter twenty-one hours, they were still unable to agree, standing eight for acquittal, and four for conviction. And on June 16, 1901, a third jury was discharged and Dr. Kennedy was released on $10,000 bail.\n\nDolly Reynolds had been ornamental, but her life had not been that prescribed by moralists, and she was dead, whereas Dr. Kennedy was a live and useful member of society. He could still pull teeth. And that, said the dentist, was exactly what he intended to do in the sanctity of New Dorp, “as soon as he was rested, and had gotten his tools and materials in orderf’\n\nThe surety was released in February, 1903, and about a month later the indictment for murder in the first degree was dismissed, leaving the man who had once spent twenty-one months in the death house at Sing Sing wholly free to cast his life in pleasanter places.\n\n~ The End ~\n"

According to the story told by Howard J.

Those of us who knew this weird, narrow, and sometimes deep stream, would’ve had trouble, despite our familiarity with the countryside, locating Joseph P. Casson, had it not been for some duck hunters. Bold adventurers they were, meriting admiration.\n\nIn the first place the immediate vicinity of the sluggish yellow stream was practically untenanted of human beings — but the ground was fairly littered with wild creatures, and the water — aye, there was something for you. Predatory fowl, mud turtles, pertinacious moccasins and, incidentally, some of the biggest catfish you ever saw, inhabited Big Saffron. Stunted trees, some cypress and some dwarfed swamp oak, gave it almost a perpetual shade; and if the sun ever shone on the creek or on Water Moccasin Slough (the latter being one of the principal tributaries of Big Saffron), it was never surprised doing it. Along the banks were decayed tree-stumps like you find rotten teeth in the gums of some negligent old person. Vines clung to the sodden earth, with horseweeds and rank, colorless grass growths. Occasionally a predaceous fowl flapped away with a live fish wriggling in its back, or an unseen, furtive animal crushed dry sticks in flight. Or summer ducks fled tree high.\n\nNobody ever understood Big Saffron, but that was because nobody ever went to the trouble of exploring it. That is — not in late years. The creek began on Lafe Martin’s three hundred acre farm, six miles due south of Mason City; it ended somewhere in the Mississippi River, as though it hadn’t been meant to travel very far, and had only a sinister purpose to serve in this world. It was like a river in Hades, or as this writer would imagine such a river to be —  one drink of its water would kill a normal human being — a one way river, fit only for the devil’s navigation. The stench on this humid, sticky day was so sharp as to draw tears from your eyes; the smell of gumbo, rotting weeds, decomposed fish and animals, and above all, the bitter acrid stink of deteriorated human flesh. Southeast Mississippi sweltered under a flatiron heat.\n\nThere was small wonder that buzzards soared over us, their long, featherless necks craned out full length, their projectile shaped bodies making dark blurs through the open branches of those Satanic trees. But the funniest part of it was the way the dead man’s bier was a mound of burlap bags completely covered with rat poison.\n\n“Why didn’t they throw him into the creek?” asked little Sheriff Homer Custard. “Why go to all the trouble of piling those gunny-sacks under the body?”\n\n“At least they took precaution to see the corpse was protected from beasts and buzzards,” I said. “But —  let’s get out of here as soon as possible.”\n\nSquire Pete Grately, the richest banker in Mason City, lashed his mud besmeared plaid breeches with a looped horseweed.\n\n“What killed him?” he grunted.\n\nI could understand his wheezing and grunting. He was fat, tall, and his bay window always made me think of the legendary or mythical Paul Bunyan’s enormous chest. Forty eight inches of belly. Close-cropped irongray hair, a jutting chin, a short, red, corpulent neck; dark copper spotted skin, bags under the eyes. It seemed his head had outgrown his skin, and his body had crowded nature’s suit to the bursting point. He was in his shirt sleeves; his blatant plaid coat was folded over his left arm. A black Homburg had been pushed to the back of his cranium.\n\n“Cause of death?” I peered up at him, stuck the point of a red pencil (which I afterward threw away) against a blue hole in the back of Casson’s head.\n\n“A 22-rifle in the hands of a slow, deliberate killer.”\n\n“There goes that damned FBI stuff again,” Grately admonished, turning to the skinny little sheriff. “Why don’t you stop sending Indian George to them criminology schools?”\n\nSheriff Custard grinned. “Because this county want to keep up with the new methods the FBI schools are inaugurating to make murder a lot more unprofitable than it’s ever been before.”\n\nThe acrimony in Custard’s voice belied the expansive grin on his face.\n\nThe banker coughed.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Strange Whistling Sound\n\nSuddenly I heard a strange whistling sound, not exactly a whistle, not a tune, but a whistler who was imitating something like a creaking wheel. It puzzled me. and I guess it puzzled the banker. I saw him cant his head to listen.\n\nThe sheriff whipped round, stared off through the trees. However, I knew nothing but blue haze met his probing eyes.\n\n“Never heard anything like that before,” Custard said. “Must be a strange bird. You recollect the duck hunters said they heard someone whistling just before they found Joe Casson? I wonder — “\n\n“Sure, but they didn’t see who it was,” I said.\n\nSweat gleamed on Grately’s face.\n\n“Let’s be moving,” he said uneasily. “Let’s be getting out of here. You want to stay here all day? Indian George has looked around for footprints and other clues, without finding anything. Doesn’t this about wind us up?”\n\nThe sheriff turned to me, blinked his blue eyes and said, “See if you can locate the bird that done that whistling. Then come on over to Lafe Martin’s. We’ll truck the body over there for the inquest.\n\nSilently I faded off into the blue gloom.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nLooking for Signs\n\nBut I didn’t find the whistler.\n\nNor did I hear the sound again.\n\n“That’s a weird bird,” I said to myself. I thought I’d heard all the birds that frequented our country, but that was a new one — if it was a bird. I bent over, kept my eyes on the soggy earth. No prints. There wasn’t a solitary footprint —\n\nOh but there was, too. I saw definitely where the weight of a body on solid leather heels had crushed twigs an inch in diameter into the slush of mud. Encouraged, I bent my best efforts to the task, found other signs barely visible to the naked eye. Someone had stood here and moved about, and over beyond the footprints I observed thin wheel tracks, the width of the steel tires were less than those of a common lumber wagon, yet they weren’t buggy tracks. Maybe a buckboard.\n\nWell, here was one for the books. Knowing Big Saffron was shunned by the neighboring farmers, that only rarely did a duck hunter venture here on his way to Giant Lake a mile west, the wheel marks and footprints bothered me. I wasn’t quite sure there wasn’t a whistler, that the duck hunters were fooled by the sound. But as carefully as I searched I was unable to follow the trail of the phantom vehicle beyond a narrow rutted lane at least half a mile from Big Saffron.\n\nAnd when a Sioux Indian can’t find such evidence, I can tell you right now it can’t be found. And that’s another one for the books.\n\nI thought of young Joseph Casson, how he’d come back from the war to inherit his father’s estate, after being given up for dead in the Pacific. Lafe Martin’s rural empire wasn’t Lafe Martin’s any more. It belonged to Joseph Casson, junior; and now it belonged to the young man’s heirs.\n\nThe latter had been a money-maker, but his father had been a better one. Young Joe had been thrifty, but not as thrifty as his father had been. Young Joe had hired out to Tilson’s as a hardware clerk. Lafe Martin, unable to pay Joe what he’d owed his dad, was now preparing to move off the farm. Joe had held the mortgage which was worth more than the little empire, including all the livestock and implements, and the last rich grain crop.\n\nThere was something — yeah, for the books. Lafe Martin’s sixty thousand dollar farm might’ve spelled young Joe’s doom. Had the boy been out here looking around, meandered down to Big Saffron and Water Moccasin Slough, and been ambushed? Certainly nature had never provided a better ambuscade.\n\nSlowly, through the suffocating heat, I headed for a narrow dirt road, came to a stake-and-rider fence, paused to look this way and that. My eyes fell upon my leather boots, saw the muck, and with a handful of grass I wiped the boots clean. This mud was of a different hue and texture, and you could tell at a glance it had come from the spongy bogs around Big Saffron — if you knew anything about Big Saffron.\n\nI felt of the gun on my right hip, set my hat firmly on my head and headed for Lafe Martin’s farm. A man was coming along the lane between the wooden fences, and he stopped when he saw me. I knew him. His name was Clare Muff, and he was a recluse who lived in a small shack on the Martin farm and sometimes worked for the former owner of the land.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nBeen a Killing\n\nI knew, too, that he never talked to anyone, never even exchanged a greeting with anyone. He’d write his grocery order down and present it to the merchant from whom he’d make the purchases without a single word; and no merchant who knew him would speak to him. Tragically different from any character I’d ever known, Clare Muff seemed harmless enough. His unorthodox nature was revealed, too, in his skinny, long neck his uncommonly long arms, his pale, bony face, his colorless deep set eyes, his unkempt sandy hair, his sharply pointed chin. He just shuffled along, a battered straw hat going to seed on his head, a topknot of hair sticking out through a hole in the crown. And he was barefooted, his overalls cut off about to the knee.\n\nHe stared at me, and I let him pass without a word. I felt sorry for the damned fool. He was no dunce, he was just a clever actor. But he wasn’t getting any fun out of living, if I knew what I was talking about. He padded on away, not looking back, going toward Big Saffron. And I watched him leave the road, take to a field, disappear away down there in the blue gloom.\n\nThe I heard the rattle of a spring wagon. Horses were pulled to a stop. It was Lafe Martin who held the reins.\n\n“Are you goin’ over to my place, George?”\n\n“Yes,” I nodded, clambered aboard the rig and he touched the rumps of the horses with a switch.\n\n“Been a killing. Over on Water Moccasin,” I said.\n\nHe didn’t answer for a moment. The warped wheels of the rig creaked dolefully, like they were lamenting about something. Then Lafe said heavily, “Jest the kind of a place you’d expect it to happen in, George. Who got killed?”\n\n“This will floor you,” I said amiably. The big red headed fellow was sort of likeable. His green eyes were like green safety lamps. But he had a stubborn, reddish stubbled jaw. He wore a hickory shirt and a broadbrimmed black, shapeless hat. “Yeah, it’ll floor you, Lafe — bein’ the victim’s little Joe Casson — “\n\nHis explosion of amazement cut off my speech like he’d snipped it in two with wire clippers. “Jo-ey —  Oh. My Lawd!”\n\nBut I saw the sweat smelling giant spat sedately upon the wagon-tongue, and the tobacco quid stuck there.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nJust Inquirin’\n\n“Joe say he was coming out here?” I asked, after a polite pause. “Did he say he was coming to see about your — well, your little deal?”\n\n“He’s been out here twice already,” Lafe Martin said. “I don’t think he’s missed a foot of the three hundred acres. He didn’t miss an ear of corn in the cribs either.”\n\n“That was like him,” I agreed. “He was an ambitious youth. When was he out here the last time?”\n\n“Yistiddy,” Martin said, switching the horses again. He seemed to have it in for the corpulent bay mare on the right. He put it on her rump harder than he did the little roan “He was out here yistiddy morning.”\n\n“Yessir,” I said. “Long about then he was killed. It’s been hot, rained some but rained fire and brimstone, and the body’s right bad off. What time did Joe leave your place, and which direction did he follow, Lafe?”\n\n“He walked right down this road about ten in the morning. He had a brand new .22 rifle with him.”\n\n“He what?” I swallowed hard, grabbed my hat. Well, there was one for the books. I began to fan myself vigorously.\n\n“‘Said he was takln’ a right smart interest in target shootin’,” Lafe said indolently. “He was walkin’. I wanted to haul him to town. He said he’d pick up a ride. I reckon maybe he did, too  — ride with someone that had it In for him, good and heavylike.”\n\nI rode in silence, the sound of the thin wheels reminding me of a muted flute.\n\n“Where you keen, Lafe?” I asked suddenly, skewing round on the hard teat.\n\n“Been?” His green eyes flashed coldly, like surgical steel. I thought I saw red glints in them. Green lights turn to red, you know. “Why — dang it, I been over to the No’th sixth. Is that any skin offen your shins, George?”\n\nI didn’t get mad, because there wasn’t the right amount of animosity in his voice.\n\n“Nope,” I said. “Just inquirin’. Of course you’ll be asked a lot of questions by Sheriff Custard, Lafe. I’m not so danged sure you won’t be directly accused of shootin’ Joe Casson in the back of the head with a .22 rifle — the brand new one you say he was packing. Bein’ as how you’re about the only one who could profit by the dastardly deed.”\n\nHe didn’t get mad either. He sat there scrooged up like a frog on a log or a bug on a shimmering leaf; but obviously he was ready to hop off if given reasonable provocation.\n\n“I reckon,” he said. “I reckon so, George. But when you come right down to it, how could I profit? He was going to let me stay on and work for him. He said I could stay as long as I pleased. It was my home, he said. I could have it for grain rent. Where else could I go? What else could I do? I been a farmer all my life. This has been home sweet home to me. My father farmed it before me. I was brought up on the place. Now — with Joe Casson a goner, why I’ll have to look around for another place to go, and it’s not going to be easy finding one.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nThe Face of the Thing\n\nThe barns and other outbuildings were in better state of preservation than the one-story unpainted house Lafe Martin lived in. It had thick, native lumber clapboards, a rickety front porch. Behind the biggest barn where they’d taken the body (having hauled the cadaver up from the creek in a small flat truck) was an apple orchard. And standing in the barnlot, with a raft of morningglories twining around a board fence behind it was the freakiest-looking scarecrow I had ever seen. It was a direct effigy of Banker Squire Grately, even to the protruding belly, the sporty Homburg and the garish plaid clothes Grately always wore when he dressed up.\n\nThe face of the thing — danged if it didn’t resemble the squire if you didn’t look at it close enough to see it had been painted on a board with a small brush and barn paints of variegated hues. The clothes were a castoff suit of the squire’s, too, Lafe told me when I asked him.\n\n“He gave me the suit when we was friends, George,” the farmer explained. “He said I could have it made over for my nephew who is now off at college learning to be a doctor.”\n\n“When you were friends?” I snapped, picking up this lead.\n\n“What you mean?”\n\nWe’d stopped at the windmill for a drink. Lafe sent the gourd to the bottom of the galvanized pail, brought it up dripping with cold water and handed it to me.\n\n“We fell out when Grately began crowding me. He was looking after old man Casson’s business, and Grately’s a hard one to deal with. I’d been rained out five years in succession. The high water got up, everything went wrong. He jest won’t give me a reasonable chance. I told young Joe about it when he came back from the war, and it made the boy mad. But I don’t know what he ever done about it.”\n\n“When the squire sees that dummy,” I said, barely able to control my mirth but without my face showing how tickled I was, “he’ll blow a fuse.”\n\n“Maybe he will. I sure hope he does. I got it ready a long time ago, so when he came out to drive me off the farm he’d see what I thought of him.” It didn’t make rhyme or reason, but it was kind of smart, so to speak. And as I always say — there was one for the books.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nThe Same Weird Whistle\n\nI gazed into the crowd, found the sheriff and told him what I’d gleaned from Lafe Martin. I knew skinny little Homer Custard didn’t have his heart in it when he said he’d have to arrest Lafe for Joe Casson’s murder, if he couldn’t find an out for himself. He meant an alibi.\n\nThe barn was jammed with curious neighbors. You take a killing in the country and a crowd always gathers as if pouring out of the skies. I reckon the party lines got busy and all the receivers came down at once.\n\nThe squire kept urging Sheriff Custard to take immediate action against Lafe Martin.\n\n“Of course you’ll say I’m prejudiced,” he declaimed, “but my aim isn’t to cause an innocent person trouble. I feel that Lafe Martin’s the power behind all this sinister stuff. Furthermore, the dummy isn’t as harmless as it appears to be. It would seem on the face of it that Martin’s idea was merely to make me a laughing stock. His real motive for erecting the effigy can’t be seen with the naked eye. You’ll find out, Homer. You’ll find out.”\n\n“You’ve no proof of Martin’s implication in Casson’s murder,” the sheriff averred. “We’ve got no grounds to arrest him, at least none that would stand up in court.”\n\n“At the proper time I’ll show my hand,” Squire Grately said. “Right now I want to delve a little deeper into this thing. But — mark my word, Homer — if you don’t arrest him, you’ll be sorry!”\n\nThen we heard someone whistling. Again the banker canted his head. Again sweat gleamed on his face too thick to run, and it adhered to his eyebrows like little specks of flour dough. The front of the old man’s shirt didn’t appear to have a single dry spot on it. He looked around, up and down the yard, but none of us could ferrit out the whistler because the sound had ceased to be, and only its echo remained.\n\nThe sheriff looked at me and I looked at him. Then we both looked at the garishly clad scarecrow. Clouds scudded over the sun. There was a distant rumble of thunder. Abruptly a cool breeze came across the level fields to dispel the killing humidity.\n\n“It’s the same sound we heard out by Water Moccasin Slough,” I said. “The same whistler. You can’t fool me on the sound. What does it remind you of?” I asked bluntly.\n\n“Squeaking wheels,” Sheriff Custard said. “Dry squeaking sheets — “\n\nThe squire was mopping sweat. “Well, damn it, let’s get the work done. Have the coroner call his jurors. Pick out six men and put the facts before them. I’ll be one — “\n\n“I reckon the corner selects his own jury,” the little sheriff said. “We’ll see.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nCoroner’s Jury\n\nWe marched across the porch into the front room of the bedraggled frame house. The parlor was full of stale air. I saw a few horse-hair upholstered fixtures, a huge writing desk, a standtable bearing a stereoscope and several boxes of slides, a heavy family Bible, and a thick album with a mirror in the cover. The coroner sat down at the desk, picked out his six men. Banker Grately was included. Chairs were brought for them and lined up against the wall.\n\n“I allow the verdict should be the victim met death at the hands of a person or persons unknown,” I said to the sheriff.\n\n“I’m not so sure,” Homer Custard said. “I’m not sure what’s goin’ to happen here before we can get away, George.”\n\nThe first witnesses were called. These were the duck hunters. They described how they’d found the body on the pile of burlap sacks, and the rat poison that was sprinkled around the corpse so that the animals and buzzards had let it alone.\n\nThen Lafe Martin was called for. But he wasn’t in the house. The sheriff told me to stay there, he’d find Lafe.\n\nBanker Grately moved up from the jury box.\n\n“If it pleases you, sire,” he said to the coroner, “I’ve changed my mind. I’d like to be excused from jury duty. I know it’s late for that. But I’ve just thought of something. I have some testimony I’d like to present to the court — some light to shed on the tragedy. I suggest you let me talk before they find Lafe Martin —\n\nThe coroner muled this over in his mind. He was a slow, deliberate person. He said, finally, he’d make allowance for that. And a man was chosen to take Grately’s place in the box. They started all over again. A neighboring farmer was called to the stand, and he told what amounted to an accusation against the absent Martin. The farmer was a shy, modest person. He rubbed his pants with his sweaty, nervous hands. He related how Joe Casson had been contemplating moving Lafe Martin off the place. When asked how he knew this, how he’d found it out, the man said, “My banker told me.”\n\n“Who is your banker?” the coroner asked.\n\n“Squire Grately,” the farmer said. “Joe Casson transacted all his business with Squire Grately, and so did Joe’s father. That’s why Lafe Martin made the scarecrow, jest to humiliate the Squire if the Squire ever should come out to force a sale or anything “\n\nThe scarecrow was proving absolutely demolishing to Lafe Martin’s best interests. It had begun to rain. I said to myself, “That dummy out there will sure send Lafe Martin to jail. Why did he do such a damnation crazy thing?\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nThe Whistler\n\nWe suddenly heard someone in vicinity of the barn behind the house pounding on steel, like maybe he was changing a tire on an automobile. Squire Grately was called to the chair.\n\nThe squire spoke calmly.\n\n“I’ve handled their business twenty years,” he began. “Old Joe Casson was my best friend. He didn’t like Lafe Martin. Lafe was always making excuses for not paying him, first one crazy reason and then another. Old Joe said for me to make sure his son got what Lafe Martin owed him or the farm one, it didn’t matter which. That’s what I meant to do. Joe came home from the war and we had a serious talk. At first he was reluctant to foreclose on Lafe, but he changed his mind when I told him his father had insisted on making Lafe Martin pay in full. Young Joe said he’d have it out with Lafe; he did, and Lafe who was already sore at me, got killing mad. He made that dummy out there, and tried to pass it off as a joke. But every time I got close to the dummy it chilled my blood. There’s something more sinister about it than can be seen with the eye. Lafe Martin killed Joe, but he — “\n\nHis lips smacked as he puffed at a burnt out cigar.\n\nThe vicious pounding of steel on steel suddenly stopped. From close to the house came that eerie whistling, the same we’d heard near Big Saffron and from around the barn.\n\nAnd Squire Grately jumped; he gave an awful shriek, dropped the cigar from his twitching lips and fell forward in a half stumble from his chair. He groped, with his arms above his head, lunged, then made a jerking dive for the open door. It was then that he collided with Sheriff Custard who’d just emerged from the languid shadows of the porch. There was a solid thump as their heads came together.\n\nBut it was the squire who was up and away before Sheriff Custard recovered his equilibrium. His boots stomped in a run across the planking of the porch; his lurching shadow spurted across the yard.\n\nBut upon reaching the door, with excited men piling around me and scuffing the floor with harsh boots, the sight that met my eyes was so startling, I just stood and gulped. Under one of the ancient cottonwoods, locked in a desperate struggle was the squire and the scarecrowish figure of weird Clare Muff. He was trying to stick a knife in the banker’s breast, but the latter had both pudgy hands clasped around the hobgobblin’s wrist so he couldn’t push the blade in. I tore out, yelling at Clare, and reached them just as they both fell to the ground. The lithe, smaller man had wrested himself free, and now his heels flashed upward, to catch me in the chest, as I bent over to grab him. Naked, calloused heels.\n\nI was sent hard against the tree and showered cotton down upon the grass. A gun ground out a jangling crash, and the scarecrow of a man jumped, struck against me and slid to the ground. He was clutching madly at his shirt. Buttons were scattered in every direction. He kicked, flailed with his feet and even after I’d grabbed him and got myself covered with blood, he continued the struggle. Homer Custard put his smoking gun in his pockets and seized Clare Muff, pinning him on the ground.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nThe Hobgoblin\n\n“He was hiding behind the tree to warn Lafe if you started out to look for him. Lafe was trying to get a tire on his car so he could escape. I recognized Clare’s whistling signals as the same we’d heard before, and got too mad to sit still and wait any longer when I doped out what was going on. I don’t know how many times I’ve heard Clare Muff whistle like that when we three were riding in Lafe’s spring wagon; he was always trying to imitate the dry grinding of the rattling wheels.”\n\n“You mean Lafe killed Joe Casson?” I demanded aggressively.\n\n“No, not with his own hands,” the squire said. “They meant to get me, not Joe. Lafe figured I stood in the way and if he could rid the community of my presence for good, he’d be able to pull the wool over Joe Casson’s eyes. I met Joe coming from this place yesterday morning. We’d been discussing cutting a road through the swamp, and putting a bridge across Big Saffron to save distance to Mason City. I told Joe it was a good time to look the situation over and we drove down to the road bridge in my car and walked up to Water Moccasin Slough. Just as the ambusher fired the gun Joe moved into the path of the bullet. I ran, knowing it was me they were after, that they’d made a horrible mistake.\n\n“Why didn’t you tell us about it?” Sheriff Custard asked.\n\n“I wanted to do my own detective work, figured you’d doubt me. When Lafe slipped away from the house, I knew he was trying to make his escape, that he’d failed to convince you of his innocence.”\n\n“Come on out to the scarecrow in the barnlot,” Sheriff Custard said. “I want to look that thing over. I’ve got Lafe bound hand and foot in the barn. I think he’ll be willing to talk now, with Clare Muff dead.”\n\nWe trudged out to the hobgobblin and Homer Custard and I took it down. It lay on the straw and wheat chaff of the barnlot, looking almost like the squire, even to his bay window. It surprised me how heavy the thing was when I tried to lift it. Homer removed the coat while I held it off the ground. He slit the fancy shirt open, and drew the flaps back. Then I got a jolt, believe me.\n\nThe dummy was full of bullet holes. Somebody had been using it for a target. And those slugs had been stopped by a thick mattress like padding, and every damned one of the leaden ball was in the scarecrow. No wonder it was so heavy.\n\nWhen Homer cut it open with his jackknife we began to pluck those bullets out of the dummy. And I’m not lying to you when I say we counted five hundred and sixty three twenty-two slugs as we piled them on the earth beside the hobgoblin.\n\n“Everytime he put a slug into the belly of the effigy he was getting the same satisfaction he would’ve experienced from murdering me — almost,” the squire said.\n\nBut we got another surprise. When Lafe Martin confessed he said Clare Muff had done the shooting. He’d hired Clare to kill the squire and had seen to it that he was a crack shot before he let him make the venture. Besides, the reason he’d dressed the dummy in Squire Grately’s old clothes was to make sure when the little weird guy fired from ambush he got the right man.\n\nAs I say — there’s one for the books.\n\nTHE END\n"

The patient who had just left his office had assured him that he was perfectly all right save for a glass heart, which he lived in constant terror of cracking by colliding with somebody, or by slipping on a wet pavement.\n\nBefore him, there had been a pretty girl bubbling with enthusiasm over a scheme for curing stammerers by intravenal injections of parrot’s blood. And so it went, every afternoon from two until four. Arbuthnot elevated his brows politely, and gazed upon the pale, emaciated man of sixty-odd who faced him across the wide table.\n\n“You know too much — about what?”\n\n“Everything! Big things, and trifles. All my senses are abnormally keen. Without in the least wishing to do so, I overheard all your conversation with the patients who preceded me, through your soundproof door. Coming downtown, I passed seven hundred and thirteen pedestrians; and I could describe each one so minutely that any reasonably intelligent police officer could identify him at sight. On the street cars, I can hear the ticking of every watch, and distinguish the minute differences in beat and pitch. Yesterday I rode for two miles along the principal business street of a Jersey city. I can write out for you every sign, every scrap of lettering on the shop fronts of the side I was facing, along the entire route. When I smell a perfume, I at once identify each of the dozen or more coaltar derivatives from which it has been built up.”\n\nDr. Arbuthnot nodded.\n\n“I have treated cases not unlike yours,” he said. “There is no cause for alarm. You are probably overworking. Drop everything and play for a while. Golf. Or long tramps in the country.”\n\n“No use. I should count the apples on the trees, and if I laid down to rest I should hear the grass grow and the earthworms burrowing far beneath. I can stand it daytimes, but of late my mind retains its activity until I sink into a sort of stupor toward dawn. I am sixty-three, and I’ve never used drugs of any sort. Now I want something to make me sleep, at least every other night.”\n\nThe alienist made the customary examination, with stethoscope and opthalmoscope; tested his reflexes, and questioned him upon his family history.\n\nJohn Slade’s father had been of a type not uncommon in rural New England, although dying out. Self-taught, save for what the village academy could impart, he knew a little about many things. He was a naturalist, of sorts. Was always pointing out glacial scratches on the rocks in the neighborhood, and finding Indian arrowheads. Had a fine collection of butterflies, and knew them all by their Latin names. Botanized a great deal by day, and read the stars by night through a rusty old telescope. Understood the ways of fishes and wood creatures. Could enjoy his New Testament in both Greek and Latin. With his hands he was able to repair sewing machines, pumps, typewriters, or clocks, and could design and build a modest house unaided. Knew surveying, and served as the local undertaker. With two or three simple tools he could do things that would have baffled a master mechanic, — yet could not have passed an examination as plumber’s assistant. A gentle, visionary man, the only resident of his county to whom Spinoza and Descartes and Einstein meant anything at all, he lived and died as poor as a church mouse.\n\nSlade’s mother was a French-Canadian, unable to read or write. She had the illiterate peasant’s extraordinary powers of minute observation, was a neat housewife, a mixture of cunning and credulity, and a devout Christian.\n\nJohn Slade himself cared nothing for money. When he needed any, he invented something. His education, begun by tramping the countrywide with his father and absorbing all sorts of illassorted facts, had been pursued in many lands. At one time he buried himself in Johns Hopkins, engrossed in biology and embryology. Next he was heard of at Oxford, steeped in medievalism. Physics at Leipsic and Prague. Chemistry at Bonn. Back again to the States, he flitted from Massachusetts Tech to the Edison laboratories. Always learning. Never producing — save when lack of funds drove him to some hack work: a course of lectures before the Lowell Institute, the invention of a crankless ice-cream freezer, an article for some technical publication.\n\n“I know too much,” he repeated after answering all of Arbuthnot’s questions. “That is the trouble. And now I cannot sleep!”\n\nThe physician gave him some advice as to exercise and diet, to which he listened abstractedly. Then he handed him a little vial of the lethal tablets which would, for a time at least, permit his distracted brain to forget.\n\nUsually he was able to dismiss his patients from his mind after he had done what he could for them, and filed their cards away. He did not find it so easy to forget Slade.\n\nFor one thing, he came upon articles written by him from time to time, in the journals to which he subscribed. His fellow practitioners mentioned him occasionally. Slade was a sort of mystery, with it was admitted that he knew more about embryology and chemistry than they did themselves. Nobody could tell just how much the fellow did know! Whatever he said or wrote was uttered with authority and was hard to refute. He had a laboratory which none of them had ever seen, and where it was rumored that he carried on extraordinary experiments, the nature of which was unknown.\n\nNevertheless, Arbuthnot had very nearly forgotten him when, six months after his call, he received a brief note requesting the alienist to visit him the following afternoon, upon a matter of life and death.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Menace to God Almighty\n\nPromptly upon the departure of his last patient at a little after four next day, Arbuthnot stepped into the taxicab he had already summoned, and fifteen minutes later was admitted by John Slade himself to his quarters on the top floor of a wholesale storage house well downtown. There was nobody about except the janitor, who took him up in a rickety freight elevator and indicated the door bearing Slade’s card.\n\nHe had become much thinner, more haggard, the physician’s swiftly appraising glance told him, as he took his dry, skinny hand in greeting. The eyes seemed to have retreated deep into their bony sockets, and were now magnified by thick toric lenses. The man’s bare feet were thrust into sandals, and he wore a light, loosely belted linen robe falling to his knees. He took Arbuthnot’s hat and indicated an easy chair.\n\nThe room was evidently Slade’s general living quarters. It was large, square, lighted on two sides by windows. Its utter lack of the atmosphere of the conventional bachelor’s “den” struck Arbuthnot at once: There were no hospitable glasses, or tea-things, nor so much as a pipe rack or ash tray. The place was as ascetic as a monk’s cell; an effect heightened by Slade’s girdled robe and the sandals. Books — ranks and columns of them — in built-in cases along three sides of the wall. A great flat table, with reading lamp and precise stacks of papers, a rack of sharpened pencils, an open volume with fresh marginal annotations. A wide couch bed at one end, its blankets neatly folded. Filing cases at its head and foot. Through a half-open door Arbuthnot glimpsed the famous laboratory  — mostly a gleam of white enamel, against which glimmered the blue-green of retorts and the glitter of polished brass.\n\nSlade seated himself.\n\n“Do you believe that suicide is ever justifiable, Arbuthnot?”\n\nThe physician started.\n\n“Certainly not!”\n\nSlade laughed.\n\n“Old inhibitions, doctor! First, your Hippocratian oath –which was never composed by Hippocrates, and is a jumble of pompous platitudes. Then, your religion. We mustn’t take life–because that power is the only one we hold in common with God. Therefore  — God is jealous!”\n\nArbuthnot scanned the face before him, scored deeply with the lines of insomnia, strangely illuminated with the vast mental energy going on within.\n\nEverything at top speed, — he thought without replying. Blood pressure too high, of course. Pulse rapid and wiry  — you could catch its flutter over the hollow temples. Breathing short — and stirring only the upper chest. Burn out pretty fast, at this rate … .\n\n“I told you what my trouble was,” Slade continued in his tired voice. “I know too much. And I know more now than on that day when I consulted you. Oh, very much more!”\n\nStill the alienist uttered no comment. Let the poor devil talk. It was a relief  — sort of safety-valve.\n\n“The fact is, I know so much that I am a menace to God Almighty! One of us — so it seems to me — must go. And you sit there, smugly, and tell me that suicide is wrong. As one would tell a naughty child not to bite its nails.” Slade closed his eyes for a moment and inhaled a deep breath. Then he pulled open a drawer in his table and held out a little oblong glass slide.\n\n“Bits of protoplasm, Arbuthnot. Life cells. And all the scientists in the world, with their most cunning microscopes and reagents, cannot isolate one of them and say whether it would have developed into a rear-admiral or a cucumber; an elephant or a moth; a theologian or a toadstool! Am I right?”\n\nThe physician half smiled.\n\n“With certain reservations you are perfectly correct,” he admitted.\n\n“One step separates me from divinity,” Slade remarked. “I haven’t yet actually created a life cell, but I stand on the threshold. And then — what?”\n\n“Many have stood on the threshold a longtime, Slade. With the eggs of sea urchins and — “\n\n“Grammar school stuff! Piffle!! I tell you, in less than a year, probably within three months, I can from inorganic substances form a living cell. Then, having the power of creating and destroying life, I shall emerge, the lone pioneer, the first human being to rise to godship. And I don’t dare. I tell you, I am afraid! What of? I don’t know. Not of anything that can happen to this wreck of a body. Not of any hell-and-damnation stuff. Not of pure annihilation. But I am horribly afraid — of something. So much so that I am withholding my foot just as I lift it to take that final step that divides men and gods.”\n\n“I think you are perfectly right,” Arbuthnot assented in soothing tones. “I’d feel the same way about it myself!” Slade stared at him for a moment before his yellow face broke into a myriad of little wrinkles, and his voice into cracked laughter.\n\n“You’re only a little fellow in your profession, after all! You think I’m demented — even now you’re figuring on how to keep me quiet till you can get a message to the Psychopathic Hospital.”\n\nThe alienist went mottled-red. It was precisely what he was thinking–but he was a man of great dignity, and hated to be mocked even by a lunatic.\n\n“You’ve no right to say that,” he parried. “I simply agreed with you.”\n\n“Well — even alienists know enough not to contradict their patients, don’t they? You didn’t dispute that chap when he told you he had a glass heart! Humor us, my learned friend. Humor us!”\n\nInstantly dropping his banter, he leaned forward, his voice falling to a whisper.\n\n“What would you say if I told you that I could take any life cell and make of it what I choose? What are the determining factors?. Light — heat — moisture — food — what we term in general, environment.”\n\nHe touched a thick, leather-bound book on the table.\n\n“Here are the formulas, all worked out. What will you, my good Arbuthnot? An oak tree, or a lizard? A pretty girl, or a serpent — or, if you like, both in one?”\n\nHe rose jerkily, and beckoned his visitor to follow him into the other room.\n\nArbuthnot, now thoroughly on his guard against any sudden violence directed by Slade against either of them, followed him into a room twice as long as the other, and fitted up as a laboratory.\n\nEven in his anxiety, the extraordinary neatness and order of the room caught his notice. There was none of the litter familiar to such places presided over by man, with only vestigial housekeeping instincts. Brass and nickel were gleaming. Test tubes, glass jars, stood in racks or on shelves. Rows of labeled bottles were not sticky or stained by escaping drops of their own contents. Tables, floor, walls, showed no trace of dust or grime. A tall threeleaved screen cut off one end of the long room, which was lighted from a skylight, it being too early to turn on any of the numerous incandescents.\n\nSlade crossed over to where, apparently, a huge steel safe was set in the wall, and opened the thick door. It swung easily and noiselessly upon its oiled pinions, revealing a closet the height of a tall man, with a perforated disc upon the floor, and a grill of shining rods extending to the top. Overhead was an oblong box thickly wound with heavy copper wire. A number of dials, indicators and gauges were attached to a heavy plate screwed to the inside of the door. Slade turned to the silent physician.\n\n“This is my lethal chamber,” he explained. “One who enters this steel chest and throws this switch, ceases to exist. He disappears. More scientifically, since in our universe nothing can be destroyed, he is transmuted into material not identifiable by our imperfect senses. Simply open the door five minutes after I enter, and you will see. Or rather, you will not see!”\n\nArbuthnot made an involuntary step toward the other, who smiled and closed the heavy door.\n\n“Do not be alarmed! I have other things to show you.”\n\nHe pointed out a few of the ingenious contrivances in the laboratory, calling especial attention to his electric incinerator and showing his guest how, by turning a small lever, a globular furnace became white hot in a minute or two. Anything placed therein would shrivel almost instantly to ashes.\n\n“And now for the real exhibit,” he said, leading Arbuthnot to the far end of the room and around the screen which he had noted on entering.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nPart Man — Part Seaweed\n\nLate afternoon had set in; and the dusk revealed nothing but a long row of square glass cases standing upon a trestle and emanating a sickly greenish light in the afterglow which slanted down through the skylight.\n\nSlade switched on some incandescents.\n\nDetails leaped out at Arbuthnot. He noted that some of the glass tanks contained a fluid, while others were dry. Electric wires were connected with each, and thermometers indicated their interior heat. Faint stirrings — a little scraping on the sand of one of the dry containers — indicated some sort of life within. Slade touched his sleeve and directed him to the end of the row.\n\nPeering within, the alienist made out some creature which he could not identify, nor even classify as plant or animal. It swayed gently in the water, its eight or nine inches erect, with a bulbous head and a suggestion of human features; but its limbs were like some unwholesome plant, with twigs for hands and feet. It seemed rooted in a yellowish-gray clay at the bottom of the tank. Little bubbles rose continuously from its mouth.\n\n“Part man — part seaweed,” observed Slade. “What do you think of it?”\n\nArbuthnot bent closely over the stagnant water. A feeling of horror crept through his veins like iced water. The homunculus turned its head — if it was a head — upward, and its eyes, whitish and without expression, seemed to look through the viscous fluid into his own. A rudimentary nose — a wide mouth–sessile ears — these he made out before the thing seemed to take fright and slithered down to burrow into the clay in which its lower limbs were rooted.\n\nWithout a comment Arbuthnot permitted himself to be led to the next tank.\n\nHere was, unquestionably, a miniature woman. Beautiful and shapely as a fairy, with perfect breasts and an exquisite little head swaying upon a slender neck, her skin shimmered silverygreen in the water. Arbuthnot turned deathly sick as he saw that below the waist she — it — was seemingly a slimy eel!\n\nConcerning the occupants of the other glass boxes he retained only a jangled sense of hideous and unclassifiable monstrosities. There were serpents that were part vegetable; plants that mocked humanity. There were other things that fascinated by a sort of loathsome beauty. Sickened to the soul, he was dragged back to a consciousness of the present by the low-pitched voice of John Slade, whose presence he had forgotten.\n\n“I don’t suppose that I can possibly explain my feelings toward these little creatures. We have no adjectives, no similes for it — because it isn’t a human emotion. I am the first man ever to know it. There is nothing of sex in it, you see; nothing comparable to love of wife, or parents, or offspring. It is the yearning of the creator over the people he has created. God feels it, I suppose, for us; but in depicting God’s love we grope for words and say that he cares for us as a father for his son.”\n\nHe moved from the blue-green tanks with their faint stirrings of a nameless life shadowing the translucent glass. At the end of the screen he turned to look squarely back at Arbuthnot.\n\n“Although a narrow and unimaginative man, you are an honest one,” he said. “You will know what to do. I am going back to nothingness!”\n\nThe physician heard him cross the room, caught the soft click of the lever as he threw open the great steel door. He leaped forward, overturning the screen, and beheld Slade with a quick motion cast aside his single garment and shuffle off his sandals. His naked body stood out for a second against the dark interior of the metal closet; and then the door closed noiselessly behind him.\n\nArbuthnot’s impulse to rush forward and open the door was arrested by a deep, musical tone which came from the closet. Slowly, and by infinitesimal tonal shadings, it rose through the scale, culminating at length in an incredibly thin and high note, like the keenest harmonic of a violin. It died away into silence; but he had a feeling that the sound was still mounting up and up, though now far beyond the range of his ear. Then he turned, steadily enough, and switched on the current in the electric incinerator.\n\nThe half-hour that followed was never anything save a horrible nightmare. The details were not clear, and he made no effort to recall them. On many a sleepless night he prayed to be able to forget them all.\n\nWhen the furnace was white hot he began dropping into it, one by one, the living organisms from their glass tanks. As he moved back and forth, there were times when he felt that he was a malignant deity destroying a world. A sense of megalomania, like that induced by certain drugs, obsessed him. The poor creatures didn’t want to die; that was plain enough. They clung to their bleak, arid lives, and they feared and hated him. When Slade had approached their tanks they had evinced a feeble pleasure or, at least, a sluggish indifference. But from Arbuthnot they shrank, seeking to hide away among the pebbles and sand and fragments of coral. And into his mind came the words of Scripture, how on the Last Day the human mites shall call upon the mountains to cover them!\n\nThe little tree-man fought with a futile rage, seeking to bite his fingers, and making no more impression upon the skin than if it had been buffalo hide. Its tiny twig-like fingers struggled ceaselessly; and it seemed to feel acute pain as he uprooted it from its bed of clay. But the eel-woman offered no resistance; and her tragic despair was the harder to bear. She covered her wee breasts with her hands, and tears unbelievably minute rolled down her face.\n\nDown Arbuthnot’s streams of perspiration poured, as one by one he dropped Slade’s creations hissing into the white-hot incinerator. When at length he had done, ending by burning the great book, filled with the formula; which might conceivably enable another to recreate a forbidden microcosm, his limbs were trembling and his pulse racing.\n\nOrdinarily, he would have dreaded to open the steel door which Slade had closed behind him; but after what he had done, anything else seemed commonplace. His nerves refused to react further. Listlessly, and almost incuriously, he crossed the room, turned the lever and pulled open the door.\n\nA wave of heated air swept out, stirring the damp hair upon his forehead. But there was no one inside.\n\nThe steel closet was shining and empty.\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "Suzanne and I staggered into her pretty apartment late one afternoon. We collapsed in comfortable chairs, and packages dripped from our limp fingers onto the floor.\n\n“Ooooff!” said Suzanne.\n\n“Ooooooh!” I moaned.\n\n“Honestly, Sally, I didn’t know that shopping could be such a task, did you? It’s really hard work.”\n\n“Infant,” I said, adjusting my feet to a comfortable height, “if shopping killed me, I’d still love it. And there’s the comfort of knowing that you have such a lovely trousseau and you’ve been so sensible about money!”\n\nMy little neighbor sighed contentedly as she murmured–“That sports suit is a ducky thing, isn’t it, Sally? And my wedding dress! But I did hope we’d find time to get the beauty aids you think I ought to have for a honeymoon. You know, Sally — you old beauty-sleuth — I’d like to take you right along with Bob and me.”\n\n“You’ve got to think of Bob’s feelings now, as well as your own,” I reminded her. “Besides, you won’t need me or any one else along, when we get through planning this beauty kit. A necessary kit, for Love isn’t so blind that he can’t see beauty!”\n\nSuzanne nodded her head in agreement.\n\n“Anyway.” I went on. “I’ve got to go shopping by myself, tomorrow — l want to buy a wedding present for a very dear friend of mine. Now get a paper and pencil, and we’ll just run over what you need for that honeymoon kit.”\n\nSuzanne finally located a pencil, and took off her shoes before she got settled. Then she wrote HONEYMOON BEAUTY KIT across the first page, and looked up at me, her eyes sparkling.\n\n“We’re off!” she said gaily — Shoot!”\n\n“Well, first of all, tell me where you’re going to spend your honeymoon,” I asked.\n\n“But that’s a secret,” Suzanne teased.\n\n“Then you get no beauty kit from me,” I said firmly. “How in the world do you expect me to advise you about the hundred and one things you’ll need to know, unless I know where you’re going?”\n\n“But I’ll need the same things wherever I am, short of the North Pole or the Equator,” argued Suzanne. “It will still be my face.”\n\n“You’re positively old fashioned,” I sniffed. “You don’t have anywhere near the same beauty problems when you’re in different parts of the country. Now — where are you going?”\n\n“On a motor trip,” said Suzanne meekly, “through the mountains and down south to New Orleans, and then up through the southwest to California. And I love the idea, Sally, but even a fifty-mile auto trip makes my skin burn, and my eyelids get red, and I look a perfect mess! And, of course, I can’t carry a whole beauty store with me, or stop every five miles to fix m.V complexion. :lob hates fussy women.”\n\n“Most men do.” I agreed, laughing at Suzanne’s mournful picture of her honeymoon. “But the first thing you must learn is — that  happiness is the greatest beautifier you can have. We’ll put that down on the list first.”\n\nMy neighbor bent her head over the list and wrote in large capitals.\n\n“Now the next thing we have to plan,” I went on, “is the type of cosmetic kit you are going to carry. If you can possibly manage one, I’d suggest a small, separate case for all beauty aids. This you can carry yourself, and you won’t have to unpack a suitcase when you want to freshen up pronto. If space is very valuable, however, get one of those rubberized kits with a zipper attachment. They can be tucked into any corner of the suitcase and they’re really helpful, too.\n\n“To put in your kit, you’ll need a good cleansing cream first. The one you use now is good — it’s quick melting and put up in a tight jar. I’m sure you won’t have any difficulty getting a fresh jar of the same brand in any town you visit.”\n\n“That’s right,” said Suzanne brightly. “I really don’t need to carry a lot of things, Sally, because I can always replace them when I need to.”\n\n“Don’t depend on that too much,” I cautioned. “If Bob doesn’t like fussy women, he won’t care for a wife, either, who insists that he run down to the drug store for cold cream. Next — in the kit —  — you’ll want cleansing tissues, and a nourishing cream to pat under your eyes every night. You’ll need to use that cream a great deal when you are traveling through the south. Then, your skin is so dry that you won’t need an astringent, but a skin tonic is a necessity. If you get a brand that is fragrant, you’ll find it most refreshing and restful to use.”\n\n“That isn’t much, so far,” observed Suzanne, looking critically at the list.\n\n“We won’t make it a long one,”\n\nI assured her, “but there are several more beauty aids we must include. First, a liquid powder. This will protect your skin from windburn or sunburn and keep the dust of the road from getting deeply into the pores. Also — you’ll look fresh and lovely for many miles without having to use a powder puff over and over. That’s particularly bad on a motor trip, for you simply add powder to cover up the grime, and the puff becomes soiled after a few applications.\n\n“And either a liquid or rouge paste ought to be in the beauty kit, too. Naturally, you’ll have face powder–a heavy, clinging kind is best for this type of trip. And by all means pack a deodorant talcum and some drying talcum for your feet. There are several good foot powders that are scented and cooling. You’d better take care of your feet, in case you have to walk back home!”\n\n“I’ll never do that,” laughed Suzanne, “but I’ll keep my feet in good condition, anyway — I might have to run after Bob and bring him back when he gets a glimpse of some of those southern beauties.”\n\n“Oh — we’ll make you just as lovely,” I promised. “N ow — on with the list. You can get a sun-proof cream or lotion instead of that liquid powder I spoke of a few minutes ago. The sun-proof cream might be the very thing for you — ask for a small jar tomorrow, and try it out for the next few weeks. You’ll need a hand cream, too. There are so many non-greasy ones, you can just take your choice. Use it every morning and night — not just in emergencies — and then your hands will keep lovely. Oh yes! — and add a small package of powdered boracic acid — it is such an excellent eyewash.\n\n“Well, I guess that covers the essentials for a beauty kit,” I said, “except those beauty tools that we all just have to have.”\n\n“What do you mean — brush and comb, and things like that?” asked Suzanne.\n\nMy little neighbor bounded off the chair in her excitement. “I forgot to show you,” she said breathlessly, dashing into the bedroom, “my Aunt Clara’s wedding present that came this morning.”\n\nIn a second she was back, carrying a great, satin-lined box that contained a gorgeous set of toilette accessories from a mirror to a cuticle knife. It was elaborate, but pretty.\n\n“That’s one of the most beautiful sets I’ve ever seen,” I assured Suzanne — “simply scrumptious.”\n\n“Isn’t it?” she asked happily. “You see, Sally, I won’t have to worry about anything but an orange wood stick — everything else is here.”\n\n“And that’s where it ought to stay,” I told her. “Take along only what can be replaced easily and inexpensively at the next town.”\n\nSuzanne carried the case back to her room. “You’re right, of course,” she said, “but I never had a grand set like this with everything matching, and I wanted to show off a little bit.”\n\n“You wouldn’t care much for it by the time you finished your trip?” I gathered up my handbag, hat and gloves and prepared to return to my own apartment, next door. “What you ought to get, Suzanne, are light, simple accessories — and not so many of them. Your hairbrush should be firm, with a wooden back. The comb ought to be light weight, too. And with a flexible nail file, an orangewood stick and a nail brush, you will have enough to keep your manicure looking well for days at a time.\n\n“There’s another little item, too, Suzanne, that you’ll have to think of long and hard if you don’t have a separate case for your cosmetics. Look at those new leak-proof bottles that are being sold at most cosmetic counters. They save you many miles of worry when you have to pack liquids along with your best chiffons. If you can’t get them, then get an extra supply of all size corks. Many of the creams I mentioned come in tubes, too. They are, of course, lighter to carry, and many women prefer them because they are so sanitary.”\n\nSuzanne came to the door with me and stood waiting until I reached my own apartment. “Just one question — “ she said.\n\n“What’s that?”\n\n“Will you help me make up on the fatal day?” said Suzanne.\n\n“You couldn’t keep me away with wild horses,” I promised her. “Brides are easy to make look beautiful–and Bob is going to be glad he asked you when you walk toward the altar. But give the beauty sleuth a chance.”\n\n“How do you mean?” asked my little neighbor.\n\n“Get some rest,” I answered, “Good night!”\n\nTHE END\n"

At each step his feet seemed to move more sluggishly. His relaxed figure indicated complete lack of purpose. Yet not for an instant did his eyes waver from the front doors of the First National Bank of Clayville.\n\nThe bank was across the street, on the corner, and in exactly three minutes it would close. Jim Forde was timing his steps so that he could cross the street and enter the door just a few seconds before it was scheduled to close.\n\nForde, although almost a stranger in the village, knew a great deal about that bank and the young man, named Bert Orton, who managed it. It was a one-man bank. It never carried more than five thousand in cash. Five thousand was ample to care for the ordinary needs of the few business houses in the village. The bank shipped its excess cash to banks in nearby cities where it could be drawn upon when needed.\n\nForde’s eyes glittered a little as Sam Weisner, who owned and operated two of the local stores, emerged from the doors of the bank. An empty bag swung from Weisner’s wrist. He had just made his last deposit for the day. He hurried on up the opposite side of the street.\n\nForde reached the corner. He glanced at his watch and moved his left arm a bit to assure himself that his gun and holster hadn’t slipped out of place. Then he crossed the street, still walking deliberately. It was fifteen seconds to three o’clock when he pushed open the door of the bank and stepped inside.\n\nAs he closed the door he unobtrusively threw the inside bolt so that no one could enter behind him. A quick glance told him that Bert Orton was alone in the single cage that the bank boasted. Orton appeared not to notice that the bolt had been thrown, but he thrust his head through the opening in the grille and looked sharply at Forde.\n\nThe questioning look in his eyes was natural. Bert Orton had never seen Jim Forde before. But there was no threat in Forde’s pleasant features. He was smiling.\n\n“What is it?” Orton asked quickly. “The bank is closing — right now.”\n\n“I guessed as much.” Forde’s smile widened as he spoke. “I took the liberty of throwing the bolt as I entered. I wanted to make sure we wouldn’t be interrupted.”\n\nOrton looked startled, took a step backward.\n\n“You needn’t be alarmed,” Forde held up the-palms of his hands reassuringly. “It’s not a stickup. I only want to ask you a few questions. I closed the door so that a late customer couldn’t interrupt us. My name is Forde — Jim Forde. Here’s my calling card.”\n\nHe took a small leather case from his pocket as he advanced to the window, opened it, held it up for Orton’s inspection. Orton took a very deep breath as he looked at it, then expelled slowly.\n\n“You — you,” Orton stammered and he lost a little color in his face, “you’re what the papers call a — a — “\n\n“A G-man?” Forde chuckled. “Right. I’m from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”\n\n‘What — what business could you have here?” Orton asked weakly.\n\n“I’ll explain that,” Forde replied, his tone a little brisk now. “But suppose I step into the space back there behind the counter where we can sit down and talk things over.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nForty Thousand Dollars In Deposits\n\nWithout waiting for Orton’s consent he moved past the cage toward the rear and swung open the gate in the railing. His eyes were very alert now. There were two other exits from this space. One led into the cage and the other was a door that obviously led into a room in the rear of the bank. There was also, of course, the door that led into the vault. The vault door was still open.\n\nForde had already taken a chair when Orton came slowly from the cage, swinging the grilled door shut behind him. Orton hesitated a moment, then sat down in the chair that faced Forde.\n\n“The First National Bank of Clayville has been doing a very nice business lately, hasn’t it, Orton?” Forde began abruptly.\n\nOrton’s tongue flicked out and dampened his dry lips. “Well, yes,” he admitted. ‘We’re not complaining any. But that isn’t remarkable. We always do a pretty good business at this season of the year.”\n\n“Do your deposits always take a jump at this season of the year, too?” Forde demanded.\n\nOrton’s right hand instinctively went to his collar band, loosened it. “Just–just what are you driving at?”\n\n“I’m asking you about your deposits, Orton,” Forde said tersely. “I think you know exactly what I’m driving at, but I’ll be plainer. You have, within the last week, increased your deposits substantially, haven’t you?”\n\n“Only — only a trifle,” Orton faltered. “Our deposits have gone up a little, but — “\n\n“I’m not referring to the total amount of your deposits, Orton!” Forde interrupted, and his voice was harsh now. “I’m referring to special deposits made by special parties — in very unusual sums for a village of this size.”\n\nOrton moved his head and neck uncomfortably. His lips parted, then closed again without speaking.\n\n“I am reliably informed,” Forde went on, “that normally you carry around five thousand in cash in this bank to take care of the village business. When your cash gets beyond that amount you ship it to larger banks nearby where you can draw on it when you need it. Is that right?”\n\nOrton blinked, then nodded confirmation.\n\n“During the early part of this week,” Forde went on relentlessly, “you forwarded forty thousand dollars in currency. You shipped twenty thousand to one bank, twenty thousand to another.”\n\n“The money was deposited by customers of the bank,” Orton offered nervously. “The books will show that.”\n\n“I don’t doubt it,” Forde said dryly. “I don’t doubt that your records are above reproach. I don’t doubt that the deposits were actually made in the same denominations, in the same currency, that you shipped on to the other banks. It was all in five, tens, and twenties. In the whole forty thousand there was not a single one-dollar bill, nor a fifty. Isn’t that a bit remarkable?”\n\n“I don’t think so.”\n\nOrton’s face was red now. He seemed to have lost some of his nervousness, and his eyes showed determination to keep control of himself.\n\n“I hardly ever see a bill as large as a fifty in this bank. And the smaller bills are generally kept by the merchants to make change.”\n\nForde leaned forward a little.\n\n“But your merchants never saw any of that currency that you shipped out this week, did they?” he asked softly. “That money wasn’t deposited by any of your regular customers, was it?”\n\n“No. No, it wasn’t.”\n\nOrton’s eyes showed a little defiance now. “But what difference does that make? A bank is more or less of a public institution. We try to extend our accommodations to all who ask for it.”\n\n“Of course, of course,” Forde conceded. “And just who were the parties you accommodated in this case? Who was it that walked into this bank and planked down forty thousand dollars in currency? No citizen of Clayville, I’ll gamble.”\n\n“No, the parties didn’t live in Clayville.”\n\n“You mean that there was more than one person that deposited that money, Orton?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nMob Money\n\nBert Orton delayed his answer a fraction of a second. During that fraction of a second his eyes went in a fleeting glance to that door that led into the room at the rear of the bank. Then his eyes were meeting Forde’s again.\n\n“There was more than one person,” he said flatly. “There were four persons. Each one deposited ten thousand dollars. The books show that.”\n\n“I won’t dispute your books — for the time being,” Forde told him with a touch of sarcasm. “At the same time, I’ll admit I’m surprised to hear it. I was quite sure that I would find the money was all deposited by one person.”\n\n“What — what would make you think that?”\n\n“The fact that the forty thousand dollars came from a common fund, Orton–a fund that was presumably under the control of one man.”\n\n“You mean,” Orton’s voice was hollow, “that you think there was something wrong with that money?”\n\n“Wrong?” Forde snorted. “There was plenty wrong with it. It was mob money. It came from one of the dirtiest crimes ever committed in this country — the Wainright snatch. But,” his tone dropped until it was softly insinuating, “I wonder if it’s any news to you. I wonder if you didn’t have a pretty good idea where that jack came from when it was passed over the counter to you.”\n\n“I didn’t know anything about it,” Orton denied steadily. “Perhaps it did occur to me that it was a bit unusual that four strangers should choose this bank for such deposits. But it was all in the ordinary course of business. I wouldn’t refuse to accept deposits unless I had a substantial basis to believe something was wrong.”\n\n“I guessed that would be your story, Orton. We’ll see. Maybe you can give me a good description of the four persons who made the deposits. I’m waiting.”\n\nOrton gulped and cleared his throat. Again his eyes went to the door of that rear room in a darting, apprehensive glance.\n\n“They were men — all four of them. They came in together, said something about having just concluded a cash sale. Said they wanted to deposit here and check it out as they needed it. I’ve got the deposit slips and their signatures on file in the — “\n\n“But the descriptions, Orton,” Ford© interrupted firmly. “Can you give me the descriptions of those four men?”\n\n“It ain’t necessary, you lousy Fed!” a voice crackled from Forde’s left rear. “I’m all four of ‘em. Take a good look at me and you got your descriptions.”\n\nJim Forde slowly turned his head, saw first the threatening muzzles of the two leveled guns, then the taut, snarling face of the man who held the guns. The man was of medium height, thin-shouldered, black-haired and black-eyed. The lines of his face were sharp and cruel. Obviously he had made his entrance from the room at the rear.\n\n“It’s your tough luck!” he snapped at Orton, whose face had gone white. “We were playin’ you for a sucker both ways, though, so it can’t make much diff to you. … So the Wainright money was tabbed, was it? Well, that was our play — to find out. How,” he demanded of Forde, “was it spotted?”\n\n“Serial numbers,” Forde said calmly.\n\n“The dirty rat!” the gunman exploded. “Old man Wainright crossed us. He swore by all that was holy that the money wasn’t tabbed in any way. He was so frantic about the kid that we thought he was on the level about it. Still, we wasn’t takin’ all the chances. We talked Orton here into shovin’ a bit of the jack for us to see if it was all right. So we’re out forty grand of it and the rest is so hot we won’t know what to do with it. It’s a laugh. I’ll bet you G-guys threw a duck fit when you found out forty grand of the Wainright dough had showed up?”\n\n“It created something of a sensation,” Forde admitted with a smile. “We were expecting some of it to be passed — but not in such large quantities.”\n\n“That was Red’s bright idea!” the mobster snarled. “Red figured the jack was okay, so he decided we might as well shoot the works on a big scale and find out. He’ll blow up when he gets the news. Now, stand up — both of you. Hands high!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Vault and the Gunman’s Escape\n\nForde remained motionless as the gunman cautiously tapped him and removed his weapon from its shoulder holster. The gunman stepped back.\n\n“Into the vault — both of you!” He followed them, both guns again in his hands. “Get on back in!” he ordered as they hesitated, just inside the vault door.\n\nHe laughed loudly as they backed on into the far end of the vault.\n\n“It ain’t so bad from our angle as you might guess it is, Orton,” he boasted. “I’m goin’ to take that five grand or so in currency that you keep in the cage. It ain’t no sudden thought, either. I been all set to play it that way if anything went wrong. It’ll kinda balance things up for the forty grand we tossed off. All right, Mister G-man. See if you’re smart enough to get out of here.”\n\nHe swung the vault door shut, pulled down the lever, and spun the dial. He showed his teeth in a grin as he holstered his guns.\n\nHe reached in his inside pocket and removed a round piece of paper that was red on one side. He licked the opposite side with his tongue, crossed to the window, and pressed the paper against the window glass, held it there for a moment until it stuck securely.\n\nHe turned and ran to the cage, slipped the grilled door back, went inside and stuffed the currency that he removed from the drawers into his pockets. He left the cage and went to a position near the door of the rear room. From there he could observe the street without being seen. He waited hardly more than two minutes. He grinned again as the black coupé came into view.\n\nHe ran into the rear room and unlatched the side door that opened on the street. He opened it, closed it behind him, stepped nimbly across the sidewalk and around the waiting coupé. He climbed in beside the white-faced girl who sat beneath the wheel.\n\n“Step on it, kid!” he commanded.\n\n“What happened?” she gasped.\n\n“Plenty, Winnie. It’s the old blow-off. A G-guy showed up and started askin’ the boy scout some pointed questions. I stepped in, accordin’ to the plan we already had worked out. I locked ‘em both in the vault, grabbed the dough, and beat it. I think I got better than four grand. Not so bad, huh? About the softest bank job that was ever pulled.”\n\n“Maybe and maybe not,” she commented coolly as the car left the village and shot at high speed into the open road. “The G-boys may be planted all over the landscape.”\n\n“I don’t think so,” he told her. “That G just happened to be the first one on the job. He hustled over to Clayville to see what kind of a smart job was bein’ pulled. He’d never dream that one of the mob was actually on the job, in the bank.”\n\n“I hope you’ve got it straight, Flint. Personally I’ll feel a lot better when we pull into Red’s hideout … .”\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nIt was pitch dark and very stuffy inside the small bank vault. The two men stood in silence for a minute or two.\n\n“You might as well give me some of the details, Orton,” Forde said. “How did the mob happen to pick on you to handle the Wainright money for them?”\n\n“It was through a girl named Winnie Lang,” Orton replied quickly. “I knew her pretty well about three years ago. She was a hostess in a dime-dance place in Capital City where I worked then. About ten days ago she came into the bank. She was dressed like a million dollars and talked about easy money. I was curious and played up to her. She evidently got the impression that I’d play the game. Of course, I didn’t dream that she was tied up with a mob. I thought she was hinting at some kind of a confidence game.\n\n“Four days later she came back with that gunman. His name is Flint Bovan.”\n\n“I knew him — from his picture,” Forde admitted.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Thing Was Fixes\n\n“Bovan evidently thought everything was fixed,” Orton continued. “He didn’t tell me where the money came from. He just told me how it was to be handled and told me what would happen to me if I crossed them. He laid the forty thousand down on my desk and told me to get busy. From that moment on he hardly let me out of his sight. He made me introduce him as my cousin to my housekeeper and other persons who might be suspicious. Every day he sat in that rear room. I wasn’t permitted to phone unless he was listening. When he wasn’t with me, Winnie Lang kept an eye on me. I don’t mind admitting that I was badly worried.”\n\n“I can imagine,” Forde chuckled. “It’s lucky for you that Sam Weisner was as smart as you thought he was. He might have blurted something out, exposed you, the first time you started scratching the dope on his deposit slips. I have no doubt that Flint Bovan would have shot you down if he had suspected that you were crossing him.”\n\n“He didn’t suspect a thing,” Orton said with satisfaction. “Sam is always in the bank four or five times a day anyway. I tried to get all the important dope written on those slips. I didn’t want some constable or deputy sheriff to rush in here, not knowing that Flint was waiting with his guns in the back room.”\n\nMuffled movements sounded on the other side of the vault door. “That will be Weisner now,” Forde said. “With Stillson, the president of your string of banks, with the combination to the vault door. In a minute we should be — “\n\nThey blinked as the vault door swung open.` Then they stepped uncertainly out into the light.\n\n“You boys all right?” Sam Weisner asked anxiously.\n\n“We’re all right,” Forde assured him. “No excitement outside, I hope.”\n\n“None at all,” Weisner stated, “I watched the bank, and it all happened just about as you said it would. That girl drove the black coupé up to the rear door, and the black-haired man jumped in. They went away fast. It’s over my head. I don’t understand why you didn’t have the place surrounded and grab them.”\n\n“Because Flint Bovan and Winnie Lang are only two members of the mob,” Forde explained with a smile. “There are four others, including Red Cordage, the brains of the mob and as desperate a criminal as there is in the country. We want Red. We want them all. Now there’s no need to let the rest of the townsfolk in on what has happened here this afternoon. They’ll get the whole story later if our plans work out according to schedule.\n\n“I suggest, Mr. Stillson, that you have another man here in the morning to take charge of the bank temporarily. Then if a member of the Red Cordage mob should take the trouble to see what has happened, he will conclude that Orton has been quietly arrested and removed for questioning. And Red Cordage, knowing that Orton can’t give any information that will be of the slightest help to the cops, will figure that his mob is in the clear.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nBig Red’s Hideout\n\nBig Red Cordage gulped down his whiskey and deposited the empty glass on the table.\n\n“Boy, this is the life!” he exclaimed boisterously. “We got all the comforts of home here, and we’ll take it easy till I can figure out another job. I used my head when I picked this joint for a hideout.”\n\nHis eyes wandered complacently over the large and comfortably furnished living room of the mountain cabin. The other members of his mob were scattered about the room, drinking and smoking. A radio blared dance music.\n\n“You sure did use your head, Red,” Flint Bovan agreed noisily. “You was smart in havin’ us come in separately and rent three cabins on the same hillside. That way, nobody would suspect nothin’ and they’d think it was perfectly natural for us to get acquainted and start partyin’ together. And there’s no trail for the Feds to follow.”\n\n“I’ll bet them Feds are madder as hell,” Red chortled. “When they found that Wainright jack floatin’ in the banks, they thought they had us. It never occurred to that dumb G that we’d have a man right in the bank checkin’ up. I’ll bet he choked when you walked in and shoved the gats in his face, Flint.”\n\n“Yeah, he did,” Flint smirked. “He looked like he was goin’ to drop right through the floor. But Wainright is the guy that gives me a headache. We ought to go back and bump him for handin’ us that tabbed jack. If he’d kept his word and given us straight dough we’d be sittin’ pretty now instead of havin’ a measly four grand — and it goin’ fast.”\n\n“Cripes, Flint!” Red growled. “Don’t bellyache about that four grand. It was a life saver. If it hadn’t been for that we’d be havin’ to take a chance and pass some of the rest of the Wainright dough. That would keep us hoppin’ around and would be plenty risky. Now we got that four grand of good bank dough to live on till I can figure out a quick play.”\n\nFlint glanced at his watch and rose to his feet.\n\n“Come on, Winnie,” he yawned. “It’s two A.M. and we might as well go back to our shack and hit the hay.”\n\nThe party broke up. Winnie strolled to the door of the living room, which opened on the front porch, and pulled it open. She stood there, staring out at the blackness of the mountainside, waiting for Flint to join her,\n\nFlint reached the door, turned and said: “So long, gang.” He took a step out on to the porch and started to close the door behind him.\n\nThe sound that blasted the stillness of the night came from directly in front of him, and to Flint and the men in the room behind him, it was unmistakably the sound of a pistol shot. Flint caught Winnie by the arm, jerked her back into the living room and kicked the door shut. The other men had leaped to their feet.\n\n“What the hell?” Flint rasped.\n\n“Take it easy!” Red Cordage snapped, “just stay where you are for a minute and see what happens. Ten to one it was just a hill-billy on his way home, lit up and celebratin’.”\n\nThey waited in silence for perhaps two minutes. Then Red grinned and relaxed.\n\n“That was it,” he said confidently. “One of these yokels, lit up on corn, cut loose with his rod to show his good spirits. All right, Flint. Try It again. You and Winnie walk right out the front door and go on to your cabin.”\n\nFlint warily opened the door and thrust his head out. He blinked at the darkness. There was no sound or movement out there. He threw the door open.\n\n“Come on, Winnie. Red was right. It was a false — “\n\nHe leaped backward as orange jets of flame spurted from the blackness in front of him. The roar of a sub-machine gun echoed deafeningly up the mountainside. Two short bursts that splintered the lattice work beneath the porch. Then silence again.\n\n“Douse the lights!” Big Red yelled as Flint leaped back inside. “Get the guns! Make for the back door! We got to fight our way out!”\n\nThe mobsters grabbed their guns and piled through the short hall that led to the kitchen and the rear porch. But they had hardly reached the kitchen when a second sub-machine gun chattered from the woods beyond the clearing at the rear of the house.\n\nThe cabin was suddenly illuminated by wavering white lights that seeped in at the windows and cast ghastly shadows in the rooms. The mobsters rushed back into the living room and shrank against the inner wall.\n\nFlares! Blazing white light burning from the ground on each side of the cabin made the clearing an oasis of brilliance in the blackness.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nYou Tipped Us Yourselves\n\nThere was absolute silence again in the timber beyond the clearing.\n\n“You can all have one guess!” Red Cordage snarled. “We’re in a spot. If we walk out of any door or try to make it from a window, they’ll knock us off before we get started. I think I get the idea. They’re gonna hold us here like this till daylight, then make us give up or gun us. So what are we gonna do?”\n\n“We can make a run for it — go out shootin’,” Flint suggested.\n\n“Yeah, we can do that,” Red agreed. “We all boasted that we’d never be taken alive. But when a guy says that he’ll never be taken alive he means that he’ll shoot it out with the cops if he’s got so much as a long chance. Here — we ain’t got a chance. All of you that want to commit suicide, march right on out and try to run those flares. Personally, I’m goin’ to wait for daylight and see what happens.”\n\nBig Red guessed right. No more flares came from the timber when it was light enough to see.\n\nJim Forde bellowed his ultimatum through a megaphone. He gave the mob ten minutes to think it over. They walked out in two minutes, Big Red leading the procession with his hands high above his head. The G-men closed in, searched them and cuffed them together.\n\n“Who tipped you that we was holed up here?” Red asked.\n\n“You tipped us yourselves,” Forde chuckled.\n\n“How?”\n\n“The way you handled the money. You see, Red, Bert Orton wasn’t quite the sucker that you thought he was. He tipped off the situation in the bank by writing notes on the deposit slips of the bank’s best customer, Sam Weisner. Sam called us. When I walked into the bank just before closing time I knew the setup, knew from the description that Orton gave and the fact that forty grand was being floated, that it was Flint Bovan who was parked in the back office, that it was your mob behind the play. I could easily have grabbed Flint and Winnie right there, but I wanted the whole mob — you in particular.”\n\n“I don’t get it,” Red growled. “You didn’t manage to tail Flint and Winnie to this hideout?”\n\n“No, I didn’t. But I guessed just what would happen if I walked in the bank and started asking Orton questions. I guessed that Flint, if he was sure that I was alone, would grab the cash in the till and beat it. That’s what he did.”\n\nRed stared, a large question in his eyes.\n\n“So just before closing time I had Sam Weisner go into the bank and pretend to make a deposit. Instead of making a deposit, he made a trade with Orton. Orton slipped him the currency that was in the drawer. Weisner slipped Orton a little over four thousand in currency-currency that was marked in a manner that any banker could detect at a glance. Before that trade was made, the necessary information was on the way to every bank in this section of the country. When some of that money showed up at the bank at Green Falls, just eight miles from here, we got busy in short order. You spent that bank dough freely, never suspecting that it could be traced. You bought groceries, a radio, tires — “\n\n“I get it,” Red grimaced. “It was a cinch for you to ask the yokels questions and spot us here. It’s our tough luck. We were hooked all around on tabbed jack. I’d like to get my hands on that two-timin’ Wainright. He crossed us after we handed him back his kid just like we promised we’d — “\n\n“That’s another little mistake you made, Red,” Forde grinned. “Wainright didn’t cross you. You could have passed that money anywhere in the country without the slightest risk. The money was not marked. The numbers weren’t taken. But it was a cinch to figure out that it was the Wainright money that you were putting through. Even without Orton’s description of Flint, we would have known it. We’ve pretty well cleaned up the snatch mobs. The Wainright job was the only unsolved case that involved as much as forty grand.”\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "I shouldn’t have done it to Obie. I keep telling myself that he’s really better off, that he might come to even worse end if it hadn’t happened the way it did, but I know that isn’t true. I know I played a dirty trick on the only guy who ever really loved me and I know I’ll remember it as long as I live and think about it the last thing before I die. I keep thinking how he loved to work in the fields under the hot sun with sweat seeping through his rough blue shirt in a great dark stain until the whole shirt was sopping wet, and about how he used to take a dip afterwards in the deep pool at the bend of the creek and then sit naked on the bank like a small, innocent boy and watch the shifting pattern of sunlight and shade and listen to the stirrings and splashings of small life along the bank and in the water. You can’t do things like that where Obie is now. Not in a mad house.\n\nHe isn’t really crazy, no matter what they said. It’s just that he isn’t bright. I don’t know much about the technical gradations of intelligence, but I guess you’d call Obie an imbecile, maybe. He was a good worker, but you always had to tell him exactly what to do. You’d tell him to get the ax, he’d get the ax. You’d tell him to chop some wood, he’d chop some wood. Then, unless you’d tell him to put the ax away, he’d leave it right out in the God damn rain or anything else. The only time he ever went ahead and did something on his own, without being told just what, was the time I’m telling about, the time I played the dirty trick on him. It got pretty trying sometimes, telling him just every little thing to do that way, and I lost my temper and cursed him more times than I can count, but I regret it now, and wish I hadn’t done it, and most of all I wish I hadn’t done what I did in the end to get him put away. I miss Obie. It’s lonely around here without him.\n\nIt happened the day I heard him singing Two little Hands out behind the barn. Two little Hands is a religious song, a kind of hymn, I guess, and it’s all about someone having two little hands for Jesus, and it’s supposed to be sung by kids in Sunday School and places like that. Someone had got hold of Obie early and taught him a few simple things about religion, and he was always singing this little song that he’d picked up somewhere. He only knew a few lines, because that was all he was capable of remembering, but he liked to sing what he knew, and he sang it every time he thought to, or someone asked him to, and it was sort of funny and sad at the same time to hear the big lug do it, especially because his hands were really about the size of a brace of snow scoops.\n\nI heard him singing this song behind the barn, and then I heard someone start to laugh as if it was the funniest God-damn thing that ever happened. There were two voices laughing, that is, a man’s and a woman’s, and I knew it was Ivy and Gunner Hoke back there with Obie. I began to feel sick then, partly because I didn’t like anyone poking fun at Obie, but mostly because it was Ivy and Gunner doing it. Ivy was my step-sister, no blood relation, and Gunner was a tall lean guy from in town who came out to see her. He was doing more than seeing her, too. I knew that as well as anything, even though I couldn’t actually prove it, and for a long time I kidded myself that I hated Gunner for that reason, because I didn’t approve of such goings-on, but now I that I’m making a clean breast of everything and telling the whole story, I may as well admit that it was really because I wanted to take Ivy for myself and never could.\n\nShe was enough to make anyone want to. Gunner and I weren’t the only ones by any means, and so far as I know maybe Gunner wasn’t the only one who managed it. She did everything she could to put it in a guy’s mind, that was sure. She was certain to be sloppy fat someday, like her old lady, my stepmother, but now her body was just full and ready, like it had been tree-ripened in the hot summer sun for picking, and it had a way of projecting itself through the thin cottons she wore around the place. She knew the effect she had on me, all right, I wasn’t fooling her any, and she got a hell of a bang out of it even though she never intended to give me any house. I guess I hated her in a way just as much as I hated Gunner, but I’m trying to be honest, and I can’t be sure, because it was all mixed up with my wanting her the way I did.\n\nI went around behind the barn, and there was Obie singing this little song about two little hands for Jesus, and he was standing like a kid speaking a piece for the parents on the last day of school, with his big feet together in the dust and his huge, bony hands hanging down at his sides below knobby wrists that looked like they’d been swollen and crippled by arthritis. He had a pained look on his face, just like he always got when he sang, his pale eyes staring straight in front of him and filled with a kind of misery, as if it hurt him to try to remember the words in the order they were supposed to come. Tears were rolling down his cheeks, and his slack mouth that was never quite closed, even when he wasn’t talking or singing, leaked saliva at the corners, and the saliva ran down over his chin. He was a big, lank guy at least three inches over six feet, and his bones were thick and knobby at all the joints just like at the wrists, and /e looked like just what he was, a big boob without the brains to know when someone was making a damn fool of him, but I didn’t think it was funny.\n\nIvy and Gunner did, though. They were leaning against the barn with their arms around each other, and they were laughing fit to kill. Ivy with an abandon that was almost hysteria and Gunner more quietly, in his own way, his bright red lips drawn back off white teeth in an expression that was somehow canine and cruel.\n\nI went over and grabbed Obie by an arm and jerked him around. His song ended with a little squawk in his throat, and he stood looking down at me with his mouth hanging open and his pale eyes clouded and confused in the wav they got when anything happened too suddenly or was a little different from anything that had happened to him before.\n\n“What’d you do that for, Jake?” he said. “I was singing my song for Ivy. You oughtn’t to stop me when I’m singing my song for Ivy.”\n\n“God damn it,” I said, “can’t you tell when someone’s making a damn clown out of you? Haven’t you even got that much brains?”\n\nHe shook his head slowly from side to side, laboring to understand what I’d said, taking each word one at a time in the darkness of his brain and figuring it and then putting them all together at the end like a little kid just learning to read.\n\n“You oughtn’t to say that, Jake. Ivy’s my girl. You know Ivy’s my girl. Ivy wouldn’t do anything like that to Obie.”\n\n“Don’t be any more of a fool than God intended you to be, Obie. Ivy’s just stringing you along. She’s Gunner’s girl, not yours. Why would she laugh at you if she wasn’t? Why would she stand there laughing at you and letting Gunner laugh with her right in front of you if she wasn’t?”\n\nIt was true that Ivy teased Obie. She was cruel by instinct, and it gave her a big bang to work him up to the point where he was leaking saliva through his loose lips and shaking like a bird dog evacuating peach seeds, and you’d have thought it was a dangerous game for her, that a big powerful guy with no brains to evaluate consequences might have just slapped her down and had what he wanted, but she knew it wouldn’t happen because Obie had this simple religion in him and a rudimentary kind of morality that had been drilled into him for his own protection that said you never bothered anyone, least of all a woman, and that any kind of physical intimacy, no matter how bad you wanted it, was evil and strictly taboo. He’d never have touched Ivy, or Gunner, either, if it hadn’t been for me. Never on earth.\n\nHe swung his head around and looked at Ivy and Gunner by the barn.\n\n“Gunner oughtn’t to do that to Ivy. Ivy doesn’t like it. Ivy wouldn’t even like Obie to do something like that.”\n\nGunner let his hand slip off her and stepped forward, bending a little at the waist like a man ready to attack. He was looking at me, not Obie, and his eyes were as black and shiny as two chips of anthracite, and his face, though he had quit laughing, had the same expression as before, his red lips drawn back in the shape of cruel pleasure without sound. Ivy, in an unconscious gesture, lifted her hands to her armpits and ran them down the sidelines of her body as if she enjoyed the feel of herself.\n\nShe said softly, “Don’t pay any attention to Jake, Obie. He’s just jealous. He’s jealous because I’m your girl instead of his.”\n\nObie shook his head again, his sparse dry hair falling down over his eyes. No. Jake’s Obie’s friend, Jake’s Obie’s friend, and Ivy’s Obie’s girl.”\n\nIt was as simple as that to the big boob. He couldn’t see any conflict. He couldn’t sec any reason at all why it shouldn’t be that way.\n\nGunner laughed with a sound that was no more than a long breath hissing through his teeth, “Jake’s a sneaky little mouse, that’s what he is. Jake’s a slimy, panting little jerk who can’t get what he wants and doesn’t want anyone else to get it.\n\nMy hate was too big for me then, and I stepped forward and started to swing at him, but he was much too fast for me and hit me flush in the mouth, and I was suddenly on my back in the hot, dry dust with blood in my throat. After fifteen seconds or so, I got up to do the best I could, but it wasn’t necessary, because Obie was standing between me and Gunner, and his huge hands were clenching and unclenching slowly.\n\n“Don’t hit Jake again,” he said to Gunner. “Don’t hit Jake and don’t touch Ivy.”\n\nGunner was lean and mean and fast as hell, but he didn’t want any part of Obie. Obie would simply have waded into him and taken him in his big hands and crushed the life out of him, and Gunner knew it. In his eyes were fear and sudden withdrawal, but in Ivy’s eyes there was nothing but the crazy, shining excitement that was always her reaction to violence or the sight of blood as the symbol of violence.\n\n“Come on, Obie,” I said. “Let’s cut out. I want you to help me down in the fields.”\n\nI took him by an arm and led him down the cowpath into the pasture at the lower end and across the pasture toward the creek, and all the way he kept turning his head every few steps to look back toward Ivy and Gunner by the barn, and I could tell he was trying to figure it out, what had happened and why I had stopped him from finishing his song and why we had all said and done the things we had. My lips were split and beginning to swell, and one tooth was so loose that I could push it around with my tongue, but that wasn’t what hurt. A few cuts and bruises didn’t matter a damn. What hurt was the festering hatred and humiliation inside me that made me want to vomit and was all the worse because I couldn’t think of anything to do about it. At the edge of the timber along the creek I stopped and looked back myself, and I could see Ivy and Gunner walk across the barnyard and into the barn with their arms around each other, and I knew all of a sudden without any doubt at all just what they were going in there for. I think I knew because I understood that it would be necessary for Ivy to complete the cycle of intense physical excitement that the brief episode of violence and blood had aroused but hadn’t satisfied.\n\n“What we stopping for, Jake?” Obie said. “I thought we were going to the fields.”\n\nIf he hadn’t said that, maybe I wouldn’t have done it. Maybe just a little thing like his saying something at the wrong time was the difference between doing it and not doing it.\n\n“I just remembered that we’ll need a pitch fork, Obie,” I said. “Go back to the barn and get one.”\n\n“What we need a pitch fork for?”\n\n“Never mind that. Just go get it. It’s sticking in the hay in the loft.” He started back the way we had come, and when he’d gone a few steps, I said, “Wait a minute, Obie. Listen to me. You be real quiet going in the barn. Don’t let anyone see you or hear you. You understand?”\n\nHis eyes got clouded and confused from the effort of trying to understand why I was telling him to get the fork in a way that was different from the way I had always told him to get it before.\n\n“Why, Jake? Why don’t you want anyone to see me?”\n\n“Never mind. I’ve got my reason. Will you do it the way I say?”\n\n“Sure, Jake. If you say so.”\n\n“Don’t forget, now. Promise?”\n\n“Sure, Jake. I promise.”\n\nHe turned and started again, and I stood and watched him, watched his long, loping gait eat up the distance to Ivy and Gunner in the barn, and then I went on through the trees to the bank of the creek and sat down. I gathered a handful of pebbles and threw them one at a time into the dark green water, watching the little concentric circles move outward from the place where the pebble went in, and then, after the water had smoothed out, I lay back on the bank and closed my eyes and began to count, and I had counted a long way, I don’t remember how far except that it was a long way, when I heard Obie’s big clod-hoppers thumping the ground, and he came through the trees and sat beside me. He was breathing very hard. His breath was like a whinny in his nostrils.\n\nWithout opening my eyes, I said, “You get the fork, Obie?”\n\n“Fork?”\n\n“What’s the matter, Obie?”\n\nHe didn’t answer, and I guess he didn’t even hear me, but after a while he said more to himself than to me, “He oughtn’t to have done it. She oughtn’t to have let him.”\n\nI knew then that it was both of them. I knew that he had seen what I’d sent him to see and that he’d done what I’d thought he might do. I couldn’t stand the sight of him sitting there crying, so I rolled over and buried my face in my arms, but I could still see him just the same, and I can still see him now and I only wish they had, in the place where he is, a field where he could work under the hot sun with his big hands, and a creek where he could go when the work was finished.\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "Clarence Stierwalt, a young man with a purpose, stood at the “World’s Busiest Corner” State and Madison Streets, Chicago — in serious meditation.\n\nIt was twenty minutes past four o’clock on Monday afternoon, October 9, 1939.\n\nThe crowds swirled and eddied around him, but Clarence paid them no heed. Clarence was cogitating on a matter of grave concern. He had a small bit of money in his pocket and he needed a great deal more. But he was newly released from state’s prison and had arrived in Chicago from Paducah, Kentucky, only a few hours before, and among the countless thousands of persons streaming endlessly past him there wasn’t one that he knew. How, then, could he get this money?\n\nHe turned and stared intently at the nearest store. Then he walked inside and exchanged the money in his pocket for a small bright object of curious design. He thrust the object in the lower pocket of his vest, buttoned his coat over it and walked back to the teeming street.\n\nHe floated along with the milling crowd and stopped in front of another store a few doors farther south. This was Berland’s Shoe Store at 16 South State Street.\n\nHe went inside. The store was swarming with customers. The manager, Sam Bloomberg, stepped forward smilingly.\n\n“Something in shoes, sir?” said Mr. Bloomberg.\n\n“No,” said Clarence, unbuttoning his coat. “Something in cash.”\n\nHe pointed to the shining object protruding from his vest.\n\nMr. Bloomberg’s eyes widened at the object; a snubnosed automatic pistol.\n\n“This is a stick-up. I want all the money you got in this joint,” said Clarence, speaking low from a corner of his mouth, “and I want it, quick.”\n\n“Step this way,” said Mr. Bloomberg, and led him to the cashier’s cage.\n\n“Miss Kay,” he said to” the cashier, “give this man what he wants. And please don’t alarm the other — customers.”\n\nThere was $250 in the till. Miss Rose Kay, the cashier, gave it all to Clarence.\n\nClarence shoved it into his pockets and buttoned his coat. Then he bowed to the cashier and lifted his hat, and turned and walked outside. Nobody else in the store was aware that it was being robbed. So it was as simple as that!\n\nEmerging to the sidewalk, somewhat hurriedly, Clarence collided with another man.\n\n“Hey!” exploded this man. “Can’t you watch where you’re going?”\n\n“Sorry,” said Clarence. “I’m in a hurry.” He started to push on through the crowd.\n\nBut the man detained him. “Say,” he said, looking curiously at Clarence’s face, “haven’t we met somewhere before? St. Louis, I think it was.”\n\n“I’ve never been in St. Louis,” said Clarence. “If we met at all it was in Paducah.”\n\n“But I’ve never been in Paducah,” said the man.\n\nClarence had the vague feeling he had heard something like this before, and he was about to supply the last line to the gag: “It must have been two other fellows,” but now, suddenly, he heard a shout behind ‘him:\n\n“Hold that man! Don’t let him get away!”\n\nClarence looked over his shoulder. Policeman Martin Sullivan, on traffic duty at State and Madison, was barging toward him through the crowd, elbowing people right and left, service revolver in hand. Following him was Manager Sam Bloomberg.\n\nClarence tried to run, but he hadn’t a chance. The stranger, who thought they had met in St. Louis, held him in a bearlike grip.\n\nA moment later Officer Sullivan was clamping the handcuffs on him. The stranger, having performed his duty as a citizen, disappeared in the crowd without giving his name. Probably he was still pondering on how he could have met Clarence when he had never been in Paducah.\n\nMr. Bloomberg, watching excitedly, uttered a warning: “Take care, Officer. He’s got a gun in his pocket.”\n\nOfficer Sullivan, preparing to take his prisoner to the call box and send him to the Detective Bureau, jerked open Clarence’s coat and snatched the snub-nosed pistol from the lower vest pocket. Then he gave a hearty laugh. It was a toy cap pistol such as children use when playing “cops and robbers.”\n\nClarence had bought it with his last thirty-five cents.\n\nTHE END\nBack to Top\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  The First Guess\n  The Second Guess\n  The Third Guess\n  Back to Tess Rillette’s\n  It’s the Harry Duggin Case\n  A Late Double Feature\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe First Guess\n\nIt was one of those white stone places up in the east seventies.\n\nPlenty of class, Frey thought as he walked up the steps. He turned and looked at the guy waiting in the car. He shrugged, and the guy shrugged back.\n\nFrey was in his early thirties. He was five eight and he weighed 170 and it was packed in like steel. He was a private dick and he was reckless. It showed in his grey eyes and the glint in his carelessly combed light brown hair and the set of his jawline. It showed in the thin grin of his lips.\n\nHis lips grinned like that as the door opened. A servant, a Jap.\n\n“Yes, please?”\n\n“I’d like to see Miss Rillette.”\n\n“She busy.”\n\n“Not too busy to see me,” Frey said. “I’m coming in.”\n\nJaps are either very tough or they are very timid, and the servant was of the latter stamp. He stepped aside and Frey walked through a pale orange room, then through a burnt orange room and then into another pale orange room.\n\n“Nice place you’ve got here, Miss Rillette,” Frey said.\n\nShe was small and slim and even in the frock of a sculptress she looked delicate and graceful. In one hand she held a chisel. In the other she held a mallet. She was working on a chunk of marble and she had the forehead and general scalp contours almost completed.\n\nWhen she turned around she showed a good looking set of features. She had dark brown hair coming in bangs to the eyebrows, and her eyes were gold-hazel. Her mouth was a little too wide, but still she was a good looking girl. She was in her late twenties.\n\n“Just who are you and what is the meaning of this?” she said.\n\n“My name is Frey, and I’m a friend of Harry Duggin.”\n\n“Is that so?” she said. “How is Harry?”\n\n“He’s dead.”\n\nShe blinked a few times and then she said, “What happened — and when?”\n\nFrey said, “He was murdered — this morning. Knifed.”\n\nShe blinked a few more times and then she looked at the floor for a few seconds. Frey was watching her and then he was glancing sideways to a little jade box that held cigarettes. He took one up, eased a stray safety match from his vest pocket, flicked it with his fingernail, and lit up.\n\nHe took a few deep drags and said, “I got an idea that you know something, Miss Rillette.”\n\nHer face showed no emotion as she said, “I thought you said you were a friend of Harry’s. You sound more like a detective.”\n\n“That’s right. Harry was a good friend of mine. We went to law school together. He became a successful corporation lawyer and I starved for a while and then I became a private detective. I lost touch with Harry for a year or so and then last week he called me up and asked me to do a favor for him. He asked me to follow you.”\n\nShe said, “Indeed?”\n\n“That’s right. He must have been looking around for a private dick and then he found out that I was in business and he asked me to follow you. He said that in return for the favor he would give me one hundred and fifty bucks. So you see, Miss Rillette, I have nothing against you personally. I just have to make a living, that’s all.”\n\n“Why did he want you to follow me?”\n\n“You don’t have to ask me that. Miss Rillette. You know the answer. In fact, you know all the answers. I found that out through seven days of following you.”\n\nShe blinked some more and then she reached out to the little jade box and took a cigarette. Frey flicked one of his safety matches with his fingernail and gave her a light.\n\n“What am I supposed to say?” she murmured.\n\nHe knew he was going to have trouble with this girl.\n\n“You don’t have to say anything. I’ll write out a confession outline and you sign it. If you want to, you can fill all the gaps. But what I want most is a signed confession — “\n\n“What did you say you were?” she murmured.\n\n“A private detective.”\n\n“Beginner, aren’t you?”\n\nThat made him sort of sore. But he swallowed it and said, “Maybe, but I’m not an amateur. I make a living out of this.”\n\nShe blinked and dragged half-heartedly at the cigarette and then she turned and looked at the marble she was doing. She looked back at Frey and her eyes were tired as she said, “How close did you follow me?”\n\n“Here’s what you did,” Frey said. ‘On Sunday you attended an exhibition at the Wheye Galleries, up on 57th Street. From there you went to Larry’s, in the Village, where you had a dinner engagement with a man named Lasseroe. From there this guy took you to a party at the Vanderbilt. He went home alone. You stayed at the Vanderbilt. You stayed there for five days, with your very good friend, Daisy Hennifer, the jewelry designer. You had a few luncheon and dinner engagements with Lasseroe. You went to a few shops with Daisy. Then early last night you left the Vanderbilt and I lost you in Fifth Avenue traffic. I went back to tell Harry about it and to get your home address, because in all the days I’d been following you — well, you didn’t once touch home. When I got to Harry’s apartment, his valet informed me that Harry was out for the evening.”\n\n“That’s as far as you got?”\n\n“Hardly. I went to Harry’s apartment again this morning. The valet came to the door and told me that Mr. Duggin was sleeping. I explained that it was certainly most important and I went in. But I couldn’t wake Harry up, because he was dead. I don’t know why I’m telling you all this. You know it already.”\n\n“How did you get my home address?” She was still blinking a lot, but she wasn’t excited.\n\n“The valet gave it to me.”\n\n“You told him — ?”\n\n“I didn’t tell him anything. I came out of the bedroom and told him that Mr. Duggin was still sleeping. Then I asked him for your address. Maybe he still thinks that Harry is asleep. Or maybe he’s found out already and the police are in on the case.”\n\nShe looked at the ceiling and then she looked at the floor and then she looked at Frey and said, “Now let me understand this. You say that I murdered Harry. You want me to sign a confession.”\n\n“That’s all there is to it,” he said. “You’re going to place yourself in a lot of difficulty, Mr. Frey,” she murmured. “I advise that you give this matter a little more thought before you accuse anyone else — “\n\n“I’m not accusing anyone else,” Frey said. “What are you going to do?”\n\nShe blinked and then she looked at her wrist watch and then she looked at the marble.\n\n“I have a lot of work to finish before three thirty this afternoon,” she said. “Please go now.”\n\nShe turned, took up her mallet and chisel, and started to work on the marble. She acted as if Frey had already walked out of the pale orange room.\n\nHe shrugged and walked out.\n\nThe Jap servant followed him to the door. He said to the Jap, “Tell Miss Rillette that I’ll be back — after three thirty.” He walked down the steps and stepped into the parked coupe.\n\nHe turned the key in the ignition lock and said, “No go.”\n\n“What happened?” this other guy said. This other guy was Mogin. He was about as tall as Frey and he weighed a little over 200 pounds. He had close-cropped blond hair and pretty blue eyes and he was a very tough boy.\n\n“She don’t know from nothing,” Frey said. He took the car around the corner and stepped on the gas.\n\n“What do we do now?” Mogin said.\n\n“Well, we could go to a double feature and kill the afternoon that way. Or we could go up and visit this Lasseroe.”\n\nMogin shrugged.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Second Guess\n\nIt was a new apartment house near Morningside Heights. It was elegant and smooth and important.\n\n“Do I wait?” Mogin said.\n\n“Maybe you better come in with me.”\n\nThey went in and rang Lasseroe’s number and he must have been expecting somebody because he buzzed an answer right away and the door opened. When Frey and Mogin stepped out of the elevator, Lasseroe was standing at the door of his apartment and when he saw them he expected them to walk right by. But they came up to him.\n\nHe was a man of medium height and he had a good build for a man of forty-five. He had a square, rigid-boned face, and deep-set dark grey eyes, and a good head of black hair threaded with silver. He was wearing a long collared silk shirt and an expensive cravat and an expensive silk lounging robe.\n\n“Hello, Lasseroe,” Frey said.\n\n“I beg your pardon — “\n\n“You don’t have to beg anybody’s pardon,” Frey said. “All you have to do is answer a few questions. If you don’t mind we won’t waste time out here in the hall. We’ll go into your room and talk.”\n\n“I presume you are thieves?” Lasseroe said. He wasn’t excited.\n\n“No, we ain’t thieves and we don’t like funny boys,” Mogin said.\n\nLasseroe walked into the apartment and Frey and Mogin followed.\n\n“Now, gentlemen?”\n\n“My name is Frey. This is my assistant, Mr. Mogin.”\n\nLasseroe ignored Mogin.\n\nHe said, “What do you want with me?”\n\nFrey began to talk. He didn’t look at Lasseroe. He looked out the window and talked slowly, taking his time.\n\nHe said, “You got a nice business, Mr. Lasseroe. You are an expert appraiser of art, and you take good fees from various dealers. Sometimes you hit healthy money. You check up on a Rembrandt and you give your okay to a buyer and the dealer gives you a sweet kick-back. It is all very legitimate and lucrative — “\n\n“What are you, a census taker?” Lasseroe said.\n\n“Quiet,” Mogin toned.\n\n“A short time ago you figured out a few new angles,” Frey said. “You weren’t doing so good on the old stuff and you reasoned that you might be able to make up for the deficiency by a few transactions with the modern boys and girls.”\n\n“Just what do you mean by — “\n\n“Quiet,” Mogin toned.\n\n“So here’s what you did,” Frey said. “You rounded up several of the more snooty painters and sculptors — the artistic boys and girls who have a lot of dough because their parents or some uncle or somebody had a lot of dough. You told the suckers that you’d boost their work in return for tribute. Then you went to the dealers and told them that you had several sensational new artists whose work would bring high prices. You’d give that work a big build-up in return for the kick-backs. It worked.”\n\n“Now just a moment — “\n\n“Quiet,” Mogin toned.\n\n“Everybody was happy,” Frey said, “because nobody really lost out. The artists made dough and the dealers made dough and the customers thought they were getting high class stuff. One of these customers was Harry Duggin, the successful corporation lawyer.”\n\nLasseroe opened his mouth to say something. Then he closed it and looked at Frey and looked at Mogin and looked at Frey again.\n\n“You sold Duggin a few pieces of sculpture done by a girl named Tess Rillette,” Frey said. “Duggin liked the sculpture and he wanted to meet the girl. You introduced him to Tess and he went crazy. He worshipped her. He asked her to marry him. She thought it was funny and she told you about it. You didn’t think it was funny. You saw a new dodge — “\n\n“Now damn you —”\n\n“Quiet,” Mogin toned.\n\n“Duggin was out of his head because of Tess Rillette. And of course he bought up every piece of sculpture that Tess turned out. This sort of thing went on for more than a year, and Harry didn’t know that sculpture takes a long time and a high-class artist can turn out so many pieces and no more in a certain period. In other words, Harry didn’t stop to figure that you were selling him stuff that Tess Rillette had nothing to do with. That is — he didn’t stop to figure about it until he found out that Tess had fallen for you.”\n\n“Now you look here — “\n\n“Quiet,” Mogin toned.\n\n“Harry could be clever when he wanted to be, and he was always clever when he was good and burned up. He checked up on that stuff you sold him, found out that it was phoney. He got in touch with you, told you that you were slated for jail — but that you could snake your way out of it —  by giving up those happy little plans for yourself and Tess Rillette. By that time, you were serious about Tess and you wouldn’t give her up for anything. So you went and murdered Harry Duggin.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I said — you murdered Harry Duggin.”\n\nLasseroe stared at the lavender rug. He raised his eyes and said, “Is Harry — dead?”\n\nFrey reached in his pocket and pulled out a safety match and flicked it with his fingernail. Then he remembered he had no cigarette in his mouth and he reached out and Mogin took out a pack and gave him one.\n\nHe lit the cigarette and he said, “I’m a detective, Lasseroe. I’d like you to tell me how you did it.”\n\n“I didn’t do it.”\n\n“No?” Frey looked at Mogin. Mogin shrugged.\n\n“No, I didn’t do it,” Lasseroe said. “Let me see your badge.”\n\n“I don’t have a badge. I’m a private detective.”\n\nLasseroe said, “I’ve a good mind to call the police.”\n\n“You don’t have to call them,” Fry said. “They’ll be here soon anyway.” He walked to the door. Mogin followed.\n\nLasseroe stood there in the center of the lavender rug. He said, “You gentlemen have wasted your time.”\n\n“Quiet,” Mogin toned.\n\nIn the elevator Frey said, “Maybe we can still make that double feature.”\n\n“I’m getting hungry,” Mogin said. “How about some lunch?”\n\nFrey parted his lips and the cigarette fell from his mouth. He stepped on the stub and said, “We’ll have lunch and then we’ll visit another party.”\n\n“No double feature?” Mogin said.\n\n“No double feature. We’ll visit the third party and if we strike out we’d better leave town for a few days to avoid a lot of aggravation. See what I mean?”\n\n“I see what you mean,” Mogin said. “Who do we see now?”\n\n“We see Daisy Hennifer, the jewelry designer,” Frey said. “We go to the Vanderbilt Hotel.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Third Guess\n\nThey faked a story that they were representatives of a big Manhattan lapidary. That got them up to Daisy Hennifer’s suite. It was topaz yellow, ceiling, walls, rugs and furniture — all topaz yellow. Daisy had on a topaz yellow gown and she had topaz yellow hair.\n\n“You won’t be able to stay long, gentlemen,” she said. “I’ve a cocktail engagement at hof post threh — “\n\n“What’s that again?” Mogin said.\n\n“Skip it,” Frey said.\n\nDaisy was frowning.\n\n“What did you do last night, Miss Hennifer?” Frey said.\n\nHer topaz eyes started to glow and she said, “Just what do you mean by coming up here and — “\n\n“Don’t get excited, Miss Hennifer. We’re just doing our job, that’s all.”\n\n“But you said you were — “\n\n“No, we don’t represent a lapidary. We’re just up here to ask you a few questions, that’s all.”\n\n“You’re not police —  “ She was wearing four rings and she was twisting them about her fingers. They were all big yellow topaz stones.\n\n“Not exactly — “ Frey said.\n\n“Well then — “\n\n“Do you know Harry Duggin?” Frey said.\n\n“Why — yes. In fact, I was to see him this afternoon — “\n\n“You won’t see him, Miss Hennifer,” Frey said. “He was murdered this morning.”\n\n“Oh — “\n\n“He was a fine sort, Miss Hennifer. You shouldn’t have done it.”\n\n“Done what?”\n\n“Killed him.”\n\nShe was twisting the topaz rings. They circled fast about her long fingers, the nails of which held topaz yellow polish.\n\n“You’ve been friends with Harry for a long time, Miss Hennifer,” Frey said. “As far as you were concerned, it was more than friendship. You went for Harry. But he wasn’t serious. And he finally gave you up altogether because he was getting big ideas concerning Tess Rillette. You hated Tess. You had known her for some time and you had paid no particular attention to her, except to laugh behind her back. You looked upon her as a girl with a lot of money and no brains and no real ability as a sculptress. When you saw her at teas and parties you just saw her, that was all. But when Harry fell for her, you had to pay attention, and you hated her. You — “\n\n“How do you know this? Who are you? What — ?”\n\n“Please be quiet and listen,” Mogin droned.\n\n“It was sort of natural that you should begin to cultivate this Tess Rillette’s friendship. You wanted to talk to her about Harry. You wanted to find out just how much she cared for the guy. And then you found out that she didn’t go for him at all. She adored another man. That made you hate Harry. But at the same time you still weren’t giving up hope. You went to Harry, told him that Tess Rillette was after another man. You begged him to marry you. But instead of helping the situation, your visit made things worse. Harry began to look into the matter. He found out about Tess and this man Lasseroe. He wanted to make doubly sure. He was worried about a lot of things. He had a private investigator follow Tess around during this past week.”\n\nMogin threw a cigarette. Frey caught It and flicked a safety match with his fingernail.\n\nDaisy Hennifer was saying, “All this —  it’s — I don’t know what to think. I don’t know what to say.”\n\n“You don’t have to say anything,” Frey said. “Just write me a confession note, that’s all. Just write out the confession and sign it and you won’t have to say anything.”\n\n“But — but — “\n\n“It was convenient for you, Miss Hennifer. Lasseroe had a good motive for killing Duggin. So did Tess Rillette. At first she was indifferent to Harry. And after he threatened to have Lasseroe jailed, she hated him. But your feelings were even stronger. It was your kind of hate that turned to murder.”\n\n“You’re wrong,” she said. She was excited. “I didn’t do it.”\n\n“A confession will get you off easy.”\n\n“I’m not signing any confession,” she said. “I didn’t do it. I had nothing to do with it. I adored Harry. I — “\n\n“You’ll save yourself a lot of misery —” She started to sob. “I didn’t do it. I — “\n\nFrey looked at Mogin. The short, heavy guy shrugged.\n\n“Is that all, Miss Hennifer?” Frey asked. “That’s all I’ve got to say.”\n\nShe stopped sobbing. Her topaz eyes were dull now.\n\n“Are you going to take me away?”\n\nFrey shook his head. “We can’t take you away. We’re not cops.”\n\nShe stared. “Then — what are you?”\n\nFrey shrugged. “Maybe were just a couple of damn fools.”\n\nHe nodded to Mogin. They went out of Daisy Hennifer’s suite.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nBack to Tess Rillette’s\n\nThey were walking toward the coupe. Mogin was saying, “It’s almost three.”\n\n“We’ll have something to eat and we’ll go back and sit in the coupe and wait a while,” Frey said. He put his hand in his change pocket and took out two half dollars, three quarters, six dimes, four nickels. “We’ll eat a classy lunch on this,” he said. “Then we’ll wait around for a little while and we’ll see where Daisy Hennifer goes.”\n\n“It’s all right with me,” Mogin said: “Anything’s all right with me — as long as we eat.”\n\nThey lunched at the hotel and then they walked out to the lobby and sat down and smoked. At twenty past three, Daisy Hennifer walked through the lobby and Frey and Mogin took their time and followed her.\n\nA cab was waiting at the curb and Daisy got in.\n\nThe coupe followed.\n\nUp Fourth avenue and two turns to blade through heavy uptown traffic and then down the street where Tess Rillette lived. The cab stopped outside the white stone house and Daisy got out.\n\nThe coupe went once around the block and then Frey parked it at the corner.\n\n“This looks good,” he said.\n\nMogin nodded.\n\nFrey said, “Maybe you better wait here. If I’m not out in thirty minutes maybe you better come in and see what’s happened to me.”\n\nMogin said, “Maybe you better take this.”\n\nHe reached in his coat pocket and pulled out a little pistol. Frey looked at it and made a face.\n\n“I hate to use those things.”\n\nHe took the pistol and put it in his pocket and walked up the white stone steps. The Jap came to the door and Frey said,\n\n“Well — it’s past three thirty. Miss Rillette is expecting me, isn’t she — ?”\n\nThe Jap shook his head. “Miss Rillette is busy. You must call later.”\n\n“Tell Miss Rillette that I — “\n\nHe braked his tongue and said, “No — don’t tell Miss Rillette anything. “In fact — maybe you better take a walk around the block.”\n\nThe Jap started to get excited. He said, “You were not among those invited — “\n\n“Take a walk around the block,” Frey said. “Look, I’ll help you down the steps — “ He grabbed hold of the Jap and hustled him down the steps. Mogin saw the deal and opened the door of the coupe. Frey pushed the Jap inside.\n\n“What’s this?” Mogin said.\n\n“A glimpse of the Far East,” Frey murmured. “Take him to a show. Take him to a dance. I don’t care what you do with him, only keep him away from the house for a while. He’ll get in my way otherwise.”\n\nThe Jap started to yell.\n\n“Tag him,” Frey said. He looked up and down the street and he saw that it was all right. Then he heard a click and he saw Mogin s fist bouncing away from the Jap’s chin. The Jap went to sleep.\n\n“I’ll drive around the block a few times,” Mogin said.\n\nFrey went up the steps again and took his time going through the pale orange room, the burnt orange room. Then he was moving slowly and very quietly as he heard voices coming from the other pale orange room. The orange door was closed but Frey managed to get in a look through the side windows of the studio. The windows were slits of glass running from the floor to the ceiling, and through them Frey saw Tess Rillette and Lasseroe and Daisy Hennifer.\n\nThey were all talking at once and at first their voices were low but then they started to argue and Frey got in on it.\n\n“Clever, weren’t you, Daisy?” Tess Rillette was saying. “You asked me to be your guest at the hotel, and I thought it was hospitality. But what you really wanted was to keep me away from here. You didn’t want Harry to get in touch with me.”\n\n“That’s a lie,” Daisy said. “I asked you to stay at the hotel purely for business reasons. I wanted you to work on those inlaid ivories — “\n\n“That’s what I thought — at first,” Tess Rillette said. “But I know the truth now. You wanted to keep me away from Harry. You thought maybe you had one last chance of winning him back. And when you found out it was futile — you killed him!”\n\n“She’s right, Daisy,” Lasseroe said. “You killed Harry Duggin. You worshipped him  — and hated him!”\n\nHe got out of the chair and pointed at her, and a few glasses on a cocktail tray tipped over.\n\nDaisy was shouting, “You’re both lying! You’re trying to place the blame on me and switch things around so that I’ll be put out of the way. You’re trying to commit —  double murder!”\n\n“Just what do you mean by that?” Lasseroe said.\n\nDaisy’s voice was lowered as she stared at the art appraiser and said, “You killed him. You had every reason to kill him, and you did it. And now you’re trying to get me out of the way. I know the truth about you, Lasseroe. I know how you’ve been swindling art patrons, charging them exorbitant prices for cheap junk such as Tess puts out — “\n\nTess Rillette wasn’t taking this sitting down. She started to call Daisy a lot of nasty names. It was all very unpleasant.\n\nAnd then Lasseroe said, “You’ve got a lot of influence around this town, haven’t you, Daisy?”\n\nShe liked that. She nodded. And there was a mean smile on her lips. Lasseroe was moving slowly toward her, and his face was pale. There was a light in the man’s eyes that told Frey a lot of things. Frey reached into his coat pocket and touched the revolver to make sure that it was still there.\n\n“You’ve got a lot of mouth, too,” Lasseroe was saying.\n\n“Just what do you mean by that?” Daisy looked at him straight.\n\n“You may turn out to be quite an annoyance,” Lasseroe said. He kept moving toward her.\n\nTess Rillette was grabbing Lasseroe arm, saying, “Please — enough has already happened — “\n\nBut Lasseroe was excited and he was pushing Tess Rillette away and then he was making a grab for Daisy. She fell backward and he went over with her and he got his fingers around her throat. She managed to scream once and then she started to gurgle. Frey opened the door and took out his revolver and pointed it at Lasseroe’s spine.\n\n“All right,” he said, “Let’s stop playing.”\n\nBut Lasseroe was out of control now and he was choking the life out of Daisy Hennifer. He didn’t seem to hear Frey, and he increased the pressure of his fingers around Daisy’s windpipe. Tess Rillette was screaming and putting herself between Frey and Lasseroe, in an ungraceful try at the old martyr act.\n\nFrey knew that he couldn’t stand on ceremony. He had to break it up and break it up fast. He pushed Tess Rillette and she didn’t like being pushed. She was screaming now, and she threw fingernails at his face. He let her have a slow right to the jaw and it sent her across the room, spinning.\n\nThen he had a try at Lasseroe.\n\nHe tried to pull Lasseroe away from Daisy Hennifer, who by now was in a very bad way. But Lasseroe was a maniac now and he wanted to take the life away from the jewelry designer. Frey knew that he would have to use the revolver. He lifted it and then allowed the butt to come down and make contact with Lassereo’s skull.\n\nLasseroe went to sleep.\n\n“We’ll take them all down to Harry’s apartment,” Frey said. “If the cops aren’t there already, it’ll be a good idea to finish the case right on the spot where it started.”\n\n“That’s a very good idea,” Mogin said. “I have a hunch that this will put us on the map.”\n\nFrey nodded. He prodded Lasseroe with the revolver and said, “You and Miss Rillette will sit in the opera seats with me. Miss Hennifer will ride in front.” He touched the shivering Jap on the elbow and said, “The studio is in quite a bad state. Better go in there and rearrange things. If you have any questions to ask Miss Rillette, maybe you better call the police station. That’ll be her temporary address before she goes away on a long trip.”\n\nHe stepped into the coupe and closed the door. Lasseroe was manacled to him and Miss Rillette was manacled to Lasseroe. Daisy was still groaning as Mogin put the car in first and sent it whizzing down the street.\n\n“You’re making a big mistake,” Lasseroe said.\n\n“I wouldn’t talk about making mistakes if I were you,” Frey said lightly. He felt very good. All a private investigator needed was one good break like this, and he was made. The cases would come in thick and fast, and so would the dough. Frey smiled.\n\nTess Rillette was saying, “I told you, Mr. Frey — you were letting yourself in for a lot of difficulty, and — ‘’\n\n“Do I turn here?” Mogin was saying.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nIt’s the Harry Duggin Case\n\nThere were a few police cars in front of the high-class apartment where Harry Duggin had lived, and where he had died. The coupe parked across the street and Frey saw the crowd and the reporters. He said, “All right — here we go.”\n\nEveryone was looking and murmuring as the five of them went into the apartment house. A cop walked over and said, “What’s this?”\n\n“It’s the Harry Duggin case,” Frey said. They stepped into the elevator and went up seven floors to the apartment. There were a lot of cops up there, a lot of plain clothes men and lads from the homicide bureau. Reporters and photographers and a doctor.\n\n“What’s this?” a plain clothes man said.\n\n“It’s the Harry Duggin case,” Frey said.\n\nThe mob crowded around. This little deal was taking place in the living room of the apartment.\n\nThe dick was saying, “Carven is in the bedroom. He’s talking to Duggin’s valet.”\n\nHe frowned at Frey and said, “What have you got?”\n\n“Enough,” Frey said. He pointed to Lasseroe. “Here’s your baby. I’m going in and talk to Carven.”\n\nAs he started for the bedroom door he heard Lasseroe saying, “You’re making a big mistake — “\n\nFrey smiled.\n\nHe went into the bedroom and he saw Carven, the big shot detective. He saw the two cops in there and he saw the valet, and then the corpse of Harry Duggin. Carven had the valet by the back of the neck. Carven was a big man and he was forcing the valet to look down at Harry Duggin’s dead face.\n\nCarven was saying, “Look at him. He’s dead. Do you get that? He’s dead. You called us in here and you figured that would automatically put you out of the picture. And you told us that a guy by the name of Frey came in here this morning and killed him. But Frey’s an old pal of mine. Frey’s a private dick — a lousy one, reckless and careless, but still he’s a dick and your story didn’t go. You killed Duggin — why —  why — ?”\n\nNot only was Carven big, he was plenty tough. He gave the valet a short left and a mean right to the ribs. The valet broke.\n\n“I — I killed him,” he said, and it turned into a sob. “I — I wanted something that he owned — “\n\n“What was it?” Carven said. He raised his head, clipped to one of the cops, “Take this down.”\n\nThe valet was sobbing, saying, “He had a fortune in little marble statues. He was always talking about those marble statues, telling me how priceless they were. He —  kept talking about those statues all the time, telling me that the greatest sculptress in the world made them — and that money couldn’t buy them. That’s all he talked about — the statues made by Tess Rillette. He — drove it into me — made me crazy with the desire to own them. I — I — put a knife into him — “\n\nCarven grinned. He looked at the cops and said, “Pretty fast, wasn’t it? We came in on this case exactly two and a half hours ago. I can well imagine what happened to that wise guy Frey. He came in here this morning and he saw Duggin lying dead in bed and he figured he’d go out with his stooge Mogin and do big things. I’d like to see his face when he finds out — “\n\nThen he turned and saw Frey’s face.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA Late Double Feature\n\nMogin was talking loud and fast.\n\nHe was saying, “What’re you crying the blues about? It was just a bad break, that’s all. And at least we pinned something on somebody. We got that smart bird Lasseroe locked up for fake art manipulations, and — “\n\nThey were walking toward the coupe. Frey was shaking his head and his head was hanging low. He said, “Can we make a late double feature?”\n\n“Sure,” Mogin said. He put his heavy hand on Frey’s shoulder and said, “It’s a good idea. We’ll go to the movies and get it off our minds. Don’t worry, pal. Better days are coming. Hey — where you goin’?”\n\nFrey was walking away from the coupe, toward a corner drug store.\n\n“I’ll be right back,” be said. “I just want to go in here and take an aspirin. It’ll help me wait for the better days,”\n\n~ The End ~\n"

Austin Bowen, rector of the old-world village of Cranleigh, “that Ulric s ghost should suddenly start haunting the abbey after you’d publicised him in your book?”\n\nBowen also smiled.\n\n“It’s wonderful what the power of suggestion will do, old man,” he said.\n\nHe pointed to the open book, “The History of Cranleigh Abbey,” which lay on the table at the visitor’s side.\n\n“I drew on my imagination a bit for that chapter about Ulric,” he confessed, “and it inspired the reviewers. Since when four trippers have been scared out of their wits by a shadowy figure they think they saw within the ruins.\n\n” It’s been good for trade, though,” he added, his smile broadening as he pointed through the leaded drawing room window at the gaunt figure of a grey-haired, bushy-browed man who was carrying a coil of hosepipe across the perfectly-kept lawn.\n\n“Ask old Carter. I allow him to charge visitors threepence a time for his services as guide, on condition that he hands over fifty per cent, to the Abbey Church Restoration Fund, and twenty-five per cent, to the Old People’s Relief Fund.”\n\nHawke, whose visit to Cranleigh had been prompted partly by curiosity concerning the ghost of Brother Ulric, and partly by a desire to renew an old acquaintanceship, gazed abstractedly through the window for a moment.\n\n“You must come and meet Carter,” said Bowen. “He is that curious institution of village life known as the local character.”\n\nTogether they strolled out to the grounds of the rectory.\n\nAway to their right, as they crossed the lawn, some thirty people, in straggling file, were labouring up the gravelled path towards the creeper- covered abbey ruins, and parked near the ancient stone parapet by the river were two yellow motor-coaches and a number of cycles, motor-cycles and cars.\n\n“Carter will be pitching them a fine tale presently,” chuckled Bowen. “What he doesn’t know about the abbey he invents. The old rascal tells them he knows where Ulric’s treasure is hidden, but intends to let it stay lest he be stricken low by the unknown.”\n\nA few moments later Bowen was effecting a one-sided introduction, in which the formality of handshaking was waived.\n\n“Friend of mine, David,” he said, indicating Hawke with a sweep of his arm. “He wants to know if you’ve seen Ulric’s ghost.”\n\n“Perhaps,” was the grim reply, “but you know I never speak of such things.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nWhat the Rector Saw\n\nFrom Bowen’s frivolous demeanour and David Carter’s exaggerated show of attention to his words, Hawke gathered that there was something a little queer about the man.\n\nJust how queer Hawke was to learn in the rectory library about an hour later, after Carter had seen the touring party off.\n\nHe brought in a pocketful of coppers, which the rector counted out and divided into three piles, one of which he returned to the man.\n\n“Oh, David,” called the rector as Carter was about to leave. “I rather prize that book-end you’ve just put in your pocket. I’ll have it back, if you don’t mind.”\n\nWithout any show of embarrassment Carter produced a carved book-end from his voluminous jacket-pocket and put it down on the table.\n\n“An accident,” he said evenly.\n\n“Quite,” answered Bowen.\n\nHawke stared at the rector in surprise after Carter had gone.\n\n“Kleptomania,” explained Bowen. “The funny thing is he can be completely trusted with money. He steals odds and ends, irrespective of their value.”\n\n“And is this trait of his generally known in the village?”\n\nBowen nodded.\n\n“They invariably search him before he leaves the village inn, having missed numerous tankards, ashtrays, and so on, and he is actually credited with having got away with the village policeman’s handcuffs.”\n\n“What exactly,” asked Hawke with a grin, “is his function in life?”\n\n“Organ-blower, sexton, and general handyman.”\n\nHawke frowned thoughtfully at the carpet.\n\n“He sounded to me,” murmured the detective presently, “as though he might really believe in this legend about Ulric’s ghost. Or is he simply trying to create an impression?”\n\nIt was the rector’s turn to frown.\n\n“I’ve been trying for some time to settle that point, but without success. The village is content to label him ‘Daft David,’ and leave it at that, but I — I’m not so sure. He’s capable of astonishing depth of thought at times.”\n\nHawke stared at his old friend.\n\n“What’s going on at the back of your mind, Bowen?”\n\nThe rector coloured slightly, and then coughed.\n\n“Well,” he said, “I suppose this is where you get a good hearty laugh at my expense. I — I’ve seen the ghost myself.”\n\n“Tell me about it,” said Hawke. Bowen looked momentarily uncomfortable.\n\n“It’s a story I’m not particularly proud of,” he stated. “You sec, I ran away from the blessed thing. My only excuse is that, I was just recovering from a bout of flu, and my nerves were all to pieces.”\n\n“What, for goodness sake,” asked Hawke, “was it like?”\n\nHe was surveying Bowen with a kind of dumbfounded curiosity, for the clergyman was decidedly not the type to let his imagination run away with him.\n\n“It — it was like nothing in particular. Something disturbed me during the night. A noise of some kind from just below my window. I looked out and saw nothing at first, except the odd shapes of the broken stone walls of the abbey in the moonlight. Then I saw something move. It was almost the same colour as the background. A kind of light beige colour, similar to that of the Cistercians’ garb.\n\n“The thing was about man size,” went on the rector, “but shapeless, except — “\n\n“Yes,” encouraged Hawke, “except what?”\n\n“Except that it gave me the impression of raising one of its draped arms and beckoning to me.”\n\nHawke inclined his head in the direction of Bowen’s book.\n\n“In accordance with the tradition?”\n\n“Well, there is a story to the effect that Ulric beckons his victims on towards his treasure hoard, and that they are afterwards found lying horribly strangled.”\n\n“Well, what happened?”\n\n“I was as bold as could be while I was indoors, and I swaggered out to investigate. I crossed the kitchen garden, which has no fence, and walked across the strip of ground in front of the cloister walls.\n\n“The thing had retreated, and was standing, quite still, against one of the walls. I continued to walk towards it, and it continued to remain perfectly still. I involuntarily slowed my pace, and then I stopped.\n\n“There it was, just a weird, shapeless apparition, waiting. That was what broke my nerve. The suggestion that it was waiting, d’you understand? Just waiting. I turned and sprinted back indoors, and spent a busy night fighting down my shame by telling myself that it was the aftermath of my ‘flu. I took another look out of the window before getting into bed, but the thing had gone.”\n\n“Probably it was all due to the ‘flu,” ventured Hawke. “Your fancy is apt to play tricks with you when you’re recovering from an illness.”\n\nBowen agreed, but with no great show of conviction.\n\n“Don’t forget,” he said, “that four visitors claim to have had the same experience.”\n\n“Yes, but after the publication of your book. You yourself hinted at the power of suggestion.”\n\nBowen conceded the point.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Sexton’s Story\n\nThe following afternoon Hawke and his young assistant, Tommy Burke, accompanied a party of visitors, whom Carter showed over the ruins.\n\nCarter surveyed them all with a kind of fierce dignity as he told them that he knew where the treasure hoard was.\n\nHe was proof against such badinage as that levelled at him by a London member of the party.\n\n“Why don’t ye dig it aht, chum? I pay the best prices for old gold an’ joolry.”\n\n“It stays where it is,” declared Carter solemnly, “and I’m not telling.”\n\nHe then went on to relate, with showmanlike declamation, how Ulric’s ghost was sometimes to be seen standing guard over his plunder, and woe betide any who approached within reach of the apparition.\n\nHawke took him to task after the party had gone, but the sexton stuck to his story.\n\n“I’m not telling lies,” he protested. “There is a treasure hoard, and I know where it is. D’you think I’d deceive these visitors? That would be obtaining money by false pretences.”\n\n“And have you seen the ghost?” Carter hesitated.\n\n“I’ll say nothing about that,” he declared with finality.\n\nHawke later repeated the conversation to Bowen, who said:\n\n“As I told you, David’s scrupulously honest over money. He’d scorn to gain any by deceit. Though I can’t quite understand his insistence on that story about the treasure.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nTommy Gets a Fright\n\nTwo nights later events took a sudden, startling turn.\n\nIt was one of those glittering moonlit nights, the landscape being thrown into sharp, purple shadowed relief.\n\nHawke had retired to bed at about eleven, and was aroused from his slumbers a little over an hour later.\n\nDrowsily he realised that the cause of the disturbance was the rattling of his bedroom door handle, and he got out of bed and unlocked the door.\n\nIt was thrust open, and he was almost pushed back into a sitting position on the edge of his bed by Tommy Burke.\n\nThe youth was half-dressed, without jacket or waistcoat, and his feet were encased in bedroom slippers.\n\nHis physical appearance gave Hawke a shock.\n\nGone was the normal ruddy complexion, and the shaft of moonlight which streamed in through the window showed a chalk-white face under a ruffled mop of hair.\n\nThere were two long scratches across the young man’s forehead, and a thin, vivid trickle of blood ran down his right cheek.\n\nHis breathing was laboured in the extreme, and his first attempts at speech were abortive gulpings.\n\n“What’s happened? Here, take it easy, son. Sit down and get your wind before you start talking.”\n\n“I — I’m all right, guv’nor, only — bit of a shock, that’s all.”\n\n“Yes? What kind of a shock?”\n\nTommy then proceeded to relate a story almost identical with Bowen’s, except that it went further and had a remarkable conclusion.\n\n“It sounds silly, sir, but d’you think there can be such things — I mean, I seem to have read somewhere of spirits that cannot make themselves visible, but have the power to inhabit clothing  — and make themselves visible that way.”\n\n“I have heard such stories but never treated them seriously, of course.”\n\n“No. Quite.”\n\nTommy gulped once more, and then, seeming to get a grip on himself, proceeded:\n\n“It was out in the kitchen garden when I first looked through the window, but when I got outside it had retreated to that bit of wall near the old cloisters.\n\n“When I got within ten yards of it I felt my back hair creep. The thing was about your height, and sort of bulky at the top. It was the same colour all over  — a kind of light brown — and the face, if there was any face, was entirely hooded.\n\n“I wanted to bolt, but I didn’t dare turn my back on the thing, guv’nor. I had the feeling that it would catch up with me in a flash.\n\n“After standing still for a second, I took a pace backwards, and it — it — “\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“I didn’t get any farther away from it, because it took a pace forward.”\n\nTommy paused to dab his brow with his handkerchief.\n\n“So,” he continued, “I went forward again, simply because — because I found it impossible to do anything else. I got about as close to it as I am to you, guv’nor, and then — gosh!”\n\nTommy gulped once more.\n\n“It suddenly pounced on me, guv’nor. I shall never forget it as long as I live. It didn’t make a solid impact, but all the same I rolled on the ground under it, kicking and struggling like mad with it.\n\n“As soon as I’d recovered some of my wits,” concluded the youth, “I realised that I wasn’t struggling with anything at all. It was just — cloth. There was nothing else there.”\n\n“What kind of cloth?” asked the astonished detective.\n\n“It was the dust sheet off Mr. Bowen’s car. I’ve put it back.”\n\nThe two stared at one another while the seconds ticked by.\n\n“So you think,” said Hawke at length, “that the sheet was pulled off the car by some supernatural agency and temporarily — inhabited?”\n\nHawke strolled to the window and stood looking out towards the abbey ruins for a moment. Then he suddenly peeled off his pyjama jacket and reached into the wardrobe for his clothes.\n\n“I’ll go and have a look round.”\n\n“I’ll come with you, guv’nor. It’ll help to restore my nerve.”\n\nThe two were presently strolling through the ruins, gazing keenly about them.\n\nTommy, pointed out the spot where the apparition had stood, and signs of a scuffle on the hard, gravelly ground bore testimony to the accuracy of his story.\n\nHawke idly picked up a short broken pine branch which lay on the ground, and stood moodily beating his log with it as he stared at the marks.\n\nHe then wandered round to the other side of the wall, which was in shadow, and again examined the stony ground, this time by the light of his pocket torch.\n\nHe stooped and picked up what Tommy at first took to be small, white stones, but which proved, on closer examination, to be pieces of broken porcelain, one of the fragments of which was perforated.\n\n“What is it, sir?”\n\n“I don’t know. Piece of a china ornament or something that somebody has trodden on.”\n\nHe continued his inspection of the ground, and proceeded eventually to the shed where the rector kept his car, and where Hawke’s car was also parked.\n\nIt is a rare thing for cars to be stolen from remote places like Cronleigh, and the rector seemed sufficiently conscious of this fact to dispense with shed doors. A light brown sheet protected his car from dust.\n\nHawke and Tommy related their adventures at breakfast next morning, and Bowen was excited and quite patently relieved that someone else besides himself should have encountered the apparition.\n\n“I knew it. I knew it,” he said. “There’s something queer about the atmosphere of this place. I’ve felt it. Dash ! Look, I’ve ruined my kidneys and bacon. Mary, why on earth must you leave the lid off this pepper-pot?”\n\nHe had tipped a heap of pepper on to his breakfast dish, which the apologetic maid hastened to replace, amid protests that she had not touched the pepper-pot.\n\n“Tommy,” said Hawke suddenly, “did you say that apparition bulged out at the top and was thin at the foot?”\n\n“That’s right, sir. Why?”\n\nHawke smiled faintly.\n\n“I’ll be on the look-out for it,” he said.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nUlric’s “Treasure”\n\nThe story of Tommy’s experience spread as only small villages can spread such things, and two newspaper reporters called during the day.\n\nThe resultant publicity brought a new and bigger influx of curious sightseers, and Carter reaped a rich harvest for himself and the church funds.\n\nHawke, having perambulated about the abbey on four successive nights without result, was due to return to London, and was almost in despair of clearing up the mystery.\n\nOn the fifth night, the last of his stay at Cranleigh, he quietly left the rectory shortly after everyone had retired, and commenced his usual patrol of the grounds.\n\nHe was passing by the shed where the cars were kept when he noticed something that aroused his interest.\n\nThe dust sheet was missing from the rector’s car.\n\nAs on the night of Tommy’s adventure, a brilliant moon was shining from a cloudless sky, and a very faint, almost imperceptible breeze rustled the ivy leaves on the abbey walls.\n\nHawke stepped cautiously round the end of the rectory, and then, a few seconds later, his attention was attracted by a slight movement.\n\nThere was the shrouded figure against the cloister wall, exactly as Tommy had described it.\n\nHawke walked steadily towards it and then affected to hesitate, exactly as Tommy had done, whereupon the shape seemed to quiver slightly, and to thrust itself a little forward.\n\nThe detective continued his advance for a few paces, and then made a movement which, to an onlooker, must have been as unexpected as it was swift.\n\nHe ran at a low part of the wall a few feet to one side of the “apparition,” and vaulted it nimbly.\n\nPlunging into the deep shadow on the other side of the wall, he encountered something a little more solid than Tommy had done. There was clothing, and inside the clothing was a creature of flesh and blood.\n\nA pair of strong hands closed round the detective’s neck, and in a second he was hitting out in a desperate struggle with an adversary who was possessed of considerable strength.\n\nHe rolled over, and his opponent rolled on top of him. The grip on his throat tightened, but a sharp, left-arm jab which caught the other a painful crack on the elbow joint caused the grip to loosen.\n\nAn instant later Hawke got in a telling right to the jaw, and freed himself of the clawing, horny hands.\n\nHe had mastery of the situation when he heard the sound of running feet on the other side of the wall.\n\nTommy and the rector came on the scene, and helped Hawke to drag his captive out into the moonlight.\n\n“David !” exclaimed Bowen.\n\n“Yes,” Hawke said. “It’s Mr. Carter. The gentleman who took the porcelain top off your pepper-pot.”\n\n“David, you fool, what have you been playing at?”\n\nHawke stepped forward and picked up a broken pine branch, similar to the one he had previously found.\n\n“He had the dust sheet draped over this,” he said, “and stood behind the wall, peeping over the top as his victim approached. D’you realise,” he snapped, turning on the shamefaced sexton, “that you might have caused somebody’s death by fright?”\n\nCarter, in a whimpering tone, admitted that he hadn’t thought of that aspect of it.\n\n“Practical joking at your age, David!” chided the rector.\n\n“It wasn’t practical joking,” interrupted the man. “I wanted to draw the visitors.”\n\n“You certainly did that all right,” said Hawke, “but I thought you told me you were above deceiving them. When I questioned you about that plunder hoard story of yours —”\n\n“There is a plunder hoard. There had to be a plunder hoard.”\n\nA few moments later Carter had pulled aside a few bricks from the base of the wall, and there, before the astonished eyes of the onlookers, was the plunder.\n\nIt is a matter of eternal speculation with Hawke and Tommy as to exactly how far Carter was rational and how far he was mad. Where exactly did reason leave off and idiocy begin ruling the man’s actions? He stuck to his peculiar idea of honesty all the way, and there was undeniable logic in all his actions.\n\nThere had to be a plunder hoard, and there was a plunder hoard.\n\nIt consisted of such widely varied things as tankards and ashtrays stolen from the village inn; spoons, the works of an alarm clock, a door-knocker, and —  the village policeman’s handcuffs!\n\n~THE END~\n"

      "content_html": "One of the earliest cipher methods is recorded by Herodotus, was shaved, and the message tattooed on his scalp. After his hair had grown, he was sent on his way. When he reached his destination his head was again shaved, and the message read.\n\nThis article must be in part a taking of time-out to offer something besides thanks to the many who have sent in messages to be deciphered. The thanks are there, and deeply expressed; but with them there must go a word of criticism, to wit: several messages which entirely defied my best efforts proved, on consulting the enclosed key, to be undecipherable even with the full directions in view!\n\nI have in mind particularly one most tantalizing array of figures: it ran something like this: 3158742785183775492, etc. It contained a prime number of figures, so that it could not be broken up into groups for possible addition; there seemed to be no recurrences, though there were a few promising-looking doubles. Now logic will show that it is impossible to make a substitution alphabet using single figures for letters, as there are only 9 figures — or 10, if you count zero — whereas there are 26 letters.\n\nOne of the elemental laws of cryptogram-deciphering is that when one finds a message composed wholly of figures those figures must be in combination, in some way or other.\n\nWell, in this particular message, in despair I opened the sealed key, and found that the contributor had made two circles of cardboard, each divided into 9 parts and turning on a common center. In the inner circle were written the numbers from 1 to 9, in scrambled order; in the outer was the alphabet, in nine groups of three letters each, except one, which contained only two letters. To code, the inner circle was placed in one position, and the required letter was given the number that happened to come under it; then the outer circle was moved clockwise one space, and the second letter coded by its figure; and so on.\n\nThe worst of it was that even with the key and full directions it was impossible to decode the message!\n\nThe first figure was 2; it was under the division containing the letters DEF. How could I — or anyone else  — know which of the three letters was the right one? The second figure was 7, and fell under PQR; what help was there? One might guess that R, as a common letter, was the second letter of the message; but a word could begin with DR, ER, or FR; moreover EQ could have been a perfect beginning — EQUAL, for instance; and the farther one went, the more tangled the whole thing would be. So let me stress a point once more:\n\nA code to be of any use at all must be practical.\n\nNothing would be more easy than to compose a code which I could not decipher; in fact, there are plenty of straight codes which I should hate to tackle without unlimited time at my disposal; but there is always the danger that in being extremely secretive the composer will be so secretive that he will fool everyone, including the recipient of his message. Obviously a method of secret communication must be open to the holder of the key, or it becomes useless.\n\nThis is, of course, the basis for the original claim that what one man can invent another can decipher. It is presupposed that with the key the message can be read; the job of the decipherer is to find the key.\n\nHaving pushed which out of our system, let us return to more practical matters.\n\nEnough, it seems to us, has not been made of the so-called “Dictionary” ciphers, or “Book” ciphers. This is a very simple method, easily disguised and difficult of decipherment. The method of coding is easy: a book — usually a small dictionary — is agreed upon between the parties; the message is coded by taking words — not letters — from the book and sending a series of numbers to indicate the page and the location of the word on the page. In the case of a dictionary, in which the words would be arranged in columns, three numbers usually represent the words — page, column, and position in the column. The small pocket dictionaries, which contain from fifty to a hundred thousand words, are excellent for this purpose.\n\nI have, let us say, such a dictionary, containing 400 pages. I wish to send the message “If you will meet me at one o’clock I will tell you everything.” I search for the word “If,” and find it to be the fifth word from the top in the second column on page 147. I write 5-2-147, and proceed to “You.” This is the eighth in the first column on page 397, and is coded 8-1-397. “Will” occurs as 11-2-306, “Meet” as 16-1-201, “Me” as 22-2-200, “at” as 11-2-16, and so on. These are actual codings, by the way, from a real book. The message is sent like this:\n\n52147 81397 112306 161201 222200 112016, etc., etc.\n\nNote that in the last number the page  — 16–was given a zero in front of it. This was so that the recipient of the message would not imagine, as he might, that the word was the first word in the first column on page 216, as it would seem if written 11216. The receiver takes the last three figures of each number, which gives him the page; the next figure is the column, and the first figure or figures the word itself.\n\nHow can such a message be decoded?\n\nThere are several tables which give the proportion of words in dictionaries according to their initials; the alphabet itself is a fairly good guide. Thus M is the middle letter of the alphabet, and M falls nearly in the middle of any dictionary. A is, of course, at the beginning, and Z at the end; the other letters fall pretty much where you would suppose. If you open a dictionary three-quarters of the way from the beginning you will land in the S’s, almost certainly.\n\nIt is unlikely that a dictionary used for coding will have pages numbered in more than three figures. A book of over 1,000 pages would be bulky to handle and would contain far too many useless words. Assuming that the dictionary is small, the first task of the decoder is to try to find the numbers which represent the pages. Remember that in a message of any length the same words are certain to crop up — AND, OF, WITH, etc. We omit THE because it is probable that such a message would omit this word, as is done in telegraphing. If, however, the decoder found several numbers which were very small he would be justified in assuming that these represented words beginning with A; and if the same numbers were repeated it would be a sure sign that they stood for common A-words like AND, AT, AM, ARE. Repeated words with very large numbers would be near the end of the dictionary — probably YOU or YOUR. Note in our own message, also, the consecutive page-numbers 201-200. In a 400-page book these would be about the middle — M-words — and the fact that they were so close together would suggest some such combination as MEET ME.\n\nWe are aware that this sounds like rank guesswork; and we admit at once that the solving of Dictionary ciphers involves the least straight reasoning and the most assumption. There are ways of scrambling the numbers, too — for instance, the first two and the last figure might represent the page, the second one or two the number of the word, and the remaining figure the column. To code Word 14, column 2, page 363, we would write 36-14-2-3, only of course the hyphens would be omitted–361423. Not an easy task for a would-be decoder!\n\nThe difficulty with dictionary codes is the likelihood of getting the figures so scrambled that the receiver, even with the key, may be led astray. He might even confuse BUY with SELL, which could be highly disastrous. In the effort to insure understandability certain give-aways are likely to crop up; for instance, few small dictionaries have more than two columns to the page; the decoder, noticing that 1 or 2 is always in the same place in each number, receives a strong hint. Even if the columns are not indicated there is bound to be a series of numbers running regularly from small to large, which will furnish a clue.\n\nAndre Langie, the French cryptographer, tells of deciphering a dictionary-coded message from which he obtained the meaning “Either X or Y warmly recommended.” The actual meaning of the message, it developed, was “Both X and Y absolutely unknown!” The numbers had been skilfully scrambled so as to lead the solver far astray. This, however, could hardly be done in a message of any length.\n\nWe recommend dictionary codes to our readers as simple and certain, as well as difficult to decipher.\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "Chapter 1\n\nHenry’s\n\nFrom pretty laughing girls to sumptuous places of amusement, there are many attractions at Palermo Beach. It is a place of sunshine by day and semitropic loveliness by night. It is a resort for the idle rich, who go there especially to employ themselves very busily killing time. Not being able to spend as much money as they want to on legitimate extravagancies, the very wealthy get rid of their surplus evening hours and throw away a good deal of their money at Henry’s.\n\nEverybody who is somebody knows Henry’s, but neither he nor his house is supposed to exist. Henry’s is there, but not officially. Henry is a fat and smiling agent of the Goddess of Chance. He keeps, in magnificent style and with due regard to secrecy, a gambling house. Henry’s is a miniature Monte Carlo, but there is nothing small about the money that goes into the pockets of Henry. There is no limit to his capacity for absorbing all the cash his patrons care to throw away.\n\nIn order to get into Henry’s one must be of the very elect, or sponsored by some one who will vouch for the visitors discretion and ability to lose money without making a fuss. Yet, there are occasions when the crowd at Henry’s includes a number of guests who keep the outwardly suave and bland Henry in a condition of nervous apprehension. Henry would rather lose a few hundred than have some transient gambler go broke and perhaps give the place a bad name by throwing away his life as well as his money.\n\nIt was this dread of having an unwelcome publicity thrust upon himself and his ornate temple of luck that caused Henry to listen with intent gravity when one of his immaculately attired aids came into his private room and reported that a newcomer had just enriched the roulette table by seven thousand dollars. It was no unusual thing for a regular patron to go away from Henry’s the poorer by fifteen or twenty thousand dollars. On these occasions Henry would chuckle over his gains, but strangers he was afraid of.\n\n“Hows he taking it?” he inquired anxiously.\n\nThe gentleman in the tuxedo shrugged his shoulders. “He seems to be quiet enough, but you never can tell. It may be a case of still waters run deep, you know. Better have a look at him.”\n\nHenry followed his watcher into the pillared hall. Grouped at the various tables, as orderly and impassive as if they were in their own offices, were scores of men who could buy and lose costly chips as freely as the average person spends cigarette money. These were the men Henry liked to have around. They could afford to lose.\n\n“Wheres that fellow? Who brought him here?” asked Henry as his glance roved about the gaming crowd.\n\n“He came with the Matidell party. A guest of theirs, no doubt, and of course there was no stopping him from coming in. Old Mandell will go right up in the air if we so much as look twice at any one he brings along. Theres the chap right now. Coming toward us. Going home, I guess.”\n\n“All right, leave it to me,” grunted Henry, and, under lowered brows he took stock of the man who had just dropped seven thousand.\n\nAs was very natural, Henry was a fair judge of character, a reader of expressions, and he seldom ever forgot a face. At a quick pace the man came toward him, and Henry had very hastily to make up his mind what he was going to do. With all his faculties of observation keyed up to the utmost, he strove to make certain what was passing through this losers mind.\n\nWas he despondent? Was one of those weak-minded fools who step over the border when, through their own fault, destiny hands them misfortune? Should he stop the man and play the generous and return him part or all of his losings?\n\nHenry’s face grew grim at this thought. He was not one to part with any of his gains if he could possibly help it. Yet, he knew full well it would pay him far better to make some compromise than to have talk and gossip of a suicide drawing attention to his gaming house. That was not good advertising and not conducive to the retention of the patronage he now enjoyed. Still, unable to read the mans face with certainty, Henry hesitated. His greediness to hold what he had, pulled him toward the opinion that he was safe in letting the man go. While he balanced between safety first and taking a chance, another guest joined the man he was watching and the two passed out of the house.\n\n“That settles it,” thought Henry. “Hes gone and there’s no good worrying about the matter.”\n\nSo it was that Henry, clever man of his world, killed his doubts with a reasoning which fitted his desires.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Hysterical Woman\n\nAmong the many who seek Palermo Beach because they have the means of paying the price of its ultrasmart pleasures, are a percentage of foolish fakers who skimp and save just to have a brief moment among the glittering figurings of society. There is a pathetic side to this craze for pretending to be something which one is not hardearned dollars melt away as snow before a tropic sun and all real enjoyment is spoiled by the haunting fear that the hotel bill will exceed the limits of that painfully acquired vacation fund.\n\nOthers there are who go to Palermo with the hope of increasing their capital. They desire to profitably prey instead of paying. Sometimes fortune favors the crooked, but not often. Palermo is carefully guarded for the protection of its rich visitors. As for Henry’s, it is ringed and protected by all the means that money can buy. Still, no place is impregnable, and, given the incentive and the opportunity a woman can often do a lot more than a man.\n\nSome hours after the departure of the gambler who had lost seven thousand dollars, Henry retired to his private office for the pleasant task of recording the total of the nights winnings. Behind his chair was a safe of the most noted make. In front of him, on the table, was a basket containing a small fortune in ready cash. On his blotter was a leather-bound book fitted with a lock.\n\nThis was Henry’s register of takings, or more properly speaking, pickings. Under separate headings the gaming-house keeper entered the receipts of his tables. When he came to the entry of the amount taken in at the table where there was included in the total the item of seven thousand dollars, Henry did not give a thought to the doubts and misgivings he had had earlier in the evening. He was on the right side and could well afford to have a short memory. On the other hand, the man who loses is likely to remember and talk.\n\n“Good business,” muttered Henry as he lighted a cigar and started adding up the columns of figures. “Down here its not a case of one being born every minute. They come in pairs.”\n\nJust then Henry’s thoughts went scattering. He looked up from his book. He stared at the closed door. His cigar sagged from his mouth. What was that he had heard? Was there some disturbance outside, a scene within the exclusive portals of his house?\n\n“Sounded like a woman’s voice,” he muttered and, rising from his chair, made for the door. Before he could reach it there came a babble of voices. High above the deeper tones of men’s protests rose the shrill cry of a woman.\n\n“I must — I will see Mr. Henry,” she cried.\n\n“Hysterical. Cant have that. Making trouble. Howd they come to let her in?”\n\nMuttering to himself, Henry opened the door. His first thought was to preserve, at all costs, the dignity of his place. It was possible that the woman might start screaming. Her cries would be heard outside the building. Then — there would be talk, talk of a kind that might lead to unpleasant results.\n\n“Let the lady pass,” he ordered, but the look he gave the doorman was not good to see.\n\nWith her handkerchief pressed to her mouth with nervously trembling hands, the woman entered the office. She sank into a chair and commenced to sob pitifully.\n\nScowling with annoyance the gaming-house keeper snapped at the attendants to go about their business, and closed the door. He stood for a moment in silence. He knew that there was trouble brewing, and all his pity was for himself.\n\nIt is very annoying for a man of wealth and power to be disturbed by a strange woman, especially when she came with no suggestion in her manner of going away without getting what she wanted. She was in tears, but that did not imply that she would listen to reason. Quite the contrary.\n\nHenry straddled his legs and bit off the end of his cigar. He was bracing himself to handle the situation firmly and with dispatch.\n\n“What can I do for you?” he asked. The immediate answer was a choking, inarticulate sob.\n\nHenry grunted and repeated his question.\n\n“My — my husband,” faltered the woman. “He — he is ruined. He came here this evening. He lost — everything.”\n\n“That is not my fault. I never asked him to play. He took his chance like the rest. Whats his name?”\n\n“Randall, Richard Randall.”\n\n“Don’t know him. You must have made a mistake. He didn’t lose his money here.”\n\n“But he did. He told me how he got in with the Mandell party. He said he could make a fortune for us. And now — “\n\n“How much did he lose?” inquired Henry, his mind at once returning to the man his attention had been called to by his watcher. He guessed what the woman’s answer would be.\n\n“Seven thousand dollars,” she murmured brokenly.\n\n“Then what do you expect me to do?” asked Henry brusquely. “I’m not a philanthropist. I’m conducting a fair-and-square gambling house. If I lose I pay. Your husband will have to set to work and make some more money. That’s all there is to it.”\n\nThe woman raised her face. Her tragic eyes fixed on the gamblers. In those eyes of hers was not only sadness and despair, but a look of desperation that caused Henry to shiver for his good reputation.\n\n“He will not be able to make any money,” she said with odd quietness.\n\n“You mean he has “\n\nHenry paused on the word that would suggest tragedy, but the woman was quick enough to seize the unsaid.\n\n“No,” she exclaimed, “he has not done away with himself. Not yet. He has gone. But he will not escape. He cannot; the police — “\n\n“What do you mean? What have the police got to do with it?”\n\n“Everything. That money did not belong to us. My husband will be arrested. He will be sent to prison. He — I — “\n\nTo Henry this news was even worse than if the man had committed suicide. There would be a trial; the newspapers would ferret out all particulars. Henry would be ruined. The affair would be reported all over the country. There was only one thing to do. In one stride Henry reached the basket of money.\n\n“Do you know where your husband has gone?” he asked. “Can you reach him by wire?”\n\nThe woman’s gaze fastened on the bank notes in the gamblers hand. She sprang to her feet.\n\n“I can do better,” she cried. “I can go to him.”\n\n“Then you had better do so right away,” said Henry, and since circumstances had forced him to part with the money, he added as he handed over the seven thousand dollars, “Don’t let anybody tell you I ain’t got a heart.”\n\nThe woman’s face shone with joy. Henry’s smile of benevolence was somewhat crooked. It had been a matter of good policy to return the money, but it irked him to have done it. He turned to his desk.\n\nMurmuring a stream of grateful words the woman walked to the door.\n\n“Mind,” exclaimed Henry sharply as she laid her hand on the knob, “your husband is never to come here again.”\n\n“I’ll promise you that he will not,” said the woman, and softly closed the door.\n\nThree weeks later Henry came to a frowning halt as he strolled round his gambling hall. Play was in full swing. The tables were crowded, but — there was one person too many there. Henry went over the roulette table and touched a man on the shoulder.\n\n“Come into my office,” he whispered. “I must have a talk with you at once.”\n\nStifling an expression of surprise and displeasure the man complied.\n\n“What do you mean by coming here again ?” demanded Henry when they were in the privacy of his room. “Didn’t I give your wife back the seven thousand you lost here? Didn’t she promise me that you would never come here again? I dont have to ask your name. Your face is enough for me, Mr. Randall. I remember you.”\n\nFor a moment the other stared at the gaming-house keeper as if he thought he had taken leave of his senses. Then he laughed. The impudence of it enraged Henry. He became abusive. For a little while the other man let him have his fling. Then he held up his hand.\n\n“That’ll do,” he said curtly. “I’m going to let you down lightly, for its quite evident to me that you have been badly stung. My name is not Randall, and I have no wife. It is true that I was here about three weeks ago. It is also true that I lost seven thousand dollars. Since then I have been away on a trip. Golf does not come as high as roulette. I came back here to-night to give you some more of my good money. You are insulting a paying guest, Mr. Henry.”\n\n“But your — the woman?” gasped out the gambler.\n\n“Ill leave you to find the woman,” returned the other coldly. “All I can imagine is that she must have overheard me talking to some one in the hotel. She framed up a nice little sob story. Scared you, I suppose, and — got away with it. There’s only one thing for you to do.”\n\n“Whats that?” asked Henry eagerly.\n\n“Cherchez la femme,” retorted the other, and laughed cruelly.\n\nHenry has not yet found her.\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "I was working the late rewrite trick when the call came in. The night city editor took it, then cupped his hand over the mouthpiece and yelled at me.\n\n“This girl says she’s going to pull the dutch act. Talk to her while I try to trace it.”\n\nI cursed silently as I cut in on the extension. God damn women; there’s always one phoning the City Room and saying she’s going to kill herself. Either they’re drunk or want assurance that their homemade sendoff will make page one.\n\nI asked the girl her means of exit.\n\nA gun, she said.\n\nA gun, I told her, leaves a mess. So why didn’t she hike down to the corner drugstore for some sleeping pills?\n\nShe started whimpering.\n\nThat did it. I said this was a damn busy newspaper and suggested she hang up like a nice girl and hit the sack. Her voice became apologetic. She had mailed the newspaper a letter. Would I personally watch for it? She described the stationery and I said I would. She thanked me and blew her brains out.\n\nLater I went back to Morgue for a routine background check before I wrote her obit. I didn’t expect to find anything; her name meant nothing to me. But there was a skinny folder with Ann Hastings typed neatly in the corner. Inside were two clips — a brief story and a picture.\n\nThe story told of her graduation from college with highest honors three years ago. The picture showed an attractive brunette accepting congratulations from her parents. But it was a dark little man standing slightly to the side that caught my attention. I put an eye glass on him to make sure. It was Louis J. Oriole.\n\nLouie was top bully for the local political machine. A real nice fellow who got his kicks clobbering old women and children.\n\nWhat the hell was a guy like Louie doing at the college graduation of a girl like Ann?\n\nI went off duty at five in the morning and spent three hours in a bar trying for the answer. It wouldn’t come. I told no one about the picture or the letter. If there was a story, I wanted it for myself.\n\nI returned to the office just in time to catch a copy boy coming in off the early morning mail run. He tossed the first class mail on a desk and I picked out the letter in a couple of seconds — a blue envelope with red lettering.\n\nInside was a key to a locker at the Central Bus Terminal.\n\nThe brief case wasn’t locked. I pulled out a batch of papers. On top was a short letter signed by Ann Hastings.\n\nIt said her father was a ward leader who had borrowed money from Louie to put her through college. Louie, quite by accident, met her and his interest became more than academic. He offered her a job when she finished college. She accepted and inside a year was visiting him at home, on demand.\n\nThree weeks ago she had learned she was pregnant. She went to Louie. He gave her a thousand bucks and told her to make tracks — for keeps.\n\nShe decided to solo into eternity. But as a lasting memento to Louie, here were a few items the newspapers might be interested in.\n\nSweat erupted op the back of my neck. The story was mine, exclusive. It would be spread all over page one, under my by-line. There would be a bonus, journalism awards. I would be famous.\n\nI dashed to the street, looking for a car …\n\nI was smiling as I slowly returned to the bus station, put the brief case back in a locker, dropped the key in an envelope, addressed it to myself and mailed it.\n\nThen I headed for Louie’s office.\n\nTHE END\n"

Brogan\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nJuror No. 5\n\nBrad walked leadenly, eyes lustreless below his hatbrim, head turtled in the upturned collar of his overcoat. He didn’t know what he was going to do from one aimless step to the next. He began looking in the windows of the bars he passed. He might get drunk. Even a hangover would be pain that a man could deal with, something to blot out the deeper pain.\n\nOne hour ago he had been suspended as a Special Agent of the FBI. He, Brad Keating, was the sort of man who created feelings of fear instead of respect for the Bureau. As a trial witness he had sounded vindictive, inhuman, the Federal Prosecutor had said. He had swung jury sympathy, despite irrefutable evidence, to transform a vicious, murdering rat into a martyr. So the jury had failed to reach a verdict and Brogan was out on bail.\n\nAbruptly Brad stopped walking as he stared through the window of a bar. Sitting sideways on a front stool was the young woman who had been juror number five. She was looking across the shoulder of her caracul fur coat toward the window.\n\nAs at the trial, she wore her dark hair sleeked tight to one side of her head and massed loosely on the other side. It gave her a look of always carrying her head at a slight, mocking tilt. A beauty mark in the outer corner of one of her long, black eyes made that eye look longer. It accented the look of mockery, of secret knowledge, on her thin, pretty face.\n\nThe sight of her made Brad’s fists knot in his pockets. He was sure she was one of the jurors who had ignored all evidence and logic to side with a killer. Maudlin minds like hers, filled with muzzy ideas of criminal glamour, made a farce of the law. His face, with its strong upper breadth and sharp, decisive tapering below the cheekbones, came alive with anger.\n\nThe girl leaned forward slightly, her eyes slitting, the mass of hair along one side of her face swaying forward. She seemed to recognize him. Brad moved irritably away and stood against the wall, nerves and muscles locking against his raw fury.\n\nHe fought to distract himself. The walks surged with homebound office workers. Bright-faced girls hugging purses to their coats hurried along in groups, galoshes dumping the wet cement, their pent-up spirits spilling in exuberant chatter. Lights from cars, stores, marquees diffused softly through a lazy drift of fast-melting snow.\n\nHe looked and listened and still that mocking face was the only reality. He knew if he went near her his anger would whiplash. He forced himself to walk past the entrance door. But the tension held, relentless. He turned back and entered the bar.\n\nJust inside the door he stopped himself again, probed under his coat and got cigarettes from his suit pocket. He looked at everything but the girl once he had lighted up. A man left a back bar stool for a telephone booth, a waitress slapped playfully at a man drinking with a party in a booth.\n\nThe prosecutor had exaggerated Brad’s conduct as a witness. But the defense lawyer had made him lose his temper. He saw with a sudden insight that it would be intimidation of a juror, terrorism, for him to approach that girl in anger. He would be really proving that he was unfit to represent the Department of Justice.\n\nHe went over to the comer of the bar, his features eased.\n\n“Yours, sir?” a pleasant-faced bartender asked.\n\n“Bourbon. Any brand. Make it double. Water on the side.”\n\nHe felt sober enough now that he had his perspective to trust himself with a good drink. He let his glance slide toward the girl. She was staring fixedly at him. He nodded in simple, impersonal recognition. She seemed to wince, and her eyes widened.\n\nAt the sound of a phone, its ring subdued under the pleasant blurr of talk through the bar, the girl’s head snapped around. She stared as the proprietor at the cash register halfway down the bar answered the phone. There was a brittle set to her clear profile.\n\n“Is that call for me?” she called in a thin, almost shrill voice. “I’m Mrs. Mac-Nair. I told you I was expecting — “\n\nAs the proprietor nodded and came carrying the phone on an extension cord, the MacNair girl stood and reached for it. She grasped the handset before the proprietor had the instrument set on the bar in front of her. In her nervous haste she answered before the mouthpiece was near her face.\n\n“Hello,” she repeated. Her voice was ragged with anxiety. Several people along the bar stopped talking to look at her.\n\nThere was an intent set to her profile as she listened. Brad saw that she was swallowing repeatedly.\n\n“But I didn’t call them!” she blurted. “Wait. Please, wait. I swear I didn’t. I don’t know why. . . . Hello — hello — “ She began to jiggle the breaker bar. “Hello!” she said desperately.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Kidnappers\n\nA hush had fallen over the bar. She started to replace the handset when her thin hand began to shake violently. One end of the handset fell out of the cradle noisily.\n\n“You all right?” the proprietor asked worriedly, cradling the handset, peering at her as she slumped back on the stool.\n\nShe nodded numbly. She turned her head and directed a glassy stare at Brad. Her features showed the pallor of shock. She kept looking at him, and although she seemed unable to speak he knew she was trying to communicate with him. He went to her.\n\n“Why did you come here, Mr. Keating?” she said, barely aloud. “My little girl has been kidnapped. Now they may kill her. They think I called the FBI.”\n\nHer anguish, somehow more terrible because of her effort to control it, made Brad’s throat constrict. He checked the flood of extraneous questions he wanted to ask.\n\n“When they contact you again — “\n\n“They won’t!” she cried.\n\n“Tell them I was suspended. I’m not an FBI man. Tell them to check. It’s true. And I know they’ll contact you again.”\n\nHe spoke rapidly, then turned and edged through the little group that had crowded around. He moved rapidly back along the bar, his gaze trained narrowly on the phone booth. It was empty. He scanned booths and bar and failed to see the man who had gone to that phone booth just after he came in and just before the call to Mrs. MacNair.\n\nBrad veered over to a vacant bar stool, beckoned the bartender who stood drawing a beer and peering toward the activity in the front.\n\n“Do you remember a short, thick-set man in a light gray hat and dark blue overcoat who was sitting along the bar here?”\n\n“Yeah. Ed Kromm. He went back to the phone. What happened to Mrs. MacNair up there? What’s she crying about? You a cop?”\n\n“I’m not a cop. I’m just looking for this guy. He’s not in the phone booth. You don’t remember seeing him come out?”\n\n“I didn’t even know he wasn’t still back there,” the bartender said, squinting toward the booth. “I guess he must be up front.”\n\nA blonde with a Martini at the next stool motioned to Brad with her head. He moved near.\n\n“That fellow he called Kromm went out the back way. He just left just before you came back here.”\n\n“Thanks.”\n\nBrad went through the back door into a deserted rectangular areaway at the foot of the building’s back stairs. He stood an instant listening for a footstep or a telltale creak from above. Hearing nothing, he moved silently across to the pair of double doors which he calculated would open into the alley. Then he looked down at the concrete floor. It was bone dry.\n\nBrad depressed the latch-release crossbar of one of the doors, opened it experimentally. As he had anticipated, an inward draft brought the snow swirling inside. It lay a slanting wet strip on the concrete.\n\nBrad went back into the bar, his eyes flicking at once to the place where his helpful blonde friend had sat. She was gone. He spotted her an instant later hurrying along in back of the short, stubby overcoated figure of Ed Kromm.\n\nThey were out the front door before Brad was halfway to the front. Following swiftly, he angled his glance toward Mrs. MacNair, who sat covering her face with her hands, the center of worried attention from a dozen people including the proprietor. A quick pang went through Brad’s chest. He would never forgive himself if anything happened to her little girl as a result of his coming in here, with hate in his heart.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nKromm and the Blonde\n\nOutside, Brad saw Kromm and the blonde getting in a cab twenty feet to the right. When the blonde was in, Kromm paused to stare back at the bar. Even through the luminous snow curtain Brad knew Kromm saw him. If it had been Kromm who phoned Mrs. MacNair, he would figure Brad as one strand in a closing FBI net. His nerve might unravel to the point of killing the child under that pressure. Kromm ducked swiftly into the cab.\n\nBrad set out at a driving, broken-field run, leaving a wake of startled pedestrians. The blonde’s face showed in a ghostly oval at the back window as Brad left the curb, his slamming feet splashing the gutter slush. The cab’s motor growled and an expanding vapor plume rose from the exhaust as the cab rolled away in first. Brad spurted and shot an arm ahead. He struck with the flat of his hand against the high rear fender several times.\n\nThe loud drumming alerted the driver, who locked brakes. The sharp red glare of brake lights leaped to life and smeared in a vivid pink cloud through the exhaust vapor. The cab rocked gently on its springs as Brad grabbed the back door handle and wrenched the door open.\n\nOn the seat beside the open door Kromm’s thick upper body leaned forward toward Brad like a tilted block. His head tilted back like a smaller counterbalance, green eyes looking up at Brad. The top button of Kromm’s dark overcoat was unbuttoned and his right hand was thrust in under the coat. He sat frozen in the middle of a draw from a shoulder holster.\n\nBrad raised his hand very slowly and unbuttoned the top button of his overcoat. There was a deadly, nerveless control in the motion of his fingers. Threat lines formed about his eyes and hardened the sharp lower part of his face like a cutting wedge.\n\nKromm sat spellbound, his awe of an FBI man’s reputation for speed and accuracy turning him into a spectator watching a miracle. Brad slid his hand under his opened coat and then remained as motionless as Kromm. He didn’t have a gun. But Kromm didn’t know it.\n\nKromm blinked rapidly and some of the dark color of his square red face seeped away. He waited for Brad to break the stalemate. Brad did nothing for what seemed an eternity. He let the pressure build.\n\nThen Kromm began to seem aware of the crowd gathered on the sidewalk, of the slack-mouthed blonde beside him, of the cabbie staring hypnotized back at them. He kept looking back at Brad, but it was clear he wanted distraction, escape; he couldn’t bear the tension. And that was just the advantage Brad wanted to make sure that that motionless gun ann of Kromm’s stayed harmless.\n\nBrad said quietly, “Maybe you know that a special agent never draws a gun except as a final resort. Before an FBI man draws a gun he must be convinced that there is no other way out except by shooting to kill. I hope I never have to do that. Take your hand slowly out of your coat, mister. Bring it out in the open very, very slowly, and empty.”\n\nThe blonde shrilled, “Do like he said, Ed! He ain’t going to shoot unless you shoot. Do like he said!”\n\nKromm withdrew his hand, empty. Brad ducked into the cab, shutting the door to extinguish the interior lights. Crouching over Kromm in the semi-darkness, he reached in and withdrew the flat, heavy .45 automatic from the shoulder holster. Palming the gun, he pulled out a jump-seat with his other hand. He eased his weight onto the seat, facing back toward the pair, covering them with the gun. The crowd of curious onlookers on the walk was growing.\n\n“Let’s get away from the crowd,” Brad told the driver. “Go around the block, then stop at the bar just back of us.”\n\n“Suits me.” The cab pulled away. “You’re a Fed, huh?”\n\nBrad sidestepped an answer. “This is a kidnap case. Did they tell you where to take them?”\n\n“Kidnap!” The driver swore as they had to stop in a line waiting for a traffic signal and revved the motor with noisy impatience. “They give me an address. Fifteenth and Eastway. I’m knocking my brains to remember what’s special out there…. Hey — I got it! A girl’s boarding school is there in the old General Herschell home.”\n\nAs the cab moved and made the corner turn. Brad directed his gaze at the blonde. “That where the kid is?” he asked.\n\nShe regarded him in sullen silence. He could see only one of her hands, resting on the suede purse on the lap of her fur coat. Her other hand was in the purse. He reached out, locked his fingers around the forearm of the hand inside the purse. He jerked her arm straight up.\n\n“What the hell!” she shrilled as the purse contents spilled onto her lap, the seat and floor. He could feel the steely set of her forearm muscles under her coat sleeve.\n\n“Unclench the fist, honey,” Brad said smoothly, tightening the pressure of his fingers. He freed her arm suddenly as a shiny little nickel-plated revolver dropped from the purse. He caught the gun as it slid from her coat to the seat space between her and Kromm. He pocketed the gun.\n\n“Now, what were you saying about Fifteenth and Eastway?”\n\n“Nobody said nothing!” Kromm blustered.\n\n“Have it your way,” Brad said. “But don’t tickle my trigger finger by finding more guns before I can frisk you.”\n\nThe crowd had dispersed when the cab completed circuit of the block. Brad spoke tersely to the driver.\n\n“This is the bar,” Brad said. The cab parked. “The mother of the victim is inside. A Mrs. MacNair, a dark-haired pretty woman, about twenty-five. She’s at the front.”\n\n“I’ll get her.” The driver crossed the walk at an aggressive swagger, head ducked forward. He opened the door of the bar, planted himself on the sill and bellowed.\n\n“Where’s Mrs. MacNair? You her, lady? C’mon, follow me then. It’s important.”\n\nThe driver marched back to the cab, scowling. The MacNair girl followed, trim legs in fur-top galoshes in rapid motion, the strip of dark pleated skirt below the hem of her caracul fur coat jouncing. Flakes of snow caught briefly in the soft mass of hair along one side of her head. Brad swung the door open for her, pulled down the other jump seat.\n\n“What is it, Mr. Keating?” she said, her voice low and vibrant. She blinked away a weightless flake of snow that settled in her eye lashes as she entered. She sat on the jump seat and swivelled her body around.\n\nThe driver shut the door and got in. “Fifteen and Eastway, chief?”\n\n“Right,” Brad said.\n\nThe MacNair girl caught the back of the front seat and the back of the jump seat, balancing her taut body between her hands as the cab started with a jolt. Her dark eyes cast nervous, questioning’ glances at the pair on the back seat, at the gun Brad held, at Brad’s face.\n\n“Do you know these people, Mrs. MacNair?”\n\n“No I don’t,” she said, staring fixedly at Kromm and then at the blonde.\n\n“Mr. Kromm is going to talk to you,” Brad said. “See if you know his voice.”\n\nKromm sagged lumpishly against the back cushion, directing a steady, baleful glare at Brad. His mouth tightened visibly.\n\n“Mr. Kromm,” Brad repeated, leaving a threatening space between each word, “is going to talk to you. He will say: ‘Mrs. MacNair, you were warned not to call the FBI.’ “\n\nThe girl’s upper body stiffened. “That’s almost exactly the words the man used,” she breathed.\n\nKromm shifted irritably. One side of his face was illumined from store lights through the windows. Brad could see the quick pulselike bulging and relaxing of his jaw muscles.\n\n“Why won’t he talk?” the MacNair girl cried angrily. “If he’s not the one then he’s not.”\n\nKromm’s voice exploded in profanity. Then he demanded. “Take me in and book me so I can get a mouthpiece, G-man. I know my rights. Book me. You got nothing on me.”\n\nMrs. MacNair spoke, and for a moment her voice shocked Brad. There was a coldness and a hollow quality to it as though it rose from a deep cavern.\n\n“That’s the man who telephoned me, Mr. Keating. That is the voice. Where is Sandra, Mr. Kromm? Where is my child?”\n\n“Look here, I never phoned this babe. I don’t know nothing, G-man. Take me in right now, see? I want a mouthpiece.”\n\n“I am not a G-man, Mr. Kromm. I was fired this afternoon.”\n\n“Then leave me out of here, damn you! You got no right to hold me.”\n\nThe MacNair girl said: “He’s the man, Mr. Keating.”\n\n“I know it. Kromm, I told you I’ve been suspended as a special agent. I was suspended because 1 sounded like a terrorist at a murder trial. I’ve never had the pleasure of letting down the bars and acting like one, though. Nothing’s stopping me now! I’m free of obligation to treat you as though you were entitled to civilized judicial processes. And if you don’t lead me to that child I’m going to kill you.”\n\n“Hell, what more you want, huh? You’re goin’ to the kid, ain’t you?”\n\nThe blonde cried: “Listen, that kid don’t even know she is kidnapped. All we done was take her and put her in the school. We just wanted Mrs. MacNair to think the kid was kidnapped, that’s all!”\n\n“All!” Mrs. MacNair cried. “I’ve been crazy with it!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Note\n\nShe turned forward on the jump seat. Brad watched in puzzlement as she crossed a leg over her knee. She bent and tugged her furtop galosh off. The shoe came with it. She thrust a hand inside and maneuvered the high-heel black suede pump out. She began to gouge with her nails at an edge of the sole. She worked a finger into a gap and then pulled, ripping the stitching of the sole. She took a folded envelope out.\n\n“I saved this,” she said tensely, turning sideways on the seat toward Brad, unfolding the envelope. She pulled out a sheet of paper.\n\n“Read this.”\n\n“I can’t, now. Read it to me.”\n\n“It’s typed. It says: ‘We have Sandra. If you want to see her again do not report this. Vote for acquittal. It is up to you to be there to vote, so don’t try falling sick or in any way disqualifying yourself. Save his life, save her life. Bribe the bellboy to get you to a phone. Call your home to verify. Warn your sister and brother-in-law to remain as silent as you. Destroy this.’ It wasn’t addressed to me by name, and it wasn’t signed.”\n\n“It mentions bellboy,” Brad said. “Did you get it while you were in the hotel where the jury was quartered?”\n\n“Yes. The bellboy came with icewater that I hadn’t ordered. Last night. He gave me the note. He thought it was a message about my little girl from my family; he knew I missed the baby and he thought he was doing me a favor.\n\n“I didn’t have to bribe him to get to a phone. He spirited me to a room that I could call from. We weren’t permitted outside phone service in the rooms assigned to us, you know. We weren’t supposed to talk to anybody. I phoned Sis. I live with her and her husband since my husband died two years ago. Sis told me it was true, the baby was gone. I swore her and my brother-in-law to secrecy. I said I’d stay on that jury and keep it from convicting.\n\n“Mr. Keying, I knew he was a murderer, and a terrible man. The evidence you presented, and all your testimony showed it; it was so horribly clear just what sort Brogan was, that — that I was paralyzed. I had to vote as I did. I didn’t have any real choice.”\n\n“Of course you didn’t,” Brad said, his voice soft. He turned to Kromm and said harshly: “How’d you get the child?”\n\nThe blonde answered.\n\n“I had a phony policewoman’s badge and fake credentials. The credentials were all ready for me when me and Ed hit town yesterday. Brogan’s mouthpiece gave them to me.”\n\n“You mean,” Brad asked incredulously, “that you were actually aided and abetted by an attorney in kidnapping for the purpose of intimidating a juror? And he provided the means for impersonation of an officer of the law for criminal purposes?”\n\n“In English, hell yes.”\n\n“And you two were imported for the job? Where from?”\n\n“L.A. — Brogan’s mouthpiece phoned the boss out there, offering five Gs for imported talent. Things ain’t been goin’ so good for me in the acting business for a few years, and Ed here lost his private-eye license. We were into the boss for over a grand. We never knew what the setup was going to be when we hopped the plane. All we knew was it was a job.”\n\n“In eager innocence you thought it would be a part in a show for the benefit of homeless crippled orphans!” Brad said bitingly.\n\n“How’d you guess? Well, anyways, J. Brogan’s mouthpiece had everything set up. He’d had private eyes getting the lowdown on every juror. He knew all their family connections. The MacNair dame here had a setup that looked like she’d hurt easiest. So it wasn’t nothing personal with me. That’s how life Is, ain’t it? Find out the soft spot and hit there.\n\n“So I went out to the MacNair dame’s sister and I had a typed note with a fake signature. I showed my badge and said I was attached to the court and I didn’t know what was in the note, but I knew the juror had received permission to have her little daughter spend the night in the hotel with her. I showed my gun and convinced her I intended to protect the court’s interests, and the child was the court’s interest. I gave a little line about being a mother myself — so anyway I got the kid.\n\n“Ed and me brought her to the school. I posed as the kid’s aunt. I told the woman who runs the place that the kid had been promised she’d see her mother, so she might cry, but it was impossible for her mother to get back to town for another day, and I had to leave. The school wasn’t suspicious because nobody knew there was a kidnapping. Then Ed phoned the sister and told her it was a snatch and to keep her trap shut until she heard from the kid’s mother. By then Ed had figured the bellhop would have got the note to Mrs. MacNair.”\n\n“Hell!” Brad said. “Brogan’s lawyer went through all that? For what? He couldn’t intimidate the whole jury. Brogan will be re-tried. He’ll never get acquittal!”\n\nKromm laughed coarsely. “Don’t bet on that, Fed!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe School\n\nBrad’s motion was so unplanned, so swift that it shocked him. He lashed out with the gun and clubbed Kromm over the eye. The MacNair girl gasped involuntarily beside him. The blonde merely stiffened, watching apprehensively. Kromm made a short, grunting sound and put his hand up to his head. The blow had cut the skin, and a little blood trickled down toward the corner of his eye.\n\nBrad eased back, feeling the rapid pound of his heart. He had to keep a better grip than this on himself — at least until that child was safe.\n\nThe driver called back: “Next street’s Fifteenth, chief. The school’s around the corner on Fifteenth.”\n\n“Good. Sooner we’re there the better. Soon as you drop us off call the police, will you?”\n\n“Sure will, chief!”\n\nKromm hunched forward and spoke in a grating jeer.\n\n“Brogan’s next trial will be another song, Fed! The government didn’t show all its hand to get the indictment. But it put every card on the table during that trial, pal. Including a couple of witnesses you had kept secret. Well, they ain’t secret now. And by the next round in court they won’t be worth a damn as witnesses. They got families, too! Like Mrs. MacNair! Get it? And furthermore that mouthpiece is smart enough to take every other point of evidence that you laid out on the table for him and knock the props out from under it. And if you blast me to hell, remember, Fed, I’ll be laughing at you down there — and waiting for you. And I won’t have to wait long!”\n\n“He sure won’t,” the blonde said. “Because, tough-guy Fed, Brogan knows that you ain’t the kind of a witness that can be intimidated. He knows there’s only one way to stop you. Keep thinkin’ about it!”\n\nThe cab was turning the corner onto Fifteenth. Mrs. MacNair gave a final tug to her galosh, then sat biting her underlip, peering ahead. Suddenly she reached over and clutched the sleeve of his overcoat, as though she had to cling to something.\n\n“I can’t stand it,” she whispered hoarsely. “They wouldn’t talk that way to you if they didn’t think you might kill them. And you wouldn’t kill them unless — unless — “\n\n“Don’t lose your grip! The child will be there. And safe. I know that. I know!” He repeated, needing the emphasis to convince himself.\n\nThe cab slowed before the twin globes of light surmounted on pillars flanking the schoolgrounds entrance. Beyond the gates, which were closed, Brad could see the glow of lights from all the four floors of the converted mansion. The cab stopped, and he spotted an open walk alongside the driveway gates. Opposite the grounds was a big, blue sedan parked across the street.\n\nMrs. MacNair swung open the door, stepped out. Brad followed shortly, backing his way out, keeping Kromm and the blonde covered. Brad spoke rapidly over his shoulder, giving orders to the MacNair girl:\n\n“Go on into the grounds, fast. Get inside the school. Get the police from there. Run!”\n\nShe didn’t answer in words, but streaked through the walk entrance and out of sight. Brad glanced again over the top of the cab at the sedan. It seemed to be unoccupied. Both the blonde and Kromm were looking transfixedly at that car, moving in slow-motion silence to get out of the cab. Then they were on the walk beside him. He shut the cab door and the driver pulled away fast, the cab tires kicking up a spray.\n\nBrad said: “Even if that is Brogan’s car across there it won’t do you a damned bit of good. Get headed up the walk to the school.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nJ. Brogan\n\nThere was a sharp crack of sound. Kromm coughed, a deep, choppy sound, and his mouth fell open and he stared and toppled toward Brad. Brad whipped around, dropped to one knee and fired across at the sedan. One of the windows was down, and the barrel of a rifle pointed toward them.\n\nHis first shot shattered a front wing window. The rifle fired again and he heard the bullet rip into Kromm’s body.\n\nThe blonde had started to run, shrieking in terror, along the sidewalk toward Eastway. She ran past the school entrance and the glow from the globes atop the entrance pillars outlined her clearly. Suddenly her arms leaped up and to the sides as though she had taken off into space flight. But the impact of the rifle bullet in her back drove her upper body too fast for her legs and she hit the wet cement walk face down, and she didn’t stir or make a sound.\n\nThe rifleman’s body had been clearly visible for seconds, but it dropped from view as the blonde fell. Brad held his fire and charged the car. The rifle barrel came out the window at an upslant, and started to lower as the rifleman’s body came up into view.\n\nBrad didn’t give him a chance to take aim. He fired at close range through the window. He fired again and a third time. The rifle thumped onto the floor inside the car. Brad pulled open the door, and Brogan with his face half shot away fell out onto the street, dead.\n\nBrad let him lie. He went into the school grounds and up onto the veranda of the old building. A group of elderly women and high school girls in starchy white-collared gray uniforms were clustered about the open door. They stared at him as if he were a ghost and opened a path for him.\n\nThe MacNair girl was in the office laughing hysterically, one arm convulsing and relaxing around the chunky little body of a solemnly pigtailed little moppet in a pinafore. The moppet squinted up at him suspiciously and suddenly asked indignantly :\n\n“Did you get my Mommy drunk?”\n\n“No, darling. No.” He crouched down before her. “I just told her funny stories.”\n\n“Well, I don’t think I want you to do that any more.”\n\n“He won’t, baby. He won’t.”\n\n“Would you like it if it was you I told the funny stories to?” Brad asked, grinning.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“All right, it’s a date. Tomorrow night.”\n\nHe got up and went over to a telephone on a rolltop desk. He started dialing the local FBI number, watching the two of them.\n\nThe MacNair woman looked across her daughter’s head at him. That look of mockery was illusory, he was sure. But whether or not, it was going to be decidedly worth while finding out.\n\nTHE END\n"

He had a little basement shop where he dealt in second hand automobile parts. He lived in the rear of the store and the Square knew him as an inventor. It did not know what he invented, but it was accustomed to seeing a light in the store at all hours. If one looked down into the black areaway they could see the old man at work among his tools, his ragged gray beard drooping over his bench.\n\nOne day Christopher Square hummed with news concerning Old Man Johnson.\n\nBig Harry Westley, the King of Con Men, discussed the news with Lefty Blumfeld, alias Morrison Taylor, over a table in the front room of the West Side Social Club, located at the end of the Square. Westley was large, florid and impressive. Crook-dom respected his genius. It was said that Westley could cut Central Park up into building lots and sell them for cash. He had served two jail terms, but had lost none of his nerve or pompous exterior.\n\nLefty Blumfeld, alias Morrison Taylor, was undersized. He was built along the lines of a gorilla. He had a low, bulging forehead and beady black eyes. His bull neck was short and thick. His hands were covered with coarse black hair. They were gnarled and pitted from laboratory work. He made nitro-glycerine for petermen and blasters when he was not out on a job himself. He had done a stretch of six years in the State penitentiary and was as rapacious and merciless as a colled cobra.\n\n“Did you hear the news about Old Man Johnson?” Westley inquired, lighting a fat cigar with a flourish.\n\nBlumfeld tossed off three fingers of underground rye whiskey. He dried his lips on the back of his hand.\n\n“No. What about him?”\n\nThe big con man tilted back his chair and chuckled.\n\n“Everyone is talking about Old Man Johnson. He sold an invention to some big company up the state. He’s been paid ten thousand dollars in advance royalties. Charlie Hill saw the check and so it’s not air. The old geezer has cleaned up. Ten grands — I guess that’s rotten.”\n\nBlumfeld ran his finger around the inside rim of his whiskey glass.\n\n“What’s the invention?” he asked after a pause.\n\nWestley shook his head and shrugged.\n\n“Search me. Nobody seems to know. Charlie Hill asked him, but Johnson said it was a secret. It must be something good or he wouldn’t have got such dough.”\n\nBlumfeld nodded moodily.\n\n“Yes, it must be,” he said.\n\nWestley flicked the ash from the end of his cigar and chuckled again.\n\n“Ten thousand dollars,” he observed reflectively, “is a lot of dough. I’ll have to wander up to Moy Ling’s after awhile and smoke a couple of pipes of scatnish. Poppy makes me dream clever schemes. I was full of hop the time I took that Florida lawyer for his currency kick. Old Man Johnson isn’t used to sudden wealth. I’ll dream out a way to separate him from his cash. When I get it I’ll buy you the best dinner in town, Lefty.”\n\n“Like hell!” Blumfeld grunted.\n\nWestley smiled and looked at his watch. He stood up and pulled down his waistcoat. He placed seventy-five cents on the table to pay for the liquor he had consumed and fingered his closely shaven chin.\n\n“Well, I’ve got to be moving. Be good to yourself and be leary of the red-necks. I’ve just got about six minutes to grab a short.”\n\nHe nodded affably and moved away. Through the front windows of the club Blumfeld saw him stride briskly across the square. The nitro-glycerine expert sat stiffly still. Ten thousand dollars! He hardly knew there was so much money in the world. And it was in the possession of a doddering inventor who lived in a mean cellar!\n\nBlumfeld’s beady eyes glittered. When he considered the magnitude of the sum he felt dazed. For a long interval he sat with expressionless face and staring eyes. After a time he got up. He took a few steps toward the door, returned and picked up the seventy-five cents Big Harry Westley had laid on the table. He shoved it into his pocket, deciding he needed it more than the waiter.\n\nSlouching out of the club, he descended the front steps and stepped onto the cracked pavement of Christopher Square. The late September afternoon was dying in a conflagration of sunset fire. The sky was brazen with raw scarlet, amethyst and silver-and-purple. Lights were winking in the waterfront rigging, a block distant. The river was boisterous with the voice of sirens and the shrill of whistles. The wraith of evening shook out her black draperies that were pinned with stars.\n\nBlumfeld turned east. He walked two blocks. He came in sight of the building in the cellar of which Old Man Johnson maintained his shop. He saw the inventor’s ancient sign hanging from its metal stanchion like a one-legged acrobat. Drawing close to the areaway, Blumfeld leaned over and peered down. Somewhere in the shop below an oil lamp burned. In its uncertain radiance Blumfeld observed the stooped figure of the proprietor.\n\nTurning to the iron stairway that led steeply down into the basement, Blumfeld drew his lips back over his teeth and smiled. He descended the steps and opened the front door. He entered and closed it after him.\n\nThe shop was warm and stuffy with the odor of paint and grease. Blumfeld hardly noticed it. His quick gaze darted to the work-bench over which Old Man Johpson hung. He saw the inventor was old and feeble. The eyes of the man were blue and faded. His skin was wrinkled like yellow parchment. He wore a disreputable old pair of oil-stained trousers, a collarless flannel shirt that exposed his turkey neck and a pencil-stuffed vest held together by one button.\n\n“You got a second hand drive shaft for a Brown and Blue taxi?” Blumfeld said, as the inventor looked up.\n\nOld Man Johnson shook his head.\n\n“No, I haven’t,” he said in a thin husky voice.\n\nBlumfeld allowed his gaze to wander about the place.\n\n“Got any gears or transmission parts?”\n\nThe inventor shook his white head again.\n\n“No, I don’t think I have. All the parts are piled up in the corner over there. I’m going out of business, so if you find anything you can use you can have it at your own price.”\n\nHe indicated a heap of metal stacked up in one corner. Blumfeld shuffled across to it. He pawed idly over it. While he did this he plumbed the room with his beady eyes. He made a mental photograph of the way the shop was arranged, of a single window that opened on to an alley running past it, and of a door that went into what was presumably the living quarters of the inventor.\n\nWhen he had observed all that interested him, Blumfeld straightened up and turned his back on the heap of metal.\n\n“Find anything?” Old Man Johnson asked.\n\nBlumfeld shook his head.\n\n“No. I’ll come around next week. Maybe you’ll have a shaft picked up by then.”\n\nThe inventor smiled faintly.\n\n“I won’t be here next week. I’m selling out. I’m going out of business. I’m leaving for Rochester on Monday. I’m an inventor and I only kept this little place here until I struck oil.”\n\nBlumfeld allowed himself to look impressed.\n\n“Is that right? So you struck oil. I guess that means you sold an invention. You must have knocked out large kale if you’re going to Rochester.”\n\nThe interest of his caller appeared to please the old man. He wiped his hands on a piece of cotton waste and put some tobacco in the bowl of his black pipe.\n\n“It took me twenty years to perfect my invention,” he explained, with a touch of pride. “Many times I thought I had made it, only to discover some hidden flaw. People I told about it said it couldn’t be done and thought I was crazy to even try it. Three months ago I knew I had triumphed. I put the invention to every possible test and it made good. I applied for a patent and sent my work to a big manufacturing concern in Rochester. They tested it for two months and then agreed to purchase the right to manufacture it. They sent me ten thousand dollars and a contract. I’m going to Rochester, as I said, to take charge of the making of them.”\n\nBlumfeld, receiving verification of Big Harry’s statement, felt satisfaction tingling keenly within him. He had almost believed that it was opium that put the words in the mouth of the big con man.\n\n“So you got ten thousand dollars,” he murmured. “That’s a lot of money. You want to hold on to it tight. I guess you know the Square is a pretty tough place. Don’t let no one bunk the jack away from you, or stick you up for it.”\n\nOld Man Johnson looked serious.\n\n“Never fear, I won’t. I have it hidden where no one can find it. It’s safe.”\n\nBlumfeld smiled.\n\n“That’s the eye! Hang onto it. I’m sorry you ain’t got what I’m after. Good luck to you when you get to Rochester.”\n\nAt the door Blumfeld stopped, seized by a sudden thought.\n\n“By the way,” he said, “what was it you invented?”\n\nThe inventor picked up a file from the bench.\n\n“It’s a secret,” he replied slowly. “It’s a secret until it’s put on the market — “\n\nAt eleven o’clock Blumfeld emerged from the east side stuss house where he had run his purloined seventy-five cents up to six dollars. A pleasant sense of success swam in his blood. His good fortune was an omen that fickle Luck smiled upon him. On such a night as this he might conquer in any deed in wdiich he figured or any endeavor he applied his hand to.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Pleasant Stream of Imagination\n\nAt the corner of the street he traversed he boarded a surface car. He rode twelve blocks and transferred to a cross-town car. The second car took him as far as Harrigan Avenue, where he alighted. He continued east, treading a labyrinth of side streets that emptied like sewers along the waterfront. Where the river’s breath was damp, foul and cold, Blumfeld turned south. A few minutes later he entered Christopher Square by its west termination.\n\nHe passed the social club where he had sat and talked with Big Harry. The strains of jazz crept out through lighted windows. Evidently a dance was in progress. He wondered if it was all right to stop oft for a hooker of illicit whiskey. He decided not to and quickened his step as if to outpace temptation. When the ten thousand dollars of Old Man Johnson’s was his he could buy a hundred cases of hootch. He could fill a tub full of rye and bathe in it if he so desired.\n\nThe pleasant stream of imagination he floated down emptied him into the bayou of Broken Dreams. He shook himself as he sighted his destination. The hanging sign of the inventor loomed before him — the black areaway of the basement shop which was as dark as the inside of a pocket. Blumfeld made sure his movements were not being observed and squatted down. He looked into the shop as far as he could but saw no trace of any light.\n\nArising, he surveyed the Square. Music still seeped out from the club. No loiterer shuffled through the shadows. He descended the areaway stairs. The door he had opened earlier in the evening confronted him. Quick inspection told Blumfeld it was locked and bolted on the inside in such a way as to make forcing it impossible. He muttered a curse and crept down the area way. He climbed a fence and dropped down into an alley that fringed the building. He came upon the single window of the shop and drew a breath of satisfaction when he found the top pane was lowered an inch or two. It was the work of a minute to draw the lower sash up, swing quietly across the sill and step down onto the floor of the store.\n\nSo much accomplished without mishap, Blumfeld grew cautious. Old Man Johnson was an inventor. It was likely he had rigged up some device that would make known the presence of an intruder. Blumfeld knew he would have to be wary or he would stumble into a snare. He opened the blade of a large, heavy knife and felt his way to the door that opened into the living rooms beyond.\n\nTwice he stubbed his foot on some bit of metal lying about. He reached the door without accident otherwise and felt about the frame. At first he discovered nothing, then as he dug his nails into the plaster he found the presence of a number of fine, silk-covered wires. He cut them one at a time and dropped a hand to the knob of the door.\n\nIt opened at his touch with scarce a creak.\n\nBlumfeld passed into stark blackness perfumed with the reek of a kerosene lamp. Its odor took him carefully across the room. He discovered the location of the lamp and felt its chimney. Its warmth told him it had been extinguished only a short time.\n\nBlumfeld turned slowly. He must learn if this room was the bedchamber of the inventor or not. He longed to kindle a match, but knew its glare would betray him if Johnson was awake. He began to step forward, laying his hand against the furniture it encountered. He touched a chair and a small table, but they told him nothing. He had no way of knowing where he was until his knees suddenly came in contact with something cold and hard and investigation caused him to expel a breath of relief. His exploring hands felt a mattress and a blanket.\n\nWhile he considered the next move, Blumfeld stiffened cautiously. The bed creaked with the weight of some one turning over in it. After what seemed an eternity, a thin, husky voice came out of the staring murk.\n\n“I have a fully loaded revolver covering you! I will — “\n\nBlumfeld did not wait to hear the rest of it. With a snarl he flung himself forward. He crashed against a figure that fell back with a soft cry, a cry that was abruptly shut off by the grip of his fingers.\n\nSomething hard clattered to the floor with a dull, metallic ring.\n\nWisps of heard scratched Blumfeld’s face.\n\nWith his free hand he ripped a piece from the blanket, wadded it together and stuffed it into the man’s mouth, forcing his jaws open and digging a knee into his stomach so that no scream might awake discordant echoes.\n\nWhen he had neatly gagged his victim he ended weak struggles with a vicious blow and using other strips of the blanket bound Johnson’s wrists and ankles tightly together.\n\nStepping away from the bed Blumfeld struck a match.\n\nHe turned up the wick of the oil lamp and lighted it. The room boasted two windows and both displayed drawn shades. It was sparsely furnished as a bedroom, containing a bureau with a mirror, table, chair and trunk. Blumfeld dropped down on the top of the trunk. He dug out the stub of a cigarette from his pocket and after kindling it looked casually at the trussed up man on the bed. He grinned when the faded blue eyes met his bravely and steadily.\n\n“I came back,” Blumfeld said. “I came back to get them ten thousand smackers you were bragging about. If you come clean with me you won’t get hurt. If you try any funny stuff you’ll never go to Rochester. You’ll go to a place where money ain’t no use. Nod your head if you understand.”\n\nThe inventor nodded. Blumfeld picked up the revolver from the floor and pocketed it.\n\n“Are you ready to tell me where the money is at? Nod yes or no.”\n\nThe old man inclined his head. Blumfeld crossed to him and leaned over.\n\n“I’m going to slip the gag out of your peep. If you open your trap to yell I’ll cave in your conk!”\n\nHe removed the makeshift gag and the inventor licked his lips.\n\n“C’mon, spit out the dope!” Blumfeld ordered impatiently.\n\n“I will tell you nothing!” the old man said huskily. “What it took me twenty years to earn I will share with no one! No matter what you do to me no information will pass my lips! I will meet my fate unafraid! And I will know that you cannot escape the consequences of your crime! The work of my hand and the child of my brain will reach out, even from the grave, and overtake you!”\n\nWith a snarl Blumfeld jammed the gag back into the inventor’s mouth. He pushed the old man savagely back among the pillows and struck him again with his fist. For a few minutes he sat silent, his face dark with thought. At length he stood up, slapped his thigh with a exclamation and walked to the lamp. He opened the blade of his heavy knife and laid it across the mouth of the chimney, looking back at the cot with a wide grin.\n\n“Maybe a little burning on the soles of your feet will make you loosen up! I’ll torture you before I croak you, and even if you don’t tell me what I want to know I’ll find out! I’ll turn these rooms upside down!”\n\nHe lifted the knife from the chimney and saw that its blade had turned white-hot. He wrapped his handkerchief around the handle and with a single move drew the sheets and blankets off the bed. …\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Invention\n\nThree days later as Blumfeld slouched out of the east side lodging-house where he roomed, a man stepped across the pavement and laid a hand on his arm. Synchronously another man stepped out of the passing crowd and caught hold of his left arm, moving it up and out.\n\nBefore Blumfeld could draw a breath, something cold encircled each wrist — a sharp click sounded.\n\n“You are wanted, Lefty!” the first man said briefly. “Charge of bumping off Old Man Johnson, the inventor, down on Christopher Square last week!”\n\nBlumfeld lifted his face, his lips drawn back over his yellow teeth.\n\n“You’re crazy with the heat!” he snarled. “I haven’t been on Christopher Square in two weeks. I’ve been away. I’ve been in Chi — “\n\nThe second man smiled.\n\n“There is no use of lying, Lefty. We have Old Man Johnson’s invention down at headquarters. It showed us who croaked him and told us who to look for. We’ve got the man — you are he!”\n\nBlumfeld licked his lips.\n\n“What invention are you talking about?”\n\nHis first captor exchanged a look with his companion.\n\n“Something that’s going to stand this country on its ear when it hears about it,” he answered. “The old man invented a mirror. He had one in the bureau in his bedroom. It’s a mirror that retains the reflection of the last person who passes before it.” …\n\nTHE END\n"

      "content_html": "For one of the few times since he had become an analyst, Doctor Kleist felt something very close to euphoria. He smiled at the woman across the desk from him, savoring this moment. It was one of the good times. It was times like these that keep a man from going back to the more profitable field of surgery. A complete recovery like this is one that made a grim profession worth while.\n\n“You’re certain, Doctor?” the woman asked, and there was an almost breathless pleasure in her voice.\n\nDoctor Kleist laughed. “Yes, Mrs. Clinton, I’m quite certain.”\n\n“And there’ll be no — recurrence?”\n\n“No. Kleptomania has been one of my specialties for a number of years, Mrs. Clinton. I feel, in all modesty, that I know more about it than almost any other analyst to whom you might have come.” He paused. “I’ve never been more certain of a complete recovery. And, Mrs. Clinton — I’ve never been made happier by one.”\n\nIt was true, he reflected. He’d grown quite fond of Mrs. Clinton, and of her husband, and he’d always remember them warmly. Her husband had brought her to this office ten months ago, a lovely, cultured woman in her early thirties, a woman wealthy in her own right and married to one of the city’s most successful corporation lawyers — and the thief of worthless baubles from dime stores and bargain counters. On the day before her husband had brought her here, Mrs. Clinton had been arrested for stealing a thirty-nine-cent compact. The magistrate had released her in her husband’s custody and recommended Doctor Kleist.\n\n“I’ll be forever grateful,” Mrs. Clinton said. “You don’t know how much —”\n\n“But I do,” Doctor Kleist said. “I do indeed. I think it’s been a very rewarding experience for all of us.”\n\n“I’m afraid I was pretty difficult to get along with. Doctor.”\n\nHe smiled. “Extremely.”\n\n“And uncooperative.”\n\n“That, too.”\n\nShe laughed softly and stood up. “I can scarcely wait to tell Walt. The poor darling, sometimes I think he’s endured even more with me than you have.”\n\n“Husbands often do,” Doctor Kleist said. “Especially someone like Walt. But that’s a thing of the past now. In a case like this, an analyst likes to feel he’s been responsible for not just one, but two recoveries. It’s a very pleasant feeling, I assure you.”\n\nHe came around the desk and walked with her to the door.\n\n“It’s almost like being … well, reborn,” Mrs. Clinton said.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“This will be the last time, of course,” he said. “The last time you’ll have to come here. But I hope you’ll drop in now and then. And bring Walt with you, if you can. I like to admire my handiwork.”\n\nFor a long moment after they had said goodbye, Doctor Kleist stood quite motionless before the door, listening to the sound of Mrs. Clinton’s high heels fading away in the direction of the elevator. Then he turned and walked slowly back to his desk and sat down in the deep leather chair.\n\nA wonderful woman, he thought, a truly wonderful woman. He envied her husband. A fine man, that Walt Clinton. He leaned back in the chair and closed his eyes, fantasying the way it would be with Walt at the moment his wife told him their mutual nightmare was over.\n\nThen, humming softly to himself, he drew a ruled yellow pad from a drawer and began the draft of a paper he wanted to read at the next congress of the Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis. He had, in Mrs. Clinton’s case, gained new insight into certain facets of kleptomania, and he was anxious to share them with his colleagues.\n\nHe had been working steadily for over an hour when the phone rang.\n\nHe lifted the phone absently, still writing rapidly.\n\n“Doctor Kleist.”\n\n“Hello, Doctor. This is Walt Clinton.”\n\nDoctor Kleist smiled and put down his pencil.\n\n“Well, Walt. How are you?”\n\nWalt, he was sure, had just received the good news and was calling to add his thanks to those of his wife.\n\n“Doctor, is my wife still there at your office?”\n\n“Why, no, Walt.” He glanced at his watch. “She left better than an hour ago.”\n\n“Oh, Well, I just wondered. She said she intended to come straight home. We had an engagement, and … well, never mind, Doctor. She probably forgot. Maybe she stopped off to do a little shopping.”\n\nHe laughed, a little thinly.\n\n“You know how women are.”\n\n“I know,” Doctor Kleist said. “She’ll be along soon, Walt.”\n\n“Sure. Well, I’m sorry I bothered you for nothing. Doctor.”\n\n“No bother at all,” Doctor Kleist said. For a moment he debated hinting to Walt that there was a bit of wonderful news coming his way, but decided against it. That should be Mrs. Clinton’s show.\n\nHe had scarcely replaced the phone in its cradle when it rang again.\n\nIt was Mrs. Clinton. “Something ridiculous has happened. Doctor Kleist . . .”\n\n“Really? What’s that?”\n\n“Well, I went several places before I came to your office this afternoon. I’ve just finished revisiting the last of them, and — this is really ridiculous — I thought I’d better call and — well, the thing is that I’ve lost my cigarette case somewhere. I didn’t use it while I was in your office, and I don’t think there’s much chance it could have fallen from my purse, but . . .”\n\n“I’m sorry,” Doctor Kleist said. “It isn’t here, Mrs. Clinton. You say you’ve gone back to the other places you visited?”\n\n“Yes. I just can’t imagine … It’s one Walt gave me on our anniversary, and that’s why it’s so important.”\n\n“There’s only one thing important today, Mrs. Clinton,” he said. “And that’s the news you have for Walt.”\n\nShe was silent a moment.\n\n“Yes. Yes, I guess you’re right. It is silly to let such a small thing … “\n\n“Of course it is.”\n\nHe said goodbye, put the phone down very gently, and then reached into his inside jacket pocket for the thin platinum case.\n\nIt was a shame he didn’t smoke, he reflected. But still, it would give him so much satisfaction, knowing it was there in his desk drawer with all the others.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

Is the boss in?” The inquirer was a young man in a soft felt hat and a discoloured raincoat, and the question was addressed to Tommy Burke, Dixon Hawke’s assistant.\n\nTommy was sitting at his desk in his employer’s office at the Dover Street chambers, and he surveyed the caller, a journalist friend of his, with interest.\n\n“No, Beverley. He’s week-ending out in the wilds.”\n\nBeverley’s face fell. “I’ve been asked to write a series of articles about uncanny experiences in crime detection, and I wondered if Mr. Hawke could help me.”\n\n“Detectives deal in hard, everyday facts,” stated Tommy. “They’re about the last people to apply to for uncanny experiences.”\n\n“I know. But I was hoping — “\n\nTommy suddenly rose from his chair.\n\n“Listen,” he said eagerly. “I think you’ve come to the right shop. What about the death of Walter Webster?”\n\n“You mean the writer of those books on the supernatural?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Hawke was on the case, wasn’t he?”\n\n“He was. And what’s more, the full story of it has never been told. Further, it’s the very story you are looking for, my lad. And, as it happens, I am the one person capable of telling it the way you want.”\n\nHe waved his arm towards a chair. His manner was impressive.\n\n“Sit down,” he said. “Help yourself to the guv’nor’s cigarettes, and wrap your ears round this.”\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nWebster lived with his wife in a lonely house near the village of Scorewell, pronounced Skorrel (said Tommy), and a more outlandish spot you never did see. It’s a thousand feet above sea level, and is in the wildest part of the Peak District. You know what it’s like. Hill and moor land, scattered with monstrous lumps of rock and deep ravines.\n\nThe house was called Mount Pleasant, and it was situated in what I thought was a pretty dangerous spot — near one of those ravines. There was only a rickety wire fence to prevent you going over in the dark.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Fortune-Teller\n\nWebster was a queer sort of bird — a mystic, y’know — and quite a contrast to his rather flash-looking wife. She was thirtyish, and he was about ten years older.\n\nThere came a time when Webster felt he was on the verge of staggering this world by clearing up the mysteries of the next. He went so far as to claim that he was about to settle the question of exactly what we can expect after death, and this caused excitement in the scientific world, because Webster was no mere charlatan, as you know. He stood high in the estimation of all who know what’s what, and what isn’t.\n\nHe rang up Professor Larcombe one night, in a fever of excitement, and announced that he was motoring to Morecambe, where lived a medium, the daughter of a farm-worker, who would enable him to prove his theories to the world. It was not merely a test, mind you. He claimed to have made all his tests. This was the Proof, with a capital “P.”\n\nHe set off on the long run, taking only a flask of tomato juice by way of refreshment. He was one of those birds who believe in keeping fit by scientific starvation.\n\nThere was a full moon, and it was one of those quiet, breezeless nights. I don’t know whether you’ve ever been in a mountainy district on a night like that. It’s queer. Everything seems twice its normal size, and the landscape’s all yellow and purple and grotesque and unnatural.\n\nThat’s how it was on that straight stretch of narrow, white road between a couple of beetling mountain sides, when Webster spotted a petrol-station — a forlorn-looking shack looked after by one man.\n\nWebster knew that his tank would want replenishing before long, so he pulled up.\n\nThe petrol-man was a cheerful sort of cove named Brown. The guv’nor and I interviewed him afterwards, and it’s from him that I got this part of the story.\n\nAfter telling Brown to fill her up, Webster asked if his petrol station was on the phone, and Brown said it was. The place, in fact, was quite civilised, for there was a post-box there as well.\n\nWebster got out of the car, went inside the hut, and put through a call.\n\nWhen he came out, Brown was putting the petrol-pipe back on its hook and on the opposite side of the roadway was a gipsy caravan, with a bony, dispirited-looking horse between the shafts.\n\nBrown saw Webster staring, and he turned. He afterwards told the guv’nor that he got quite a start, for he had neither seen nor heard the thing approaching, although there are no bends in the road for several hundred yards.\n\nSitting up in front of the caravan, holding the reins, was a tall bloke wearing a wide-brimmed felt hat with a high crown. I remember I was sort of impressed with old Brown’s description of that hat, and I can picture it quite well. These gypsies don’t bother to dent ‘em in like trilbies. It was not quite of the sugar-loaf variety, but rather like a trilby run to seed.\n\nThe fellow’s face was completely in the shadow, and Brown never glimpsed his features at all.\n\nBy his side was the oldest-looking woman Brown had ever seen.\n\nShe had a gaudy ‘kerchief bound closely round her head, and this seemed to emphasise the bird-like qualities of her shrivelled old face. Her nose was like a vulture’s beak, and the moonbeams caught the whites of her eyes, so as to give them a baleful, unearthly appearance.\n\nThe old woman turned and looked at the two men, but the man by her aide looked neither to right nor to left.\n\nSlowly and laboriously the old woman climbed down from the caravan and approached Webster.\n\n“Tell your fortune?” she croaked. “Cross my hand with silver.”\n\nBrown told us that, in a way, it was a whining plea, and yet there was something compelling about it — as though she offered Webster no alternative but to cross her hand with silver and have his fortune told.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Curious Experience\n\nWebster chuckled, but seemed a little bit uneasy. Brown, too, had a vague feeling of that sort.\n\n“It’s funny,” Webster remarked, “but I feel I have met you before —  years and years ago. So many years that I can’t remember. All right, my good woman. Here’s half-a-crown. Will you tell my fortune for that?”\n\nThe old woman took the money, and, beckoning him to follow, went to the back of the caravan, pulled down the wooden steps, and climbed up inside. Webster followed.\n\nBrown, whose curiosity was all worked up, strolled round to the back and glanced in. The door was open, and the moon shone in, slantwise, so as to light up the interior sufficiently for him to see the gipsy woman sitting on one side of a table gazing into a crystal, and Webster sitting on the other side watching her.\n\nBrown strolled back and stood leaning against a petrol-pump, and after a minute Webster came out of the caravan holding a sealed envelope.\n\n“Well,” asked Brown, as the old woman climbed back up beside the driver, and Webster moved away from the caravan, “what’s your fortune, sir?”\n\n“I asked her whether it was good or bad,” answered Webster, smiling faintly, “and she said I might be inclined to think it bad. So I said — ‘I’m off on an important mission which won’t fail —  which mustn’t fail — so I don’t propose troubling my head with thoughts of bad fortune. Write it down, and stick it in this envelope. I’ll read it later. He was about to put the letter in his pocket when his eye alighted on the posting-box, and he was struck with a sudden whim.\n\n“I’ll address it to myself,” he said, “and post it.”\n\nHe took out a fountain pen and wrote the address of a Morecambe hotel, which Brown was afterwards able to recall. Then he took a stamp out of his wallet, and dropped the letter into the box.\n\n“I had a very curious experience in that caravan,” he said, after a thoughtful pause. “I don’t know. I suppose it was just my fancy, but somehow I felt that the interior was all familiar. And that old woman — “\n\n“She’s a rum ‘un,” agreed Brown.\n\n“Although she had her face down,” went on Webster, “I had the uncomfortable feeling that she was staring at me all the time. It was as though she had wide-open, penetrating eyes in the top of her head.”\n\n“Funny ‘ow nerves can play you up, sir. Crumbs, sir! That thing’s made good going, sir. It’s gone.”\n\nThey both stared down the road, but there was no sign of the caravan. The horse had only been crawling along, and it seemed impossible that it should have travelled out of sight in that short space. They could only conclude that, being engrossed in conversation, they had lost track of the time.\n\nWebster paid for his petrol and got back in his car.\n\n“I’ve got some coffee,” said Brown, “if you want any refreshment before you carry on.”\n\n“No, thanks,” said Webster, “I have some tomato juice.”\n\nHe took a pull at the flask which he produced from the pocket of his car, nodded good-bye to Brown, and started away.\n\nNow we come to the real substance of the story.\n\nWebster had gone about a couple of miles down the road when his car hit the stone parapet of a bridge and hurtled over into a stream. He was killed, and his car was completely wrecked.\n\nHis great discovery was lost to the world.\n\nThe police thought that something might have gone wrong with the steering and they inquired at Brown’s petrol station. In the course of the interview Brown mentioned the gypsies, but expressed the opinion that they had had no chance of interfering with the car. Anyway, the police failed to trace the gypsies. You never can. They move about all the time, and you can’t tell one from the other.\n\nThe guv’nor came into the case in the ordinary course of duty in the service of an insurance company that pays him a retaining fee. Webster’s life had only recently been insured, and the fatality set the company back ten thousand of the best. Mrs. Webster was the beneficiary.\n\nWe both went along to that lonely stretch of road, arriving there before Webster’s car tracks had been obliterated by other vehicles.\n\nWe traced them on foot from Brown’s petrol station to the bridge where the accident occurred, and found that for the first half-mile they went straight and clean along the centre of the road. Then they jerked suddenly to the side, and there were skid-marks, as though the driver had suddenly tried to dodge something.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nAn Awkward Interview\n\nThe guv’nor spent some time searching about the road at this point.\n\n“That’s odd,” he remarked to me, “there’s no sign of any other vehicle which might have occasioned this sudden swerve.”\n\nThe tracks were wobbly for another half-mile, and were close in to the side of the road — so close that, in places, only the tracks of the offside wheels could be seen.\n\n“Something seems to have been squeezing him in,” I remarked, “but I don’t see any tracks.”\n\nWe came to a bend, and there Webster’s tracks crossed over to the wrong side of the road, and continued there for several hundred yards. Back they came again, and, for the next mile before we reached the bridge they followed a fairly even course along the middle of the road once more. Just in front of the bridge they veered suddenly to the left, and there were several stones missing from the parapet.\n\nAfter that the guv’nor inspected the wrecked car, which had been taken to a garage in the nearest village — and, my! how he inspected it!\n\nFrankly, old man, it’s a little bit embarrassing to be with him sometimes, because he doesn’t care two hoots about people thinking him ridiculous. There was a smirking police inspector making sarcastic remarks to the garage manager, while the guv’nor examined every square inch of that car through a magnifying glass. When he pulled Webster’s task of tomato juice from the pocket and asked to be allowed to take it away, there were undisguised jeers.\n\nWe drove back and had a long talk with Brown.\n\nThe guv nor was intrigued by his story of the gipsy — unreasonably so, it seemed to me. To be quite honest, I was a little irritated with him when he sent me to Morecambe to retrieve the letter winch Webster had posted to himself.\n\nMy irritation was justified, because the trip was quite unnecessary. The letter had no bearing at all on our inquiry. But that’s how it is with him at times. It’s the eccentricity of genius, old man.\n\nWhen I got back to the village inn at Scorewell, where we were staying, I found him in the sitting room examining some of his own visiting cards under a pocket microscope. No, that wasn’t eccentricity. They weren’t ordinary cards. They’re kept for a special purpose. The surface is treated with a sensitive solution, and, when you want somebody’s fingerprints on the sly, you hand him a card and then make an excuse to get it back. Tell him it’s your last one. Or else, if he puts it on his hallstand, which he generally does, retrieve it surreptitiously.\n\nThe tomato juice flask stood on the table in front of him. It was covered with a black powder, and clusters of fingerprints were discernible on it. The stopper was off, and it lay amidst a collection of saucers and bottles containing chemical reagents.\n\nI was about to question the guv’nor as to the meaning of if all, when he happened to glance out of the window.\n\nA passer-by in the village street was the object of his attention.\n\nI followed the direction of his pointing finger, and saw a big man striding along, glaring at the ground as though he dared it to give way beneath his feet.\n\n“That’s Mr. Reginald Sellers, Tommy. It would be difficult to find anyone who dislikes me more than he does.”\n\n“Who is he anyway?”\n\n“A friend of Mrs. Webster’s. He’s a guest just at the moment at Mount Pleasant.”\n\n“Oh,” I said, noting the curious, grim way in which the guv’nor watched the passing figure. “Oh — oh! In fact — oh!”\n\n“I called at Mount Pleasant to ask Mrs. Webster a few formal questions,” the guv nor went on, “and she insisted on her friend, Mr. Sellers, being present during the interview. She seemed reluctant to answer my questions, and Mr. Sellers was frankly resentful of my presence.\n\n“I shall call back there this evening,” he added, “to ask further questions, and I imagine their resentment this time will be infinitely greater.”\n\nAs is often the case — I suppose I’m slow-witted — I suddenly realised that we were in the midst of something fishy which the guv’nor had sensed some time beforehand.\n\nI thought about those car tracks and about the guvnor’s fierce attack on the case — on all fronts, as it were. I realised that he had sent me to Morecambe simply because he became suddenly keen to lay hold of every tiny fact connected with the case, however remotely.\n\nI produced the letter, but, as I say, it didn’t have any bearing on our investigations.\n\nThe guv’nor was intent upon dealing with the very material matter on hand, and this seemed no occasion for worrying about fortune-tellers.\n\nIt was getting dark, and there was a stiffish wind blowing up when I got the car out of the pub garage. The guv’nor got in beside me, and we set off up the steep, winding road which led to the Webster home.\n\nThe guv’nor was very preoccupied, and several of the questions I asked him went unanswered.\n\nThe breeze grew stronger, and the night grew darker. I shall never forget it. When it’s stormy in that district, you hear a kind of moaning and whistling, as the wind cuts round the crags.\n\n“Wait out here for me,” said the guv’nor, when we finally pulled up. “You can get the car turned round. It’s not improbable that our next call will be at the police station.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nTommy “Listens In”\n\nWe had drawn up outside the house and were looking over that ravine which runs up by the side of the garden. As you near the top of that road, you get the impression that you are driving over the edge to your doom.\n\nHaving turned the car round and put the brakes on, I sat there for a few seconds and then began to think things too tame.\n\nThere was a light from one of the down-stairs windows facing me, and, the curtain not being drawn, I could see into the room.\n\nI saw Mr. Sellers pass across and stand by the fireplace, and I also caught a glimpse of Mrs. Webster.\n\nThey were looking towards the doorway, where, I gathered, the guv’nor was standing, and, as the windows, which were of the casement type, were partly open I guessed it would be possible to hear what was going on if one were close enough.\n\nI proceeded to disobey orders, and was presently standing outside a window, eavesdropping.\n\n“You say, Mrs. Webster, that you have never, on any occasion, touched the task in which your husband carried his tomato juice,” said the guv’nor.\n\n“That’s what she said,” snapped Sellers; “can’t you take her word for it? And, besides, what’s the flask got to do with the accident?”\n\n“Perhaps Mrs. Webster can explain how her finger-prints come to be on the flask at the present moment.”\n\nThere was a half-stifled cry from the woman, and Sellers broke in with an angry shout.\n\n“What is all this stuff and nonsense? How can you know whether her fingerprints are on it?”\n\n“I secured an impression of them on a specially-prepared visiting-card.”\n\n“You did? Pretty low, despicable sort of business yours, isn’t it?”\n\n“No. My business is to deal with low and despicable actions, such as insurance fraud and murder.”\n\nThe woman shrieked.\n\n“Murder! What do you mean?” yelled the man crazily.\n\n“Frankly, I think Webster was murdered. I have made a test of the dregs of tomato juice, and I shall request the police surgeon to be on the lookout for evidence of strychnine poisoning when he makes the autopsy. Goodnight.”\n\nI turned and nipped back down the path and got in the car, feverishly figuring it all out. if you try to do the same, Beverley, you’ll see it was a dashed ingenious idea. Strychnine poisoning causes convulsions, and is easy to detect, provided you happen to be looking for it.\n\nBut are you likely to look for it when making a post-mortem examination of a mangled corpse — the obvious victim of a car crash?\n\nThe convulsions rendered the man at the wheel helpless. Probably his leg stiffened so that his foot pressed down on the accelerator, and all he could do would be to hang on to the wheel like a drowning man clutching a straw. They must have visualised all that — and also the possibility of the car catching fire after the crash, so that all evidence of the real cause of death would be destroyed.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA Murderous Attack\n\nI sat behind the wheel for a moment or two, and as the guv’nor didn’t come I opened the door and looked up the path.\n\nWhat I saw gave me the prize scare of the century.\n\nSellers had followed the guv’nor and pounced on him, thinking to hurl him over the ravine. I ought to have been on the lookout for some such move, and so, for that matter, ought the guv’nor. He was the one man who stood between them and their continued existence, and — well, people do sometimes fall into ravines in that district; it would have been fairly easy to pass the guv’nor’s death off as an accident in the dark.\n\nThere were two things that Sellers hadn’t allowed for. One was the possibility of the guv’nor having somebody with him, and the other was the possibility of the guv’nor having the strength of about two ordinary men.\n\nSellers was half a head taller than the guv’nor, and nearly a couple of stone heavier, but he was having a mighty rough time of it. They had both crashed through the fence and were struggling on the sloping, slippery ground which fell away to the cliff edge.\n\nJust for a second I stood holding my breath, for there seemed nothing to prevent the pair of ‘em going over.\n\nThen I got possession of myself again and I whipped back the car seat and seized a big spanner.\n\nI stood over the struggling pair, and when Sellers came uppermost I brought the spanner into play to perform its natural function. I loosened his nut for him!\n\nHe would have gone bowling over the edge, his dead weight dragging the guv’nor along, too, but I managed to grab one of his ankles and dig my heels into the ground.\n\nThe guv’nor scrambled to his feet and we got the unconscious bloke’s hands tied behind him.\n\nAfter some little thought we decided that it was our duty to take the pair of ‘em to the police station in our car. But the little drama was not yet played out.\n\nWhen he went back into the house the guv’nor found Mrs. Webster lying on the floor groaning.\n\nShe had taken the strychnine that had been left over, and there was nothing we could do. She died in a very short space of time.\n\nI needn’t trouble you with the rest of the details of our night’s work, except to say that Mrs. Webster had scribbled a last frantic note on the telephone pad. It said: “The insurance was Mr. Sellers’ idea. He made me do it. Heaven forgive me.”\n\nLater a chemist, who saw Sellers’ photo in the paper, identified him as a man who had bought strychnine from him, signing some other name in the poison register.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nThe Pencilled Message\n\nThe journalist had listened to this story with close interest, and as the young detective sat back and regarded him quizzically from under lowered lids, he frowned in perplexity.\n\n“But,” he said, “where does the gipsy come into it?”\n\n“Nowhere — so far as we are concerned,” grinned Tommy.\n\nBeverley showed signs of irritation.\n\n“I don’t quite get you. I can see that Hawke first got on to the scent when he saw those skid marks on the road. He realised that the driver had suddenly been taken ill in the car and he began searching for the cause of the illness. I don’t see what the gipsy had got to do with it.”\n\n“Neither do I.”\n\n“What are you driving at?”\n\n“The guv’nor didn’t have to concern himself with the gipsy. He’d done his job. He’d uncovered an insurance fraud and caught out a couple of murderers. He’s a criminologist, not a necromancer.”\n\n“What about the gipsy’s note? You say that had no bearing on the case.”\n\n“What I’ve told you, old man, is a matter-of-fact, materialistic crime story. That, for us, is the beginning and end of it. What you’re after is the Uncanny Experience aspect of it. You must give the gipsy a good write-up.”\n\nThe exasperated reporter, conscious that Tommy was deliberately holding something back, at last hit on the vital question.\n\n“What was in the confounded letter?”\n\n“Ah! I’ve often wondered if the materialistic part of the story would have been any different if Webster had read it at the petrol-station. Whether that devastating secret of his would have been revealed to the world — “\n\n“What was in the letter?”\n\n“We never traced the gipsy, of course, and — “\n\n“I’ll give you one more chance,” said Beverley, beginning to pull off his coat, “before we make a rough-house of it. What was in the letter?”\n\n“The envelope contained a half sheet of notepaper, and on it was a pencilled message in block capitals. The message was: ‘YOU WILL NOT LIVE TO REACH YOUR DESTINATION.’”\n\n~THE END~\n"

It wasn’t new enough to be noticeable, nor was it shabby. It showed signs of use, and it was lettered with a business-like and ambiguous company name. Eureka Distributing Company.\n\nIt came wheeling out of an alleyway between two dark warehouses, running without lights, and Johnny Packer had to climb a curb to avoid a crash. Then he caught the tinny clamor of an alarm ringing inside one of the warehouses. The panel was nearly to the corner, doing maybe forty-five per, and picking up speed.\n\n“Well,” said Johnny softly, “what do you know when he reefed the coupe off the curb and tramped down on the accelerator.\n\nThis could be the break he needed. Because, of all the lunatic coincidences, this was Johnny’s assignment of the moment. For thirty days he had been battering his stubborn head against this business of the warehouse thieves.\n\nHe was a good cop, Johnny Packer. He came from the wrong side of town, to begin with, and he came up the hard way. He pounded a beat, and he drove a patrol car. He worked hard, and he got a few breaks, and he made the plainclothes division. He was a good cop, and the worst part of the job was the all-too-many times he had to bring in one of the boys he’d grown up with, over on the wrong side of town … .\n\nThe panel job took the next corner on screeching rubber, and by the time Johnny had the coupe around it, he could see that the panel truck had lights now. Smart again. Even on this quiet street at this time of night, a car without lights would be noticed.\n\nThree blocks straight ahead the panel went, and then made a tight, noisy left turn. Johnny followed, wincing a little at the squeal of his tires. The panel was really rolling now, and had gained nearly half a block on him. They’d spotted his lights, obviously, for they wheeled into the next turn without the least slackening.\n\n“Well, all right,” he said to himself, and clamped his stubborn jaw as he juggled the wheel into the tight turn.\n\nHe’d had a hunch about this business — well, maybe not so much a hunch as a shrewd bit of reasoning. This would be Squeaky Antle’s type racket. He knew Squeaky from way back, from the time they’d grown, up and fought together back in the old neighborhood.\n\nSqueaky was always the smart guy. Shooting the angles, playing the wise money. Smart enough to have done pretty well if he’d wanted to play it legit; half smart, Johnny always figured, because Squeaky wanted no part of the legit. That was for the suckers. Of course, it made a good front, which was why Squeaky owned a piece of a crummy amusement park with his brother-in-law.\n\nThere’d been the little touches. Warehouse watchmen were conveniently absent, or asleep, when a job was pulled. Alarms failed to work. One watchman who went to the lavatory found himself locked in, without seeing who did it, and it was half an hour before he thought about shooting the lock out.\n\nLittle touches like this panel truck now, with its innocuous lettering and its air of respectable usage.\n\nJohnny Packer made no attempt to keep his distance now that he was sure that they knew he was tailing them. He tooled the coupe with the touch he’d learned on the patrol car. There are ways of pinching off a car, if your nerve and skill holds. At fifty miles per, it takes nerve, too.\n\nAt that, he was almost suckered. The tail light on the panel flared up as the driver hit the brakes, and the nose slewed for a narrow alleyway.\n\nJohnny wasn’t ready. He knew in that split second he couldn’t possibly make it, and he growled deep in his throat and yanked the wheel over, hard. He stabbed the brakes as he reefed the wheel, and he threw the coupe into a deliberate, fast broadslide. He threw himself sidelong on the seat at the last possible instant, and then they hit, in a jarring crash of smashing fenders. That hurt. This was his private car, and a plainclothesman’s pay won’t buy many fenders.\n\nThen he clawed open the door and hit the pavement, crouching low as he came around the turtleback of the coupe.\n\n“All right,” he said sharply, and he brought the Police Positive .38 out from under his arm. “Hold it right there!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Shoot Out\n\nA black little .32 made a loud, unpleasant crash almost in his face, and he hit the ground rolling. The flash was blinding, and little flaring saucers dotted his vision. But he’d filled his hunch. That was Squeaky Antle’s face behind the gun.\n\nJohnny’s own shot tore the night apart as he rolled, and he heard the spiteful slap the lead made on the door of the panel. Then he heard the pound of feet in the alleyway. He rolled on to the nose of the panel, got his knees under him and fired again. He got a short frightened yell and a crash as one of them went down. Then the man screamed and screamed and screamed.\n\nJohnny said sharply around the radiator of the panel, “Throw the rod away.”\n\n“I dropped it,” the man howled. “Geez, I’m hit! I’m hit bad! I quit — don’t shoot no more!”\n\nJohnny risked the flashlight then, holding it at full arm’s length. His man was down, and one leg was spreading a puddle below the knee. His gun was lying three feet away.\n\nJohnny kicked the gun back toward the panel and took a quick look around. Then he dragged the man a couple of feet and cuffed one arm to a barred basement window. He cursed the time it took, for the running sound of Squeaky’s feet was only a faint murmur at the far end of the alley.\n\n“You’ll be all right,” he retorted shortly to his man’s protesting squealing. “There’ll be someone to check on this shooting in a few minutes.”\n\nHe took the alleyway at a driving run, the urgency of finishing this tingling inside him. He knew Squeaky. Let him get clear, even for an hour, and he’d have an iron-clad alibi. He’d make a point of meeting Johnny later. And he’d grin, that tough wise grin of his, and maybe he’d put into words what his mocking eyes were saying.\n\n“Dumb flatfoot. Half smart, you call me.” And then he’d laugh. “What does that make you, flatfoot? I suckered you and where does that leave you?”\n\nHe came to the end of the alley, and he deliberately let his feet slap hard on the asphalt. He slid to a stop just at the angle of the wall that marked the corner.\n\nInstantly the .32 lashed out from the side. The bullet spat brick dust from the wall, and then took up a high scream as it somersaulted out over the rooftops. Johnny let loose a return shot and heard his own bullet smack deep into the bricks across the way. Then he could hear Squeaky’s scuffling flight again.\n\nHe turned the corner, crouching, and he took perhaps half a dozen running steps. Then the .32 blinked brightly at him again, and something took him by the arm and flung him against the wall. He leaned there, numb and vaguely sick, and suddenly very, very tired. Then the pain came, and it woke him up, sharp and demanding.\n\n“Bull-headed,” some said of Johnny; and “Tough flatfoot,” said some. Stubborn, he was, and a good cop, and now he shook his head and set his square chin, and again he pounded after Squeaky.\n\nHe knew where Squeaky was heading now. It was only a block to Squeaky’s amusement park, and Squeaky could melt into a dozen hiding places there. A few minutes would be enough. By then he’d have ditched the gun, have a drink or two under his belt, and be sitting in a friendly poker game — where he’d been for hours. With witnesses. Johnny lengthened his stride.\n\nThere was a gate, and then a flimsy door. The whole place was dark. Johnny tested the door and then lunged into it with his right shoulder. Something gave, and he crashed through.\n\nDark. Black as pitch. Black as hell. And quiet. The loose flooring sighed gently under his feet, and it was the only sound in the building. But Squeaky was there. Somehow, he knew that Squeaky was there, and so was his flat little .32, and it was a damned uncomfortable sensation.\n\nHe stood stock still for a moment, his ears alert to catch the faintest of sounds, but nothing came. He sidled up the hall, keeping close to the wall, but even here the boards whispered and sighed under his feet.\n\nAnother door, and a sudden turn to the wall, and he stopped and cocked his head again. He thought of the flashlight in his hip pocket, but his right hand was filled with the Police Positive, and his whole left arm was a great jumping toothache. He felt a little budding of sweat on his forehead. Squeaky was in here.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Distorted Reflection\n\nSuddenly, blindingly, light burst all around him. Not ten feet away, facing him, was a ten-foot giant, a grotesque figure with a barrel chest and pipe-stem legs and an ape’s face, pointing a gun the size of a jug at him. He almost fired, before he saw what it was.\n\nIt was his own reflection in a distorted mirror. They were all about him, making crazy senseless angles of the room. At the same instant, he heard the door click shut — a chilly sound, like the click of handcuffs, or the clack of a sprung trap.\n\nHe swung around quickly. Nothing but more mirrors. No sense, no sane regularity to anything. Just his own reflection, peering at him from a dozen crazy angles, twisted, nightmarish. There was no door, any more.\n\nThen he heard Squeaky’s voice. Like the mirrors, it was unreal, distorted by the hidden microphone that fed the speaker somewhere over head.\n\n“All right,” Squeaky said, and some of the gasping from his hard run came through.\n\n“All right, you dumb flatfoot. You’re smart, you think. Well you’re not. You’re dumb — and you’re dead, you dumb, lard-headed flattie!”\n\nHis voice took on a pointed jeering.\n\n“Come and get me, flatfoot! I’m right over here. No, wrong way, copper!” The speaker made flat jarring little sounds of laughter.\n\n“I can see you, Johnny Packer. And I’m going to kill you. But you don’t know from where. Front, back, side — you don’t know where I am, do you, flatfoot?”\n\nAgain he laughed his jarring little laugh.\n\nJohnny turned slowly on his heel, the .38 ready in his right hand. And, the sweat popped afresh on his forehead.\n\nThere was nothing. Just himself. Fat, over yonder, not over four feet tall, and nearly as wide. Tall again, there, but with legs that slanted to the side. Clubfooted, here, with shoulders resting on his hips and a neck three feet long, and a wide silly smile.\n\nIn the corner, a nightmare version of the tailor’s pier-glass. In the center, himself, stocky, solid, crouching a little, with a bloody sleeve and a bulldog set to his jaw. To the left, a scrawny beanpole caricature, and on the right, a squat disdainful dwarf.\n\nHis eyes caught there, and then he made them go on, and he made a slow turn on his heels, and he let his lips sag away from his teeth for a few seconds.\n\n“Better give up, Squeaky,” he said aloud, and even to himself his voice was dull and hopeless. Squeaky laughed.\n\n“Sweat, damn you!” he rasped savagely. “It won’t be for long.”\n\n“There’ll be cops here in a minute,” retorted Johnny desperately.\n\n“You won’t tell ‘em nothing, flatfoot.”\n\nEasy, said Johnny Packer to himself. Relax. Keep him talking. Don’t look too long at any one spot. Keep moving. He suddenly felt a crawling spot between his shoulder blades.\n\nSqueaky’s voice was tightening. He was screwing himself up to killing pitch, and it showed in his voice.\n\n“All right, flatfoot,” came his rasp, “get ready to take it!”\n\nThe slick metallic sound of the safety catch being clicked off came over the speaker.\n\nJohnny croaked wordlessly, and backed up, letting the panic show on his face, and his eyes rolled wildly from side to side. Then quite suddenly, he swung the Police Positive in a short, quarter-arc and pumped his last three shots into the corner where the three mirrors angled together.\n\nThe speaker squawked hoarsely, and then set up a penetrating buzz. Glass jingled musically to the floor, and then Squeaky Antle came through, rolling forward as he hunched his shoulders and hugged both arms to his belly. He crashed down amid the mirror fragments, and kicked twice. Then he was dead.\n\nJohnny Packer told it to his chief, in his verbal report:\n\n“Like I always claimed, Squeaky was only half smart. He had me sewed up in a sack, and ready to dump, but he had to brag a little. I figured he had to be behind a two-way mirror. You know, one of those trick things you can see through from the back, while the guy in front only sees his reflection.”\n\nThe chief nodded.\n\n“Well, I had time to take a good gander. I turned clear around, and I looked at every mirror in the room. That one in the corner was the only one that didn’t make a monkey out of me. In it, I looked natural. So that’s the one I shot up. A little rough on Squeaky.”\n\n“Johnny,” said the chief, “you’re a good cop.”\n\n“Just half smart,” said Johnny modestly.\n\nTHE END\n"

A man my age seldom sleeps well. Captain Emery’s raving and groaning in the next room kept me awake. But I couldn’t understand a word he said. Maybe there were no words, maybe they were foreign. The man had traveled and studied a lot.\n\nI finally dozed off, but a while later a scream woke me up. I propped myself on my elbow and looked out. The moon was high over the sea, and lighted our grounds brightly. Near the park wall a girl was running — running fast.\n\nShe screamed again. Not so loud this time. Perhaps she didn’t want to wake up the “Home,” or maybe she was so frightened her throat was tight. I couldn’t say. But right away I found an explanation. That girl must be the new gatekeeper’s wife. The fellow must have been drinking again, and was chasing her.\n\nShe disappeared behind the lilacs then, and I would have forgotten all about it, except that all at once I thought I saw a head with a pair of short, curved horns floating over a bush. After that something awfully low and broad streaked after her across an open space.\n\nFunny, the way those shadows will take queer shapes at night, I told myself, and waited for her to show up from around the shrubbery. But she never did. The gatekeeper must have caught up with her, I decided, and had taken her back to his house.\n\nBut the memory of those “shadows” kept me thinking. If it weren’t for my bum leg I’d have got up to take a look, but I couldn’t. And I didn’t feel like waking anybody else, just to make a fool of myself by butting in on a family squabble. I finally fell asleep.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Gatekeeper’s Wife\n\nIn the morning Yorgo Sarafoglou came to help me up. That leg of mine where a shark had stripped some muscle is all right once I’m on it, but getting up by myself is impossible.\n\n“Did you hear anything queer last night, Yorgo?” I asked him.\n\n“If you mean Captain Emery’s raving, Captain Williams, I sure did. Couldn’t understand any of it though, except the name of a woman he kept repeating. Sounded Greek to me.”\n\nI thought Yorgo was joking, seeing how he’s Greek himself, and I meant to tell him a dying man’s a poor joke. But what kind of humor can you expect from a man who’s been a cook on a sponging schooner? “Calm Bay Home” for disabled sailors disregards former rankings. We got to tolerate each other. Besides, Yorgo had seemed dead serious when he said it.\n\n“There’s something else,” he added, dusting off my uniform with his one good arm. “I’m not supposed to tell you, but you’d find out anyway. There’s been a murder. The gatekeeper’s wife.”\n\n“The gatekeeper’s done it,” I said with conviction.\n\n“Nope, Captain Williams. The guy was drinking with the janitor and the cook when it happened. Perfect alibi. Besides, a man didn’t kill her. No man could have — like that.”\n\n“What do you mean?” I said, and something cold began to crawl up my spine.\n\n“She’s horribly ripped to shreds. Ripped by animal tusks. A big animal, the policeman said, after he covered her up. The tusks were no less than three inches long, and sharp. Not even the cap could guess what it might’ve been. And there are queer prints we found on the path and the beach. Cloven feet, Captain. As I live and breathe. Real big ones.”\n\nHe looked at me sort of confidentially.\n\n“You suppose the Sea Devil come back? I’ve heard — “\n\n“Sea Devil, my eye!”\n\nI hobbled past him to the refectory. I meant to tell Commissioner Guire of what I’d seen in the night, and I wanted to ask Doc Gillen how Emery was. But Guire was out, probably with the police, and Doc Gillen started talking before I could ask him anything.\n\n“You’re a pretty good friend of Emery’s, Captain Williams,” he said. “You should call on him.”\n\n“Is he any better, Doc?”\n\nRight away I knew that was a dumb question. How can you expect a man to get better when he’s eighty, and sclerosis plugs his veins up with lime, till his legs get to swelling bigger and bigger, and he’s too weak to stand an operation?\n\nThe doc shook his head.\n\n“You may cheer him up a bit, now that he’s conscious. Try it, anyway.”\n\nI figured what I had to tell the commissioner would keep, while Emery maybe wouldn’t. So I got Captain Gustafson — at Calm Bay we’re all captains — to come with me to see the sick man.\n\nWe didn’t know it then, but Doc Gillen had been wrong. Emery wasn’t conscious. He couldn’t have been, judging by the crazy yarn he told us. At least, that’s what Gustafson thinks. I’m not so sure.\n\nWhen we came in Miss Stenger, the nurse, was propping Emery’s shrunken body in the hammock bed he’d woven himself. His eyes were closed as always, for he was blind.\n\nOnly today the scars over his lids and sockets stood out red and ugly with fever.\n\n“Morning, Captain Williams — how are you, Captain Gustafson?” he greeted us weakly.\n\nIt gave me the creeps to think that this blind man could tell us from six hundred others by our tread only. I hobbled to a chair where his blue uniform with foul-anchor buttons was hanging. Gustafson cupped his big hands where his ears used to be, one ripped off by a Spanish bullet at Manila, the other by a yataghan on the Mediterranean. He would hear a bit better this way, but not too good.\n\nI tried to think of something cheerful, to say.\n\n“Understand you was having dreams last night, Captain Emery. Talking with a lady friend most of the time.”\n\nI had to say it loud for Gustafson’s sake, and because the sea was beating hard at the cliffs right past Emery’s window.\n\nThe sick man jerked up. And all at once I knew it was the wrong thing to say. His thin hands started shaking all over the hammock cover of his own scrimshaw work.\n\n“A lady!” he screeched, and there was something queer, birdlike in his voice. “Did I call her? What was her name? No! No! For God’s sake, don’t say it! Don’t ever mention it!”\n\nMiss Stenger came toward him, but he was already quiet. His head slipped down on the pillow, and now I saw how his face had swollen overnight, making his small hooked nose look even smaller, sharper. Like a beak.\n\n“It’s over,” he whispered. “All over. Give me death. Quick, clean death. Before she — “\n\nThe sea drowned the rest. The sea that had maimed us, and cast us like useless jetsam here into Calm Bay, was still reaching for us, trying to destroy us.\n\n“Don’t ever mention her, men,” Emery moaned. “Don’t ever call her name. If you do, she’ll come, and you … But you won’t. Not after I tell you about her. You won’t dare then.”\n\nHe paused, as if listening to the sea, or to Miss Stenger’s even breathing\n\nfrom the arm-chair. She was asleep there already after the night’s vigil. He started to talk, then. And this is the story he told …\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Captain’s Tale\n\nI was on the Principessa, under Captain Noregard. It doesn’t matter how I got on her. I’ve been a lot of places since I ran away from the divinity school in Boston. Too much Latin, too much Greek in school for me. Out I went, and kept going till I found myself on the Principessa.\n\nShe flew the Rumanian flag and had a steady run between Constantinople and Piraeus in Greece, and what she carried for cargo only her captain knew. You’d see him bring on a small box in the Golden Horn at Constantinople. Then we’d nose her through the Marmora and the Dardanelles into the Aegean.\n\nIn Piraeus he’d walk off the ship with that box. That was all. I used to wonder about it. Smuggled jewelry, opium — you couldn’t tell. But I got paid well for tending the steam engine. That was one of the first steam engines on those waters.\n\nEverything went smoothly till one spring night a Turkish coast guard took after us. A funny hybrid, with one stack and three masts. Maybe she could have caught us, maybe not. Anyway, she fired a four-pounder across our bow.\n\nNoregard yelled for full speed ahead and turned south. A cold wind was blowing in from the Black Sea, chasing up thick yellow fog. You know how many islands there are in the south Aegean. We could have hidden among them from the whole British fleet, except that after awhile the coast guard fired again — a lucky shot. We didn’t have time enough to find out if it was our boiler explosion that killed most of the crew, or if the shell did. There wasn’t time to think.\n\nWe took to the life-boat, all that was left of us. Captain Noregard, a Greek stoker, a fat Turk who kept counting amber beads and mumbling, an Armenian about as young as I was, but taller, and myself. The Greek and I took the first shift at the oars. The skipper was at the helm, but you could tell he didn’t know where he was going and didn’t care as long as he got away from the coast guard.\n\nAll night we rowed, bailing out what the waves splashed in over the gunwales. By morning we saw the island. It wasn’t big. Mostly green, coppery rock and, like on all of them, some Judas trees in bloom, and wild grapes beyond the beach.\n\n“What place is this?” I asked.\n\nNoregard couldn’t tell, but just then we turned a small peninsula, and the Greek stoker got up, his hairy hand pointed at something on the shore, and it seemed as if his face turned to ice suddenly, so white and blue it got. I looked where he pointed. There wasn’t much to see. A tiny chapel hewed right in the rock, small columns, steps, and all. You could see such columns, only bigger, lying all over the Acropolis, and the Aegean islands are full of old Greek shrines.\n\nJust then the Greek began to screech:\n\n“Not here, Captain! Turn back! Don’t land here!”\n\nThat was darn queer, asking us to turn back to the coast guard, and the sea that was swelling. And us with neither food nor water.\n\n“Sit down, Nick,” the captain said.\n\nBut it was plain that the Greek was out of his head. He jumped at Noregard and tried to tear him away from the rudder. And all the time he was yelling, “Turn back!” and looking at the shrine.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nShe\n\nNoregard tried to push him off, but you can’t argue with insanity. The third time Nick came up at the captain, the captain’s gun came up faster. The Greek splashed backward into a wave. His head bobbed up once. I’d expected him to scream or beg or fight, but that big face of his was smiling.\n\nHe said, “Thanks, Captain,” and went under for good.\n\nWe landed right after that. Not by the shrine, but farther toward the village that showed up, stuck to the cliffs. The people who lived there must have heard Noregard’s shot, for men were piling out, and then we knew we were in for it.\n\nLazzes, every last one of them, descendants of the Levantine corsairs. You could tell by the red sashes they wore, with knives and flintlock pistols stuck in. A mean breed, fishing only when they couldn’t rob.\n\nThey came toward us, slowly and silently. The captain reached for his gun, but still they kept coming. There was one funny thing about that crowd — it wasn’t made up of men alone. Their animals were mixed in. Shoulder to shoulder with the Lazzes stalked their horses and dogs and cats. It gave us the creeps to see them slinking along without a sound.\n\nThe captain had his gun out when suddenly a young bull broke loose from among them and charged full speed at us, his horns low. We turned and ran along the beach, all four of us. The young Armenian was first, then the Turk and I. Noregard, the oldest, was behind. The crowd wasn’t silent now. Howling, barking, neighing, men and animals tore after us.\n\nIt couldn’t last long, not with the animals running us down. A big black dog tangled with my feet. I plowed headfirst into the sand, turned over just in time to give him a chance to spring at my throat. Noregard fired, and the dog went up squealing. There was no fight left in him when he hit the ground. His squeal changed to a low moan that sounded funny for a dog.\n\nI started running again, with Noregard’s bullets whistling past me as he tried to stop the bull. The Turk was tearing the biggest cat I’ve ever seen off his fat neck.\n\nI glanced back to see how close the pack was, and something colder than fear squeezed at my stomach. Where the wounded dog had fallen now there was a man, groaning and jerking. Maybe the captain’s bullet had got him and he had fallen there on top of the animal. But the bull was too close behind me to think about it any more.\n\nThe crowd, beasts and men, had formed a crescent, the fastest of them at the points, trying to close in on us, pressing us toward the peninsula. They would have cornered us there easily, except that the little temple caught the young Armenian’s eye. I don’t know what power guided him to it, but there he ran, and we followed.\n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, laughter came to us over the howling pursuit. A woman’s laughter. She was standing between the columns at the shrine’s portico. I’ve never seen anyone stop so fast as those Lazzes stopped. They fell to their knees. That is, the men did. The animals just stopped, looking at the men who were continuously beating salaams on the sand.\n\nThe woman started down the stairway, still laughing, her eyes on the Armenian. I slowed down. Maybe I was too tired to run fast, maybe something warned me not to approach that woman. I can’t tell. I only knew I wished then that I were back in the divinity school, studying dead languages and theology.\n\nShe was close to the Armenian. No one said a word. We were too breathless from our flight, too breathless from this beauty of hers. She wore a single white robe that fell in folds, covering her feet, so that she seemed to float instead of walk. And she was tall, taller than I, and blond, which is rare for the Levant these days.\n\nWe looked into her eyes, as blue as the Aegean water where the ship’s screw churns it. So beautiful they were that we didn’t even see all the evil in them — not till later. The Lazzes were still salaaming behind us, but we’d nearly forgotten about them.\n\nThe woman began speaking. I didn’t catch on at first. But it came to me suddenly. She was speaking, Greek. No, not the jargon in which the money changers in Constantinople try to outshout each other. This was the old Homeric Greek, the Greek of the heroes and the gods.\n\nI guess I was the only one who could understand.\n\n“You run fast,” she said to the Armenian, and her eyes were burning into the lad. “Fast and graceful — like an antelope.”\n\nThen she smiled at him and started backing away. There was nothing on his face but admiration. Without a word he followed her up the stone stairway and through the portico.\n\nThey disappeared inside. We could hear their voices, hers laughing, his imploring.\n\nCaptain Noregard tried to smile at me.\n\n“Love at first sight,” he said, and I knew from the twisted grin, from the unsteadiness of his voice, that he was jealous enough to curse.\n\n“I wonder who she is?” I remarked. “Do you suppose she’s a priestess of some kind?”\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and just then the Armenian’s voice in the temple stopped. In its place sharp sounds came to us, like the clicking of hard hoofs upon the stones.\n\n“I’m wet and hungry,” the fat Turk said. “Do you think she’d feed us if we asked?”\n\n“We can see,” said Noregard. “Let’s go in.”\n\nIt was a good idea for, with the woman’s disappearance, the Lazzes got up from their knees and they and their animals came closer.\n\nBut we didn’t find her. We thought she might have gone to a grove of olives that we could see on the other side of the temple, past a stone fountain. From the marble basin below that fountain a big antelope, the kind with short, curved horns, was drinking.\n\n“You run fast — like an antelope.”\n\nThe woman’s words came back to me as I watched the graceful creature. I guess he was the tamest antelope I’ve ever seen. He just looked up at our approach, then came to us. It gave me the creeps, the way he stared, and it set me thinking.\n\nThe Turk reached for his knife.\n\n“Maybe a steak. Captain?” He waited for approval.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Eyes\n\nSomething worse than seasickness hit my stomach at his words. I grabbed his arm as the animal looked at me. Those eyes — I never could forget them! There was so much sadness in them they seemed ready to cry.\n\nThe captain saw it too.\n\n“Let’s wait for her,” he said. “The Lazzes aren’t coming any closer. Maybe the place is taboo for them. We’ll ask the woman about grub when she comes back. I hope she comes soon.”\n\nPoor, foolish Captain Noregard. He didn’t know what he was hoping for.\n\nI sat on a stone and the antelope came to me. It made me feel funny, the way he nuzzled at my shoulder, as if he were trying to tell me something. I was thinking of the things I’d studied back in school, and watching the fat Turk. But the hunger had gone out of his pudgy face as he looked at the animal. And slowly fear crept into his eyes. Maybe he, too, had read the Odyssey. Maybe someone had told him of the witch who changed Ulysses’ men into beasts.\n\nBut what was I thinking of? I — a man of some learning. I tried to laugh, but the antelope nudged me harder, and I couldn’t.\n\n“Emery, you fool,” I could only say to myself. “Forget these crazy thoughts. This animal is just tame. That’s all. The Armenian and the woman are having a good time somewhere in the olives. It doesn’t make sense the other way. Nothing fits. Not even the name those dumb Lazzes called her by. It isn’t the same, Emery.”\n\nBut then, names change through the ages, get corrupted. Homer might have had it wrong.\n\n“Where the devil did they go?” Captain Noregard grumbled, and the jealousy was still gritting in his voice.\n\nHis big fingers played with the gun that had a shot or two left in it. He looked ugly, with his short black beard matted and wet from the sea.\n\nThe Turk was shaking harder and harder — maybe from the morning chill. Finally he picked up some twigs and branches and started himself a fire by the fountain. But that didn’t help him.\n\nHe was still shaking when the woman came out of the grove. The Armenian wasn’t with her, and I didn’t ask her where he was. I was afraid of what she might tell me.\n\nThe captain jumped to his feet at the sight of her. But she looked at the Turk and burst into a peal of silvery laughter.\n\n“You big fat pig!” she said, and laughed again. “You big fat shivering pig.”\n\nThose huge blue eyes of hers were on him across the fire, and he backed away. But he didn’t back far, for her eyes caught his and stopped him. I saw him strain to break away. A strong, heavy man pulling like a newly caught Indian elephant at his chain. He couldn’t make it. Then he reached for his knife, but his fingers opened the moment he grasped it. It fell to the ground by the fire, as step by step he went toward her, and she began to lead him toward the grove.\n\nThat was too much for Noregard. Jealous rage got the best of him. He whipped up his gun and sprang between her and the Turk. Maybe he would’ve shot the fat man, but she stepped in front of the captain, and her eyes caught his. She smiled understandingly at him, which was enough to make him drop his gun.\n\n“Why is the black-haired man angry?” her rich voice lilted. “Does the black-haired one with bristles on his face like a hedgehog want to come with me, too?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nThe Boar and the Hedgehog\n\nTHE captain couldn’t understand her words. He didn’t have to. That flowing movement of her body, that age-old beckoning of her eyes were plain enough. Side by side with the Turk he went.\n\nIt was then that I couldn’t stand it any longer. I couldn’t stay alone with the antelope, the sea, the Lazzes, and my own doubts. I couldn’t stay and wait — for what?\n\n“Captain Noregard — stop!” I yelled, and started running after him.\n\nHe wasn’t a big man, but a hard, close-knit one. Without even taking his eyes off her he struck me with his forearm. I reeled back and stumbled. The stone balustrade of the fountain caught me on the temple. For a moment I heard the woman’s laughter growing wilder and wilder. Then the sun went out….\n\nThe antelope’s rough tongue on my cheek brought me to. One look at him and I remembered where I was, and knew that I had to get away. But where?\n\nNow that the captain had drawn the Lazzes’ blood, now that the woman was gone, they wouldn’t stop at robbery. They would kill me as slowly and painfully as only they could. The sea? The hope to live was strong in me, for I was young. Perhaps I could sneak through the grove, past the woman.\n\nI picked up the Turk’s knife and crept among the olives. There weren’t many of them. I could see right through the grove as soon as I was in it. Nothing but cliffs behind it. One steep wall of cliffs where an earthquake had once sheared the island.\n\nAnd something else I saw — something that sent me running back faster than I came. In a small clearing she was sitting by a marble amphora like the ones I’d seen in the museums. From a shallow goblet she was drinking a liquid that was red and sticky. And she kept smiling as she watched a huge boar chasing a little hedgehog in front of her. Murder was burning in the boar’s mean, bloodshot eyes. The hedgehog’s black quills stood up on edge defensively around the cringing body that was smaller than a rabbit’s.\n\nThere was really no fight at all. There couldn’t have been. Maybe the quills did hurt the boar when his tusks closed on that little animal. I don’t know. I turned away, sickened by the crunching of thin bones.\n\nThe woman hadn’t noticed me yet, but I couldn’t reach the cliffs. If a twig snapped under me, if she turned her head, she would see me. Then she would look at me, and I was sure our eyes would meet, and after that … Yes, if our eyes met I’d become —\n\nSuddenly I knew what I had to do. It was ghastly, but it didn’t frighten me — not half as much as the thought of the antelope, the boar, the hedgehog, and the Lazzes’ animals.\n\nI went back to the fire that was still smoldering. A few more dry sticks brought it to life. Then I thrust the Turk’s knife into the flames. Fast! I had to be fast, before she tired of her sport, before she came for me. The blade got sooty at first, then started to glow. When it was cherry red I took it out.\n\nMy hand shook terribly, but I closed my eyes and touched the flat side of the knife to my lids. Oh, yes, it hurt — hurt so that I wished I’d lose consciousness.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nCall For Me\n\nMaybe I would have, but I heard steps — her light steps. She was coming from behind me, and couldn’t see my face even when she stopped.\n\n“Don’t you want to come with me?” she asked. “Don’t you want to belong to me, like the others?”\n\nI didn’t answer. How could I, with that pain and the fear?\n\nThat must have made her angry.\n\n“Look at me,” she ordered, and for the first time the lilt was gone from her voice. “Look at me, little man. After you do, you’ll follow me and drink my red wine of — “\n\nI turned my face slowly. She must have seen the burned wounds on my eyelids for she broke off abruptly, and it made me glad to know that I had won, that she couldn’t reach me. So glad that I tried to laugh. It was a gasping, agony-distorted laugh. I stopped, for when she spoke again the lilt was back in her voice.\n\n“You’re wise,” she mocked. “Wise as an old owl. You think you have outwitted me. For the time, maybe you have. But you have seen me, heard my voice. Though your eyes are gone, before the eyes of your soul you’ll carry my image as long as you live, and you’ll long for me. And when your longing gets so bad you can stand it no more, you’ll call for me. I’ll come then, and bring your friends with me. And then you’ll become — “\n\nI don’t remember the rest. The pain in my eyeballs tore at my brain. Crawling on my hands and knees, I got away from the place, away from her. On, on — any place.\n\nThe Lazzes must have found me later. I don’t know when or how. There is some nobility left in that old race, it seems. Fighting and running, I’d been their foe. But now that I was blind, they didn’t harm me. Later on that summer, when their barrels were full of herring, they sent me with the fishing fleet to Constantinople where the American consul …\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nMiss Stenger, the nurse, woke up suddenly and jumped from the rocking chair.\n\n“Captain Williams — Captain Gustafson!” she cried. “You shouldn’t have let him talk so much. He’s tired out. Go away now, please. He must have rest.”\n\nWe went out slowly while she lowered Emery onto his pillows. Outside, Gustafson looked at me sadly and shook his head, his big hands still cupped around his earholes.\n\n“Emery must be going fast. I didn’t hear all he said, but what I did hear proves he’s out of his mind. I’m going to miss him a lot, poor fellow.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nHe’s Gone\n\nWe parted there. I didn’t feel like discussing Emery by shouting into Gustafson’s cupped hand. I did a lot of thinking during the day, though, and tried to get hold of Commissioner Guire to tell him about Emery’s story and the shadows I had seen the night before. But Guire was busy with the police who had come to investigate about the gatekeeper’s wife. So I gave it up. He probably wouldn’t have believed me, anyhow.\n\nI didn’t sleep well that night, tossing and thinking. Once I thought I heard a woman’s laugh. It might have been my dreams, or maybe it was Miss Stenger, though I couldn’t see why she would laugh beside a dying man.\n\nThen, early in the morning, a scream woke me out of a doze. Of course, I couldn’t get up by myself, though I tried to. I had to wait for Yorgo.\n\n“What was all the screaming about?” I asked. “How’s Captain Emery?”\n\n“He’s gone,” said Yorgo, and reached for my uniform.\n\n“What do you mean? Did he die?” I liked old Emery a lot. Maybe that’s why my voice sounded so hopeful.\n\n“I guess so,” Yorgo replied. “Last night Miss Stenger snoozed off, she claims. When she woke up toward morning the screen on the window was torn out and Emery was missing. He must have crawled out and fallen off the cliffs into the sea. Though how he did it with both legs dead I can’t tell.\n\n“And a funny thing, Captain Williams. The night light in his room being on, and the screen out, a big owl must have flown in. It scared Miss Stenger so she yelled when she woke up. Took me quite a while to chase the blooming bird out. It beat around the walls for a long time, as if it couldn’t find it’s way. And when I finally pushed it out with a broom, it flew straight away over the sea. It seemed to be blind. But then, it was pretty light already, and all owls are blind in daylight.”\n\nI intended to tell him he was wrong, that normal owls see in daytime almost as well as at night, in spite of popular belief. But what was the use of arguing with someone who had been a cook on a Greek sponger?\n\nTHE END\nBack to Top\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Seat Engaged?\n  Huntington Station\n  Well, Who Are You?\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nSeat Engaged?\n\nYoung Ryan looked down the Worcester platform through the canyon formed by the mail and express cars. Catching the desired final signal, he passed the word to his chief, Carruthers.\n\nCarruthers unthrottled the giant at his command; and the long heavy Boston express got under way, with a deep and mighty puffing of the engine, the dull grind of its reluctant wheels, the clank of trucks and the clink-clank of the couplings as each preceding coach began to move and communicated motion to the following.\n\nAs the train gathered way rapidly — fifteen minutes behind schedule on its way to Boston — a tall man in a dark blue suit emerged from somewhere among the clutter of trunks and crates and bales and, running alongside of the smoking car, grasped the rail of the end of the car and after a few paces swung himself aboard, going swiftly up the steps and entering the coach.\n\nHe passed up the car looking from left to right. The car was exceedingly crowded, some men sitting on the arm rests of the seats, and even then in the middle of the afternoon it was almost dusky because of tobacco smoke.\n\nThe tall man went up the car slowly, but saw no vacant seat. There were two or three groups of card players, but, notwithstanding this, all the seats seemed to be taken. The traveler who had made the train by the skin of his teeth, as the saying is, passed the groups of players and went on.\n\nThe fourth seat from the front of the coach on the right-hand side was occupied by but one person — a stout, sleek, prosperous-looking man of fifty or thereabouts, dressed in a neat gray suit and wearing a mouse-colored fedora. At this seat, the tall man halted.\n\n“Seat engaged?” he asked.\n\nThe other man looked up and smiled slightly in good humor. He had a merry, but very keen blue eye, and his face had a healthy glow of red and tan — the face of an outdoor man or of a business man who is faithful to his golf. He shook his head and moved in a trifle farther toward the window.\n\nThe tall man sat down and relaxed, leaning his trim, broad shoulders back against the seat. He was a fine-looking man between thirty-five and forty, with a hawk-like, yet boyish face. After a covert scrutiny of his seatmate from deep-set, keen dark eyes, he drew down his felt hat somewhat over his forehead and seemed to compose himself for a nap.\n\nWhile he sat in this position with his eyes closed, the stout man looked him over, studying his face and clothes — apparently puzzled. The tall, athletic man was neatly dressed, but, somehow or other, he seemed to give his clothes distinction and seemed not to get from the clothes the setting proper for such a trim, handsome fellow.\n\nThe forward door of the coach opened, and the conductor, spectacles perched on the top of his nose, came in, followed by an assistant.\n\nWhen the door opened, Durkee, the tall man, opened his eyes and began leisurely to reach into his pockets for ticket or money. From the first pocket his hand came out empty, and an odd expression came across his face. He sat upright and hastily, but without flurry, searched for the necessary tender. Presently, he gave a shrug of the shoulders and sat back. He was a man of the world — that was clear — but, notwithstanding, he was mentally squirming as the conductor, a grizzled-haired man with a stiletto eye and a very short, but polite tongue, collected from one man and then another.\n\nDurkee gave an inaudible breath of embarrassment and vexation as the official at length stood next to him, actually touching him as he leaned over to give a mere glance at the stout man’s punched slip tucked in the hold in the seat ahead.\n\n“Ticket, sir,” said the conductor,\n\nDurkee looked up, a slight smile on his dark, handsome face.\n\n“I came away in a hurry,” he said, “and I haven’t a red cent on me as far as I can find.”\n\nThere was just a moment of silence, and Durkee felt that embarrassment which any roan, no matter how practiced a traveler he may be, feels when he is without funds and left to the mercy of a man who daily has to judge between humbugs and innocents.\n\n“We stop at Framingham, sir, I’m sorry, but” —\n\n“Beg pardon,” interposed the stout man, turning to Durkee with a smile. “Where you going?”\n\n“Boston?” answered Durkee.\n\n“What’s the tax, Doctor?” inquired the stout man, blandly.\n\nThe conductor named the price and prepared a rebate slip and passed it to the stout man when he had paid Durkee’s fare.\n\n“I haven’t even my watch on,” said Durkee when the conductor had passed on. “I’m very much obliged to you.”\n\n“Don’t mention it, my friend. I’ve been in similar predicaments.”\n\nThey conversed for a little while on general topics of the time — cautious on the subject of politics — but presently lapsed into silence and rode on for ten or fifteen minutes without speaking.\n\n“Live in Boston?” asked Grant, breaking the silence.\n\n“No,” returned Durkee. His tone was not of rebuff, but he volunteered no information about himself.\n\n“By the way,” he said, at length, “if you’ll give me your name and address, I’ll send you my fare.”\n\nMr. Grant waved his hand and uttered a little laugh.\n\n“That’s all right,” he said.\n\n“It’s not all right,” declared the other, mildly emphatic. “There’s no reason why you should pay my fare.”\n\nMr. Grant half turned and looked his seatmate over with a marvelously quick glance.\n\n“If that’s the way you feel about it, Mister,” he said slowly, “it may be you can do a little bit of a favor for me.”\n\nDurkee in his turn eyed his seat-mate again in a furtive manner, his deep-set, sharp eye missing nothing. A little curve appeared at the corners of his mouth — but went quickly away.\n\n“The fact is, I’m in a mean little fix,” said Grant. “I suppose I can rest in confidence upon your word of secrecy if you don’t care to help me?”\n\n“Yes — if I pass my word,” responded Durkee.\n\n“And do you pass the word?” asked the other, quickly.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, this is the case. Maybe you’ve heard of the Pelton bank robbery a few days ago?”\n\n“No,” said Durkee. “Don’t recall hearing about it.”\n\nThe stout man looked surprised, seemed about to say something, then apparently changed his line of thought and speech.\n\n“Well, there was one there, and they say the robbers got away with about — I think about twenty thousand, or something like that. There was a lot of talk about some of the town police being mixed up in the business, and some of the — er, officers are in a peck of trouble over it.”\n\n“All news to me,” asserted the tall man, carelessly.\n\n“The truth is, Mister, I’m one of the officers there in Pelton, and definite charges have been made against me. In fact, confidentially, I was to be arrested, and I’m on my way to Boston to see some friends — high-up fellows who can do things. See?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“As I say, the fellows are out to ‘get’ me — it’s a frame-up back there, you see; — and I got a feeling that I may be pinched in the South Station. Now, you can see — any man of good sense knows how these things go — that if I don’t get to my friends first I’ll be in a pretty pickle. That’d be a trump play against me. I don’t want to be caught in Boston and sidetracked and have it come out in the Boston papers and copied at home.”\n\n“I don’t blame you,” commented Durkee, looking at the other from the corner of his eye, a thrill running through him.\n\n“No, I don’t think anybody can blame me,” said Grant — “anybody who knows about politics. Now, the idea that came to me was this — that you and I put on a pair of handcuffs and give those fellows the slip in the station, just as if you were taking me down. Get the idea?”\n\n“Yes, but I don’t carry such articles with me — not as a rule,’’ responded Durkee, with a grin.\n\n“Well, I always do, of course. Do you think you could help me, through the crowd, taking the part of an officer conducting me to the authorities?”\n\nDurkee smiled, looking at the other covertly with a queer light back in his keen eyes.\n\n“Suppose I can’t bluff the thing through, my friend, if you’re right and someone’s waiting for you? — what then?”\n\nGrant turned and looked squarely at him for an instant.\n\nDuring that instant all the humor was absent from his blue eyes, in its place a hard, very hard look.\n\nThen he laughed shortly, that odd gleam disappearing.\n\n“Why,” he said, at length, “I’ll release you and do the best I can.”\n\n“They might hold me under the circumstances. Couldn’t blame them much. It’s pretty risky, Mister, I should say.”\n\nGrant looked out of the window for a few moments and then turned back to the other, failing to see the look of satisfaction or triumph — or whatever it was — that passed over Durkee’s face.\n\n“I shall be glad to give you say, fifty dollars, young man. I mean, of course, this in addition to your fare,” he supplemented, jokingly.\n\n“I don’t see that it can do much harm, anyway,” remarked Durkee, rather carelessly. “The only danger is that they might make things unpleasant for me.”\n\n“Oh, I’ll see that you don’t get in wrong, anyway.”\n\n“Well, then, I’ll try to help you out,” promised Durkee. “Got ‘em?”\n\nAfter a careful glance about. Grant produced a pair of handcuffs. He clicked one hold on his left wrist, and then Durkee, after a slight hesitation, linked his thin, sinewy, long-fingered hand to the other’s.\n\nIn this fashion they rode the rest of the way to Boston, avoiding the subject which linked them together and chatting casually on various matters of interest to ordinary citizens.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nHuntington Station\n\nThe express stopped at Huntington Station. A few people got off, and a few got on. Two broad-shouldered, keen-eyed men, obviously together, came into the smoking-car by way of the forward door and came down looking from left to right. They noted Grant and Durkee and the bond that held them, and without comment passed on, swiftly, but in a very business-like way.\n\n“No one I know,” announced Grant, as the two went on after the first glance.\n\nHe spoke in a matter-of-fact way, but Durkee perceived that he was really much relieved. The train got under way after a very short stop and sped on, finally coming to journey’s end under the mammoth shed of South Station.\n\nDurkee and Grant descended promptly from the smoker and went up to the shed with the crowd. The tide of people converged and narrowed as it approached the gate of the shed and, passing through the entrance, spread out into the open space and began immediately to lose its entity among the throng scurrying here and there in every direction.\n\nAs Durkee and Grant passed through the gateway and bore off to the left, neither hurrying nor lagging, a burly, ruddy-faced man in dark clothes came from the fence — noting them as soon as they issued from the shed.\n\n“Well, well — hello, Kelly,” he said, mockingly jovial, but with an under-note of real and intense satisfaction, and as he gave the greeting he grasped Mr. Grant by the arm, apparently ready for trouble, as if he knew something about the peculiar light that could shine in the other’s eyes.\n\nAt the same moment he noticed Durkee and the bond between him and the stout man he addressed as Kelly. He lifted his eyebrows in surprise and favored Durkee with a steady and half-hostile look.\n\nAs this man accosted and touched Grant, another big man of the same cut approached from another direction and joined the trio, a little grin coming to his face as he saw Grant.\n\n“Hello, Kelly,” said this newcomer, speaking very much as the other stranger had spoken. “At last!”\n\n“Hello, Moran,” returned Mr. Grant, with composure.\n\n“Excuse me, gentlemen,” put in Durkee, promptly and courteously, “but it’s hands off for you. Nothing doing at all. I got Kelly for the First National break in Portland two years ago. Lighted on him in Worcester by accident. Sorry” — a tantalizing slight grin came on his hawk-like face — “but you can come up and have him in just about twelve years.”\n\nThe first burly man drew back a pace, scowling. Then he shrugged his broad shoulders resignedly and used strong language feelingly.\n\nKelly, for his part, shot a quick glance at the man whose fare he had paid, his blue eyes like rapier points; but after that look he glanced at the disappointed Boston men and laughed at them.\n\n“Tough luck, boys,” said Durkee, “but you can have him when we’re through. Come on, old bird.”\n\nHe gave Kelly a slight tug, and, Kelly grinning queerly, they walked elbow to elbow through the throng and out of the station.\n\nDurkee secured a taxicab and, having given his direction — North Station — entered the designated cab with his captive.\n\nWhen they were in the vehicle, Durkee pulled the curtain on his side half way down, Kelly following suit at his request.\n\n“Well, I’ll be confounded!” exclaimed Kelly as they crossed the tracks and went into Atlantic Avenue. “You got a quick wit, my friend.”\n\nHe looked steadily at his companion through half-closed lids. Producing a key, he reached over to insert it.\n\nAs his right hand came down, Durkee’s left hand, with long, sinewy fingers, closed over it with a grip of steel and suddenly twisted the key from the other’s possession.\n\nKelly, protruding his head bellicosely, glared at Durkee, his eyes now green and glinting; and Durkee met his glare with a dancing light in his eyes.\n\n“Come across now, Kelly,” said Durkee coolly, a grin coming to his face.\n\n“So you’re the real thing, are you,” exclaimed Kelly with a vicious sneer — “a real bull, eh? Walked right into you, didn’t I? Funny, too, ‘cause I had a feeling before we got to Boston that there was something off about you. Well, well.”\n\nHe spoke evenly and smoothly now, and settled back a little.\n\nDurkee held his free hand to the window and kept his eye upon the other man.\n\n“Don’t you pull that gun, Kelly,” he said, quietly, in a quick warning. “or I’ll drop the key and smash you. And come across!”\n\n“That’s your game, eh?”\n\n“That — or delivery in Portland. I knew you were Kelly two minutes after we began to talk?”\n\n“How much? — a hundred?”\n\nDurkee laughed mirthlessly, and dexterously released his right hand from the cuff and slipped the key in his pocket.\n\n“All you got on you now,” he answered, sitting tense like a coiled spring.\n\nAs he spoke, Kelly — having hesitated just long enough to let Durkee free his hand, although noting his action — drew back with a jerk; and at the instant he drew back, his hand whipping behind, Durkee fell upon him like a bolt of lightning.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nWell, Who Are You?\n\nKelly was a hard man and a fighter; but the younger man, trim and lithe, was a tiger, and in less than two minutes he had him half throttled and had his right hand in the hold of the cuff he himself had worn.\n\nHe took Kelly’s automatic from the hip pocket and placed it upon his own person and then, ruthlessly bearing the stubborn, undaunted bank robber down, made an exceedingly rich haul from various parts of Kelly’s clothes — -thousands of dollars in notes of large denominations — all of which he placed in his own pockets, despite the other’s vicious struggling.\n\nAs soon as he had convinced himself that he had taken all the money Kelly had, Durkee signaled the taxi chauffeur to stop, and when the car had come to a standstill at the curb he opened the door and stepped out into the late afternoon sunshine and the atmosphere of fish and dirty water.\n\n“Kelly,” said he with a grin, “I’ll give the key to his nibs here and tell him to unlock you at the North Station. From there you may go anywhere you please.”\n\n“Who the blazes are you, anyway?” demanded Kelly, after delivering a volley of vituperation — the only effect of which was to make the other man’s grin broaden.\n\n“See here, Kelly,” said Durkee, calmly, making no response to the question, “you haven’t any kick coming. I got you through the line all right, saved you from a lot of trouble, and I know you got a lot of stuff somewhere. I kept my word not to squeal, and you can afford to pay. So quit your growling.”\n\n“Well, who are you?”\n\n“Really like to know?”\n\n“Yes,” returned Kelly with a savage, almost frenzied growl.\n\n“Well,” said Durkee, smoothly, with great gravity — mock, maddening gravity — “I’ll tell if you think it will make you feel better. My name is Ricker H. Tucker in real life. By profession I am, like you yourself — a bank robber; but an unfortunate one, mediocre, and until two days ago I was incarcerated in a New Hampshire retreat, I had just worked down to Worcester, and there, as you know, fortune brought me face to face, side by side, with the master of our craft — Aloysius Kelly — fortune at the same time giving me an opportunity to run the Boston lookout and to fill an empty pocket. I admire you, Kelly — I take off my hat to you” — the tall, eagle-faced rascal who had indulged himself in the luxury of several truthful statements took off his hat with an ironical bow — “and as one who has done time, I admiringly admit that you’re the better man, and — I thank you.”\n\nDurkee slammed the door, gave the handcuff key to the chauffeur and told him to drive to North Station and there release Kelly. He was sport enough to pay for the ride, too, — with a bit to spare.\n\nAs the cab darted from the curb with the frantic Kelly, he looked after it for a moment with a smile, then, turning, walked swiftly back in the way he had come.\n\nThat same night Mr. Durkee sat smoking contentedly on the deck of a barkentine passing the Graves en route for Rio de Janeiro. He was thinking of the stout man whom he had helped as desired — the king of bank robbers who had never served a sentence, whose reputation he himself had that day saved — but was not worrying about him or his welfare. It was natural that he should think of him, for he had secured from brother Kelly the snug sum of $15,000 plus. But mostly he was letting his mind dwell virtuously upon reform under comfortable conditions, upon a life of strict obedience to the law — at least while the money lasted.\n\n~THE END~\n"

      "content_html": "Is the Great Reporter Detective Only a Memory? Where Are the Stars Today?\n\nHe has gone. Or, at any rate, all but passed off the lively, vivid newspaper stage where once he played its most romantic and brilliant roles–the star reporter.\n\nHe would be as desirable as ever in an editorial room. But he is scarcely to be found in any of them any more.\n\nThe newly created schools and colleges of journalism do not, it would appear, breed him, nor does the modern newspaper develop him. There are some of the Old Guard left. But few — very. The ranks have grown exceedingly thin. And no replacements in sight.\n\nThe star reporter was a rare being. He was a ferret for facts and a poet for fancy — a de luxe combination for his craft. He could sit in the wild turmoil of a huge political convention, look into it with a cool, analytical eye and produce a crisp, colorful, historical classic of reporting before the roars around him subsided. Or he could step into a sordid police court and come out of it with a piece of literature.\n\nAside from the versatility of his writing gift, the vital characteristic of the star reporter was his intense curiosity regarding human life. He scorned to view it from a club window or a mount of philosophy or through a cold scientific lens. He wanted to be of it, with it, see and study it “close-up,” all phases of it, high, middle, and low. And then tell his fellow men about it accurately and picturesquely. And what made him a star reporter was that he always did–always delivered. Physical weariness following the gruelling pursuit for information amid disasters and vast public events, illness, personal worries and griefs couldn’t beat him down. He always “came through” and that brilliantly with his “yarn.” He played his health and safety recklessly in the high adventures his profession offered him.\n\nHis country might come first but certainly his “sheet”, his “rag”, his paper came closely next in his devotion and loyalty. He’d risk his neck any time for it. No command could be too bizarre, no “stunt” too hazardous. He was underpaid, knew it, and didn’t care. He loved the game, loved the epithet of “Staff Man” that carried him into the acquaintance of statesmen, kings, queens and princes, inventors, soldiers, generalissimos of industry, actors, artists, dramatists, poets, novelists, political bosses, cops, cabbies, newsboys, adventuresses, the great beauties of his time, the great criminals of his era of both sexes. He loved the game, loved the thrill of looking with his own eyes on the wonders of the earth — the magnificent, the beautiful, the strange, the queer, the brilliant and the drab. That was his pay and he deemed it rich. Unless he moved onward to become a successful novelist or playwright, he invariably died poor, hands stainless of the thousands of dollars of bribe money that could countless times have been his for the contemptible taking.\n\nEvery one of him I ever knew affected a tremendously cynical air. But what his editors knew and what he himself thoroughly well knew was that the diamond of his quality lay in that he was a sheer romantic, that to the end of his existence he was squarely gifted to look upon the spectacle of life with the keen, excited interest of youth! And convey what he heard and saw in buoyant, striking, sparkling words back to his fellow man.\n\nThe number of really great reporters to have been given the blazonry of public fame as star reporters — many afterwards attaining it in literature and politics — is scant. In days not very long past the accolade of having one’s name signed to his “story” was sparingly accorded — given only on the achievement of a superlatively momentous “scoop” or brilliantly written article. Men had to step high and fast to win it. All were sufficiently human to desire it. But above it they valued the honor they had earned among the men of their guild. And this they got openly from the cordiality of their editors to the mute hero worship in the eye of the office boy.\n\nOne thinks of Henry M. Stanley as the first of the star reporters brilliantly carrying through the assignment from the New York Herald to succor Dr. Livingston in the heart of the African jungles. Spick and span Richard Harding Davis, as romantic and handsome a figure as ever a moving-picture star could simulate. And a great reporter. Big Karl Decker rescuing Evangelina Cisneros from the Morro Castle, Sylvester Scovel taking a smack at General Shafter for getting in the way of his story at the triumphant raising of the flag of the United States on the surrender of Spain.\n\nJames Creelmen interviewing monarchs and premiers right and left and for whom even the doors of the Vatican, in his time closely shut against publicity, opened for his admittance to the Pope. Irvin Cobb taking rank as a national humorist by way of his despatches describing the RussoJapanese peace conference at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\n\nWill Irwin and his page story modestly signed at the bottom, of the San Francisco earthquake disaster — a story that was pasted up on every editorial room bulletin board in every city of the country. Isaac White of the World identifying by means of the single clue of a button the man who had tried to kill Russell with a bomb but blew himself to atoms in the attempt.\n\nMrs. Gilmer (Dorothy Dix) who in active days reported celebrated murder trials, small, all womanly, eschewing the reporters’ tables for an obscure seat among the spectators. O. K. Davis, Ralph D. Paine, Herbert Bayard Swope —\n\nBut I must put up the traffic signal against this procession of newspaper stars who became popular notables, in favor of some of the great star reporters of whom you never heard.\n\nThe last banquet ever held at historic Delmonico’s was tendered by New York newspapermen to Dr. Eliphalet Cohen on his seventieth birthday anniversary. He was the dean of the star reporters of three decades and active to within a few weeks of his death, writing into succinct, graceful English the cruder efforts of new reporters. The urbane Jack Slaight of the World before whom walls of secrecy always crumbled. Martin Green, George Buchanan Fyfe, Lindsay Denison, Edwin C. Hill, “Willie” Willis, the O’Brien brothers, Joe and Frank, “Deacon” Terry, all that shining company I knew and a host more — expert delvers for fact and information, discerning, deductive of mind, swift word painters in sharp and vivid colors. And Gus Roeder of the World! Told to find out the destination of a Navy cruiser just departing and refused the information, no sooner was the anchor chain hauled in than Gus went up with the anchor and found out where the cruiser was going by going with it! In irons.\n\nI have mentioned only some of the “big shots” and only of the New York field. Every other large city, of course, had its brilliant coterie.\n\nBut he’s gone, has the star reporter. It certainly looks it. If he hasn’t, where was he hiding during the World War?\n\nNot one of them showed in it or came out of it. I could mention Roy Howard — but he was no longer a reporter; he was head of a great newspaper chain when he pulled off the armistice scoop. And Frazier Hunt and George Pattulo — but they were writers.\n\nIf he still exists where the devil has he been during all the great air adventures of the decade? He has figured in only two. Payne of the Mirror who lost his life in a transAtlantic try, von Wiegand, the only reporter on the world ‘round trip of the Graf-Zeppelin. Both bred in the star reporter era, however. The “last leaf” would seem to be Russell Owen, once “baby member” of the Sun staff, who accompanied the Byrd arctic expeditions and wrote beautifully about them.\n\nMy flesh creeps at the thought that the once sturdy, heroic field of journalism is doomed to dwindle to a mere bed of blushing violets!\n\n~THE END~\n"

That is what happened at the dance which Colonel MacIntyre gave at Glen Erradale House.\n\nIt was a small dance, with fifteen or twenty people, and just before midnight everyone seemed to go stale. They stood about in little groups, talking in low voices.\n\nOne man alone was at his ease. He stood with his back to the wide oak mantelpiece, a black pipe gripped between his teeth and a faint smile creasing the tanned smoothness of his face. Dixon Hawke was a friend of the Colonel, and he had come north for the shooting, accompanied by Tommy Burke.\n\nColonel MacIntyre waylaid his nephew, Hugh Charteris.\n\n“For goodness sake, Hugh, my boy, think of something,” he whispered urgently. “They’re standing about like a lot of sheep on market day.”\n\nHugh grinned. “It’s all right, Uncle. I’ve a scheme that’ll waken ‘em up all right.” He turned towards the room.\n\n“Listen, folks!” he shouted. “I’ve got an idea. What about a game of ‘Murder’?”\n\nThere was a murmur of interest, and the guests crowded around him.\n\n“In case some of you don’t happen to know it,” he went on, “I’d better explain the game.\n\n“It’s like this. We each pick a card from a pack containing the same number of cards as the number of people present. The pack always includes the ace of spades and the ace of hearts. Whoever gets the ace of hearts is a detective. Whoever gets the ace of spades is the murderer. And any of the rags is the murderee. The lights are switched off at the main. The murderer murders one of you. And the detective has to find out who the murderer is. The victim screams once when he’s being ‘murdered.’ Then the murderer gets half a minute before the lights are switched on again. Get it?”\n\nThere was a shout of approval. The party had miraculously come to life again. Hugh found a pack of cards, and when they had been dealt out, Colonel MacIntyre sent word to the servants’ quarters that the lights were going to be switched out. Then he went to the cupboard in the main hall, where the main switch was situated, and a few seconds later Glen Erradale House was plunged into darkness.\n\nThe guests began to spread out over the house, feeling their way along walls and banisters. It was their object to keep as far apart from each other as possible, for no one knew for certain that a companion might not also be a potential “murderer.”\n\nMoonlight streamed in through the high old windows, and the breakers of Loch Erradale growled ceaselessly on the rocks of the shore below.\n\nSuddenly a scream rang out. And when the lights were switched on and the guests began to gather again in the big lounge that had been cleared for dancing, they found Hugh Charteris lying on his back on a sofa. A handkerchief tied round his neck showed the manner in which he had been “murdered.”\n\nEveryone waited expectantly. Then Dixon Hawke stepped forward and laid the ace of hearts on the arm of the sofa.\n\n“H’m! Strangled! Poor fellow!” he said gravely.\n\nColonel MacIntyre came into the room. Hawke turned quickly and pointed to him.\n\n“Arrest that man!” he said crisply.\n\n“What the devil —” the Colonel spluttered. “How the deuce did you know, Hawke?”\n\n“You took rather over a minute to get back and switch on the lights again, Colonel.”\n\nThere was a roar of laughter, and the Colonel said dryly, “Well, I suppose we’d better try again. But you and I won’t play this time, Hawke. Carry on with the deal, Hugh.”\n\n“Wait a minute,” said Hugh. “Where’s Jane?”\n\nJane Corry was the only one of the guests who had not returned. She and Hugh were engaged.\n\nThe Colonel chuckled. “Jane has probably very wisely found herself a corner where she can hide. She’ll turn up all right. Carry on.”\n\nHugh said nothing, and began to deal out the cards.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nJane Corry’s Fate\n\nWhen Colonel MacIntyre went to switch off the lights again, Hawke accompanied him. They stood together at the door of the cupboard for some minutes, and then, for the second time that night, a scream shattered the stillness that hung over the old house.\n\nThe Colonel counted thirty slowly. Then he threw up the main switch, and, blinking in the sudden glare, he and Dixon Hawke went out into the hall.\n\nAlready people were beginning to gather there. Hugh Charteris, with an ace of hearts in his hand, came in.\n\nWell,” he said. “ Where’s the body? I can’t very well —”\n\nHe stopped suddenly. Hawke, following his eyes, saw a dark girl, Mary Cullies, the daughter of a neighbouring laird, swaying in the curtained entrance to a passage. Her lips were trembling, and her face white as a sheet. She was falling when Hawke took three quick steps forward and caught, her.\n\n” What is it?” he demanded. “What’s the matter?”\n\nShe had difficulty in speaking. But at last she said:\n\n“In the cloakroom — the one next Colonel MacIntyre’s study. There’s something behind the door. I think it’s a — a body!”\n\nShe broke down then, and Hawke handed her gently to the Colonel. With Hugh Charteris at his heels, he brushed aside the curtain and went into the passage. It was half a dozen yards in length, with only two doors in it. One was that of the study, and the other opened into a small, seldom-used cloakroom. Hawke pushed this open, noticing that it moved sluggishly. What seemed to he a heavy bundle of coats was hanging on the hack of it. Hawke threw the topmost coat aside, and Hugh Charteris, behind him, gave a choking cry. For Jane Corry was hanging by a coat-belt from the hook.\n\nHawke pushed him gently outside, and called urgently to the Colonel. Together they lifted the girl down, but Hawke’s experienced eye had already told him that she was dead.\n\n“Better take her into your study, Mac,” said Hawke crisply.\n\n“I’ll get some of my men along at once, too,” said the Colonel. He was the Chief Constable of the county.\n\nTommy Burke appeared at that moment, and helped to carry the girl into the study.\n\n“I’ve told everybody to wait in the lounge, guv’nor,” he said breathlessly.\n\nHawke nodded. “That’s right, my lad. Go along there now and see that none of them leaves the room.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Colonel’s Shotgun\n\nTommy went back down the passage, and while the Colonel was telephoning, he examined the cloakroom. It was a small room about ten feet square, with coat-hooks round three walls and a handbasin in the fourth. It had no window.\n\nWhen he had finished. Hawke went into the study. Colonel MacIntyre replaced the receiver and turned to him.\n\n“This is ghastly, Hawke. It’s poor Hugh I’m most sorry for. And in my own house —”\n\nDixon Hawke nodded absently. He was standing at the side of a couch, staring down at the dead girl.\n\n“What makes you so sure that it’s murder?” he asked.\n\n“She’d have had to stand on something and then kick it away,” said the Colonel quietly. “There was nothing in the cloakroom that would have served. Besides, there was no earthly reason for suicide.”\n\n“You’re quite right,” said Hawke slowly. “It was murder, planned to look like suicide. And it wasn’t committed in the cloakroom.”\n\n“How do you know?”\n\n“One of her shoes is missing. Came off in the struggle, I expect. There must have been a struggle. She was strangled by hand. You can tell that from the marks on her throat.”\n\n“Then where the shoe is, she was murdered?”\n\nHawke nodded his head. “Very possibly. And she wasn’t killed, for example, in the lounge and carried here across the hall, or in one of the bedrooms and carried downstairs. It’s only logical to suppose that she was killed in the only other room in this passage.”\n\n“You mean in here, Hawke — in my study?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“But where’s the shoe?”\n\n“I don’t know. It may have been thrust into a drawer. Your men can look for it when they come.”\n\nA few minutes later, a sergeant and two constables were shown into the room.\n\nOne of the constables was sent to round up the servants and take them to the lounge, and the sergeant and the other constable were instructed to search the house, particularly for the missing shoe.\n\nThe Colonel himself searched the study. While he was doing so, Hawke looked slowly round the room. His eye finally came to rest on a sporting gun resting on two hooks on the wall near the door. He stared at it for a moment with a puzzled frown. Then he said: “I didn’t know you were left-handed, Mac.”\n\nThe Colonel straightened himself. “I’m not. Why?”\n\n“Do you clean your guns yourself?”\n\n“No. Except that one you’re looking at. I wouldn’t let anyone else handle that. It’s a special Purdy I got as a presentation.”\n\n“Curious,” mused Hawke. “Do you notice that the barrel’s on the right and the stock on the left? A right-handed man would put it up the other way — with the stock to the right. Try it yourself.”\n\nThe Colonel picked up the gun, frowned, turned it about and replaced it.\n\n“You’re right, Hawke,” he said. “It’s been moved.”\n\n“By a left-handed man. Now, I wonder —” said Hawke.\n\n“I don’t see that it has anything to do with the case, anyhow,” said the Colonel. “Some deuced inquisitive servant been examining it, I suppose. Now I think we’d better interview these people.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nWhose Falsehood\n\nIt was a tiring interview. All the guests had the same story to tell — of edging along darkened corridors with nerves pleasantly tingling, of fitful moonlight streaming through windows that framed a dark vista of Loch Erradale, and the black shapes of the hills on the far shore. Mary Gillies told how she had gone to the cloakroom by the Colonel’s study to hide, how she had felt the hanging form behind the door and had screamed in terror and rushed out to the hall.\n\nThe servants’ stories were equally unhelpful. The butler, a grave, portly man, said that while the lights were out some of the servants were up in their bedrooms. He himself had been in the servants’ hall. He did not know where Charles, the footman, had been.\n\nThe footman was the last to be interviewed. He was thin and dark, with a tanned skin that seemed strangely out of keeping with his calling.\n\n“How long have you been employed here?” Hawke asked him. Colonel MacIntyre and he were the only others present in the lounge by this time.\n\n“A matter of weeks, sir,” said the footman. “I am employed in a temporary capacity at the moment.”\n\nHawke glanced at the Colonel, who nodded.\n\n“He was in my employment once before — “\n\nHawke looked up at the footman. “When?” he asked.\n\nCharles looked momentarily startled. “Well, sir, I’m not quite sure. It would be during the war, I think.”\n\n“Where were you employed before this?”\n\n“I was a ship’s steward, sir.”\n\n“Anything you can tell us that might help?”\n\n“I’m afraid not, sir. I was in my room all the time that the lights were out.”\n\n“That will do, then,” said Hawke abruptly. “There’s a wineglass on the floor behind the door. You’d better remove it as you go out, in case someone breaks it.”\n\nThe footman hesitated at the door. Then he bent down swiftly, and with an expert movement, scooped the wineglass up by its stem.\n\nHawke watched him curiously. As the door closed softly, he turned to the Colonel.\n\n“Wonderful how adept these fellows get when they’re trained as stewards,” he remarked. “But I’m afraid he wasn’t telling us the truth. Or else your butler wasn’t.”\n\n“How do you know?” asked the Colonel curiously.\n\n“When we were standing at the door of the switch-cupboard a man crossed the hall in the darkness. But he passed through a shaft of moonlight from the window at the top of the stairs. And it flashed on silver buttons.”\n\nThe Colonel nodded. “And they’re the only two, of course, with silver buttons. But I can’t believe that Graham would lie, and Charles — as he said — was with me once before.”\n\n“When?”\n\n“I can’t just recollect the exact circumstances. But I knew his face the moment he applied for this post. And when I asked if he’d been with me before, he said yes.”\n\nHawke’s attention seemed to have drifted away as the Colonel finished speaking. Suddenly he gave a low whistle and slapped his knee.\n\n“Got it! “ he exclaimed. “I see it all now. Where do you keep your tobacco, Mac?”\n\nThe Colonel’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. “In my tobacco jar — on the little table by the fireplace in my study. Why?”\n\n“It wasn’t in the room when we went in with the dead girl. I knew something was missing, but I couldn’t think what. And when you unwound the coat-belt from her neck you laid it down on that very table — where the tobacco jar should have been.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nAn “Accidental” Murder\n\nThe door opened, and Tommy thrust his head round it.\n\n“Sergeant’s out here with the shoe, guv’nor. Will I show him in?”\n\nHawke nodded, and Tommy and the sergeant came into the room. The sergeant had a black evening slipper in his hand.\n\n“It was in Miss Margaret Charteris’s room, sir — she is a sister of Mr. Hugh,” he reported. “It is next door to the dead young lady’s room.”\n\n“Where are these rooms, Colonel?” asked Hawke swiftly.\n\n“In a passage near the back of the house.”\n\n“And the passage leads to —? “\n\n“There are one or two other rooms in it. And at the end a service stair.”\n\n“Good! “ said Hawke. “I think we have him.”\n\nHe rose suddenly to his feet and strode across the room. “But I still can’t find the motive.”\n\nHe stood thinking for a moment. Then he took an old envelope from his pocket, scribbled something on the back of it, and handed it to Tommy.\n\n“Off you go, my lad,” he said crisply. “And take care. I don’t want to lose you.”\n\nTommy glanced at the paper, grinned at his chief, and went out.\n\n“Anything of value in the house, Mac?” Hawke asked.\n\nThe Colonel thought for a moment and shook his head. “No. No, I don’t think so. I’ve one or two trinkets in the safe in my study —”\n\n“In the study? A safe? I didn’t see it,” said Hawke sharply.\n\n“It’s a wall safe,” explained the Colonel. “It’s concealed behind a picture. But there’s nothing of direct value in it. Some trinkets worth a few pounds. And some War Office documents. I shouldn’t like to lose them. They deal with naval bases on this coast. Half the lochs on this part of the coast, you know, are seaplane or submarine bases.\n\n“Look here, we’d better go to the study to see if they’re still safe,” added the Colonel anxiously.\n\n“I think we had,” agreed Hawke, and they quickly made their way to the study. The Colonel switched on the light and crossed to a picture which he removed, disclosing the safe behind. Swiftly he dialled the combination, and in a moment the door swung back. Then the Colonel gave a sigh of relief.\n\n“Thank heaven, they’re still here,” he said, turning over the documents in his hand.\n\n“I suggest,” said Hawke quietly, “that an attempt to steal the documents is at the bottom of our mystery. The thief must have been interrupted before he actually got to work on the safe. He counted on escaping detection as the murderer of Miss Corry, and  hoped to carry out the theft of the plans later. He calculated that it would be safer not to go on with his original intention of securing them to-night.”\n\nHawke knocked out his pipe in the fireplace and began to refill it, pacing slowly up and down the room.\n\n“I see it all now,” he mused.\n\n“When he heard that the lights were to be switched off at the main he decided that this was as good a chance as any. People would be moving about all over the house, and he would be able to move himself with a certain amount of freedom. He went down to the study. Five minutes would have been enough for him. I fancy he is an expert. But, unfortunately, Jane Corry decided to do what Mary Gillies did later — to hide in the cloakroom. That’s a sound enough supposition. And perhaps she saw a light flicker beneath the study door and went in to investigate.\n\n“She saw at a glance what was happening. With admirable presence of mind she grabbed your Purdy from its place on the wall. But she had no chance in the darkness — once he had switched off his torch. I’ve no doubt he had one. He closed with her and tore away the gun. They struggled. He had her by the throat to prevent her crying out. But he was too rough, and before he knew it — murder would be the last thing he wanted — she was dead.”\n\n“Who the devil are you talking about?” demanded the Colonel.\n\nHawke scarcely seemed to hear him. He was piecing together the whole incident in his mind, and thinking aloud.\n\n“He thought desperately. His only chance was to make it look like suicide. But he had very little time. He carried her through to the cloakroom. Tied her to the hook as we found her and threw a coat over her. A silly thing to do, but the natural inclination to conceal the body was too strong. Then he went back to the study to clear up the traces of disturbance. The tobacco jar had been smashed in the struggle. He gathered up the pieces, perhaps straightened a rug, and put your Purdy back in its place. Then he found her shoe. He was about to go and put it on her. But something interrupted him. Hugh’s shout, doubtless, as he was being ‘murdered’ He didn’t know what it meant. But he had a shrewd idea that the lights would go on before long. He wasted no time. His quickest way of escape was upstairs and down to the servants’ quarters by the service stair. On the way he thought of returning the incriminating shoe to its owner’s bedroom. That would heighten, if anything, the appearance of suicide. But he made a mistake and put it in the wrong bedroom. Then he went down to the servants’ quarters. It fits the facts exactly, Colonel. And I think Tommy will be able to cap it.”\n\n“As I said before, Hawke,” said the Colonel in a tone of exasperation, “who the devil are you talking about?” Hawke looked at him in surprise.\n\n“I thought you were following, Mac. I’m talking about. Charles, of course. Don’t you understand? Do you remember the way he scooped up that glass by the stem between two fingers? He thought we were trying to get his finger-prints. And though he probably used gloves, while he was at work in the study, he picked the glass up so that it wouldn’t give any prints. That suggests that he’s an old hand.\n\n“Moreover, it was with his left hand that he picked it up. Simply because he’s left-handed. And what better job could you think of than that of a ship’s steward for bringing a man in touch with people who would — well, who would be interested in these naval and air bases?”\n\n“But, Hawke, he’s been in my employment before. Why should I suspect him? I remember him distinctly. I remember his face, anyhow.”\n\n“Probably from a Scotland Yard circular,” said Hawke. “And when you played into his hands by asking if he’d been with you before, he did the obvious thing.”\n\n“I see,” said the Colonel slowly. “But I’m still not quite clear about — “\n\nHe was interrupted by the sound — muffled, as though from a distant part of the house — of two pistol shots in quick succession.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nA Short-lived Escape\n\nHawke sprang to the door, calling to the Colonel:\n\n“Quick! The servants’ quarters. Which way?”\n\n“This way,” shouted the Colonel, and he brushed past Hawke and made for the stairs.\n\nThey took the stairs two at a time, sprinted down a corridor, with the sergeant and one of the constables at their heels, bundled down another flight of stairs and along a tiled passage.\n\nGraham, the butler, met them at a door at the far end. He was shaking with fright. He pointed to a spiral stair that led up to the servants’ bedrooms.\n\n“Up there, sir! “ he gasped.\n\nHawke brushed him aside, but before he had reached the foot of the stair Tommy appeared from above and clattered down. He was wildly dishevelled, and his jacket was torn.\n\n“He’s got away, guv’nor,” he shouted hoarsely. “He came in when I was searching and tried to brain me with a chair. He got away by a fire-escape. I was following when he took a couple of pot-shots at me. I thought I’d better get hold of you. He can’t go far.”\n\n“Is it there?” Hawke asked.\n\nTommy nodded. “It’s in his room. Up this way.”\n\nHe led the way up the stair to a small, severely-furnished room. The bottom drawer of a small chest of drawers had been pulled out, and lying on the top of a pile of disordered clothing were the broken pieces of Colonel MacIntyre’s tobacco jar.\n\nHawke pulled out the other drawers rapidly, and in one of them he found an expensive camera, a couple of spare lenses, and some odd pieces of photographic apparatus. He gave a grunt of satisfaction.\n\n“H’m. If he’d had any luck, you’d never have known anything about it, Colonel. He’d have photographed your papers and returned them to the safe.”\n\nHe went to the window and threw it up. It looked out over the dark waters of the loch. The moon was hidden by a bank of cloud.\n\nFaintly out of the darkness came the sound of an outboard motor-boat.\n\n“His plans have been laid for an emergency apparently,” said Hawke. “There’s a little bay on the far shore of the loch. The road runs quite close to it. A car was parked there the other day when we passed, and if I’m not mistaken that’s where he’s making for. Get the Bentley out, Tommy.”\n\nFive minutes later the big car was roaring down the road from Glen Erradale House, with Hawke himself at the wheel. The surface was bad, but Hawke was a fine driver and they kept up a steady speed.\n\nAfter a couple of miles he drew into the side and stepped out.\n\n“Carry on, Tommy,” he snapped. “You and the Colonel go on by road until you come to the parked car. The sergeant and I will cut across the moor. I don’t know which way will be the quicker, and we can’t risk losing him.”\n\nTommy slipped into the driving-seat, and the Bentley drew away. Hawke led the way across the rough heather until it dipped down to the black water. Then they circled round by the shore, going silently on the grass by its verge.\n\nHawke was listening intently. No sound broke the stillness, save the whisper of a breeze in the sedges down at the water’s edge.\n\nThen they heard the sound of an outboard motor-boat. Hawke gripped the sergeant’s arm, and they dropped where they stood.\n\nAfter a few moments the boat materialised out of the darkness, the motor was switched off, and the vessel glided towards the shore, grounding on the shingle. Like a dark shadow a man scrambled out and began to run up the hill. He was within a yard of them when Hawke rose to his feet and closed.\n\nThe man fought like a tiger. The sergeant ran forward to help, tripped, and went full-length. The murderer’s foot found the side of his chest, and he groaned and rolled down the slope towards the beach.\n\nHawke held on grimly, waiting his chance. It came; there was a sharp, clean snap as Hawke’s fist connected with his jaw, and Charles dropped in the heather without a sound.\n\nHawke ran lightly down to the beach to help the bruised and winded sergeant to his feet and send him to bring back Colonel MacIntyre and Tommy with the car for their prisoner.\n\n~THE END~\n"

He was certain his gift of gab would do the trick. He climbed the porch and rang the bell, smiling faintly.\n\nLeslie Jordan opened the door, gazed at him in surprise for a moment, then invited him in. Wilson found himself in a clean, well-kept living room. The room was warm and Wilson felt the sweat break out on his forehead. He loosened his collar with a huge forefinger.\n\n“I guess you think I’m a rat,” Wilson said as Jordan offered him a chair.\n\nJordan’s eyes were cold.\n\n“After what I saw this afternoon, what else can I think?” Wilson could sense Jordan’s dislike growing deeper every second. “But it didn’t come as a surprise,” Jordan continued. “I suspected you were cheating on your wife a year ago.”\n\nWilson took out a white silk handkerchief and wiped the sweat off his forehead. He kept his eyes fixed on Jordan, probing for a weakness. Jordan was middle-aged, with a thin austere face and a body so skinny that it made Wilson think of an undernourished child. Unconsciously Wilson compared the strength in his own huge body with Jordan’s weakness. He had noticed the look of grudging admiration that flitted over Jordan’s face at the sight of his broad shoulders and trim hips.\n\nWilson said, “Suppose I did cheat on my wife — does that make me an ogre?”\n\nInstantly Wilson realized his words were a mistake. He could sense Jordan’s disgust. Jordan had gone to an easel, taken up a paint brush which he had been twirling rapidly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. As soon as Wilson spoke, the twirling stopped. Jordan threw him a quick glance.\n\n“I don’t know what you call a man who cheats on his dying wife,” he said. “Ogre seems a hit mild.”\n\nHe daubed the brush in purple paint and added a faint shadow to the canvas he was working on.\n\n“You don’t mind if I work, do you? This piece has to be in the hands of my agent tomorrow morning. A commercial artist lives by the clock, you know.”\n\nHe added four swift strokes to the canvas and two large crosses appeared against a background of two struggling figures.\n\n“I’m doing an illustration for a new movie,” he continued. “It seems to fit in with our conversation. The picture’s named ‘Double Cross’.”\n\nDouble Cross! Someday this little punk would go too far with his name-calling and his moral snobbery and Wilson would break his skinny neck.\n\nWilson licked his lips.\n\n“Okay, so I’m a rat. But why kill your sister to get at me?”\n\nWilson was a fluent talker. He made it sound reasonable. What happened to himself was unimportant. But surely Jordan must realize that Mary was in no conditon to stand a severe shock. The news of her husband’s infidelity would kill her just as surely as a bullet.\n\n“Under the circumstances can you afford to tell her?”\n\n“Yes!”\n\nJordan kept his brush busy, pausing only now and then to get a fresh perspective on the painting, then plunging back to work again. The canvas had come alive. Two figures, locked in a life and death struggle, slowly came to life in the shadows cast by the giant crosses.\n\n“Her death will be on your hands.”\n\n“Aren’t you the one who did the cheating?”\n\nWilson bit his lower lip.\n\n“Spoken like a true bigot,” he said. “If this is your moral code, you can keep it.”\n\nHe swallowed hard, then added, “You don’t love your sister — all you love is your own bigotry.”\n\n“You’re a fine one to talk about love.”\n\nWilson hesitated. He had never expected Jordan would cling to his scruples even if it meant the death of someone he loved dearly. But there was no doubt of it. Jordan’s face was like a chunk of granite in its frozen determination.\n\nEven before he spoke, Wilson knew the answer to his next question: “But at least you’ll wait a few weeks — till she’s a little stronger?”\n\n“I’m going to tell her this afternoon.”\n\nHis face twisted in disgust and he avoided Wilson’s eyes.\n\nWilson cursed under his breath. He was beaten. What could he do now? In despair he heard Jordan saying:\n\n“You’re trying to picture my sister as a whimpering coward — but you see, Wilson, I know her well enough to realize she’d rather face the truth, no matter how bitter, than continue to live in a fool’s paradise.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nHalf A Million Dollars\n\nThere went a half-million dollars!\n\nGone! The chance of a lifetime, because of one small indiscretion. All his work, all his scheming would count for nothing. From now on he would have to sweat for his money like the rest of the chumps.\n\nWhat made it really hurt, though, was that it had to happen now, on the eve of success. Only yesterday the doctor told him that the cancer had gotten out of hand and Mary would die in less than six months. Six months more — one hundred and eighty days — and he would have been rolling in money, sole heir to his wife’s fortune.\n\nWhat a fool he had been to take up with that little blonde! He should have waited. Six months from now he could have gotten a thousand dolls like her — just by whistling.\n\nHelpless rage tore at him as he stared at Jordan. This meddling fool was going to shoot off his mouth and ruin everything. He stood there like a little tin god, with his nose about a foot in the air, and thought he could pass judgment on his betters. Wilson fought desperately for self-control. At least he wouldn’t give Jordan the satisfaction of —\n\n“You never loved my sister,” Jordan was saying. “You’ve simply hung around like a vulture waiting for her to die so you could squander her money.”\n\n“You dirty — “ The words stuck in Wilson’s throat. Blood was hammering, in his ears. His hands closed into tight fists.\n\n“But you couldn’t wait till she was dead.”\n\n“Shut up! I’ll — “\n\nThrough a red haze, Wilson saw Jordan’s face twist in loathing. He was on his feet before he realized it. His fist smacked on Jordan’s cheek bone.\n\nJordan spun sideways, then thudded to the floor. Blood spurted from a gash in his cheek. Wilson threw himself on Jordan’s body and smashed it with all the power in his 225 pounds.\n\nJordan threw his arms around Wilson’s back, trying to draw him close enough to smother those sledge-hammer blows. Wilson struggled to free his arms, then suddenly his fingers were around Jordan’s throat.\n\nJordan’s hands beat a brief tattoo on Wilson’s back; then after a moment they were still.\n\nWilson let his fingers relax on Jordan’s throat. He got to his feet. His mind refused to grasp what had happened. He kept staring at that twisted body on the floor. Then all at once he realized … MURDER!\n\nHe fought down a panic-stricken impulse to run. That would never do. His fingerprints were all over the place and quite possibly he had dropped something during the struggle.\n\nHe must be calm. Think! Think! Suddenly he remembered that no one had seen him enter the building a half-hour before. It would be a simple matter to erase his fingerprints, leave the apartment without being seen … . Then who could prove he’d ever been there?\n\nHe whipped out his handkerchief. Within five minutes he’d gone over everything in the apartment he could possibly have touched. Then he dropped to his hands and knees and examined every inch of the floor. Now that he had decided on a course of action he was calm, and as he straightened up a smile creased the corners of his mouth. Perhaps it was better like this after all. Jordan would never get in his hair again.\n\nHe put on his hat, took one last look around. Satisfied, he let himself out of the apartment, making sure that the safety lock clicked behind him.\n\nLuck was with him. The elevator was not in use, and a few seconds later he found himself on the ground floor. Now came the tough part. The door of the elevator was solid steel and he had no way of knowing what lay outside in the foyer.\n\nHe took a deep breath, jerked open the door and stepped through — right into the arms of a tall, heavy-set man in a blue serge suit.\n\n“Something wrong?” The heavy-set man eyed Wilson suspiciously.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nDouble Cross\n\nThere was only one thing Wilson could do.\n\n“I suppose it’s really nothing,” he bluffed, “but an hour ago I got a call from my brother-in-law, Mr. Jordan. He asked me to rush over right away. Said it was important and to tell the truth he did sound a bit upset. And now — when he doesn’t answer his doorbell … .”\n\nThe heavy-set man rubbed his chin thoughtfully.\n\n“I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to check. I’m the manager here and of course 1 have a pass key.”\n\nAt the door of Jordan’s apartment, the manager took a ring of keys from his pocket and chose one. He pushed open the door.\n\n“My lord!” The manager froze.\n\nJordan’s body lay exactly as Wilson had left it. Sightless eyes glared up at the ceiling. The lingers curved like the claws of a beast ready to spring. And the lips, torn and bloody, curled luck in a silent snarl.\n\nWilson fumbled for the telephone.\n\n“Get me policy headquarters,” he stammered, and the horror in his voice was real enough. Before his mind’s eye flashed the picture of a hangman’s noose.\n\n*   *   *   *   *\n\nThe police sergeant was big and beefy and he chewed a black cigar. He had just come out of Jordan’s apartment and joined Wilson and the manager in the hallway, where they had waited ever since the police arrived. Inside the apartment, a squad of detectives methodically turned the rooms upside down.\n\nThe sergeant carried a black notebook in his hand.\n\n“You were saying a little while ago that Jordan was in some kind of trouble ?”\n\n“Just a rumor,” Wilson said reluctantly. “Jordan was supposed to have been playing around with some fellow’s wife, but of course I don’t believe it. Jordan — “\n\n“Never mind what you believe,” the sergeant interrupted. “What else did you hear?”\n\n“It’s really a lot of talk … .Well, anyway, this fellow was supposed to have threatened Jordan’s life.”\n\nThe sergeant looked up.\n\n“Who?”\n\n“I did catch a glimpse of him one afternoon on the street.”\n\nWilson dipped into his imagination and drew forth a complete man. He made it convincing. No longer was he afraid. This dumb cop was going for his story hook, line and sinker. For a few months they would look for this mythical man, send out his phony description to every police station in the country; then they would forget about the case and file it away in the “forever file.” Another unsolved murder!\n\n“I understand this fellow drifted into town a few weeks ago,” Wilson was saying. “He was a gambler, I believe. Came from somewhere back east.”\n\nThe sergeant wrote something in his notebook.\n\n“Anyway Jordan met him at a card game.”\n\nWilson took off his overcoat and laid it across the banister. It was hot and stuffy in the narrow hallway and he was beginning to sweat profusely.\n\n“Then Jordan met this fellow’s wife,” he continued, “and — well, you know the rest of the story. I still can’t believe he’s — “\n\nSuddenly Wilson realized something was wrong.\n\nThe sergeant had stopped writing In his little red notebook. He stood staring at Wilson with an odd look in his eyes. “Would you mind turning around again?”\n\n“What’s this, a gag?”\n\nWilson’s face was calm but inside his chest his heart pounded like a jackhammer. Something was wrong — but what? He slowly turned his back to the sergeant.\n\nBehind him the sergeant suddenly chuckled. “You know for a moment you had me convinced.”\n\n“What do you mean?” Wilson spun around.\n\n“Take off your suit coat and look at the back of it.”\n\nWilson tore off his coat On the back of it were several streaks of lurid red paint. The streaks were broken and faltering, as if drawn by a shaky hand.\n\n“I forgot to tell you,” the sergeant said, “we found a paint brush in Jordan’s hand.”\n\nWilson’s mind raced back to the fight. Suddenly he remembered how Jordan’s arms had been around his body, how Jordan had clawed at his back. That cursed paint brush! Jordan had kept it clutched in his hand during the struggle. Wilson groaned. He’d been too busy erasing his fingerprints to notice the brush.\n\nThe sergeant stared at the red streaks for a moment, then drew out his handcuffs.\n\n“It’s funny,” he said, “those streaks on the back of your coat form a couple of rough crosses.”\n\nHe laughed.\n\n“Double Cross.”\n\n~ The End ~\n"

      "content_html": "LINCOLN, ILLINOIS —\n\nA burglar leaving with a load of copper wire under his arm was suddenly dazzled by the flash of an exploding bulb. Quickly he wrecked the photographic apparatus attached to the bulb, only to learn to his chagrin that this had been a “dummy” and that his photograph had been taken by a concealed camera.\n\n\n\nBOLIVIA, SOUTH AMERICA —\n\nThis country doesn’t hold that, though two men have been convicted as equally guilty of the murder of a third, both should die. The “anfora reos,” (criminal vase) contains several balls, one black. And when Francisco Mamani drew this black ball, he alone atoned with his life for the murder of Domingo Quispe, while his confederate in the murder, Julio Zagarra, escaped the death sentence.\n\n\n\nMARIETTA, OHIO —\n\nA jail background did not lessen the prestige or make him less desirable as a guardian of the peace, decided fellow citizens of John Arthur Dunn. And though he had fifteen rivals, Mr. Dunn, in jail serving out a fine of $25 and costs imposed when he pleaded guilty to petit larceny, was elected a constable of Marietta township.\n\n\n\nHUNGARY, EUROPE —\n\nCaricaturists usually depict criminals with flat heads, shifty eyes and low-slung ears. But scientists protest there is no generally accepted type so easily recognize . Yet recently Police Councillor Max Tisza of Miskolc, Hungary, after making an extensive study of convicts has decided that one group rarely, if ever, goes in for law breaking of any kind. People with dimples are immune from such impulses.\n\nDimples show a high standard of morality, says this criminologist, based on his contact with a variety of burglars, embezzlers, defrauders and murderers. Dimples are a trademark of honesty. Usually.\n\n\n\nKINGWOOD, WEST VIRGINIA —\n\nSheriff Carl Roth of this community will henceforth have a kind word to say for the men in his care. Last winter while taking three prisoners from the jail to the courthouse the sheriff slipped on the ice, broke a leg, lay helpless. His prisoners might have made a break. What did they do? Instead they toted the sheriff to the courthouse and helped rush him to a hospital.\n\n\n\nKANSAS CITY, MO. —\n\nAnyway, it is some consolation to Tavern Keeper John Girard to know that the burglars who stole 84 bottles from his display were headed for a great disappointment. For the bottles, instead of containing beer as their labels promised, were filled with tea-tinted water!\n\n\n\nDARTMOUTH PRISON, ENGLAND —\n\nEven London, with its blackout and bombs, is a more cheerful place than Dartmouth Prison, complain warders transferred from the city to the prison house isolated on the moors. They have no “bright life,” complain twenty-five of the warders who have organized to agitate for brighter prisons.\n\n\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS —\n\nHold-up men were responsible for more than one half the jaw fractures treated at Hines Memorial Hospital during the past seven and a half years, says Dr. C. M. Logson in an article in the March issue of the Journal of the American Dental Association. Automobiles come second on this list as jaw-breakers.\n\n\n\nNASHVILLE, TENNESSEE —\n\nOverweight is seldom an asset. But a defendant in a local court on a lottery charge came up before a judge who, deciding the 520 pounds of flesh carried by Preseton Taylor, a negro, a guarantee he would not try to run away, released him without bail.\n\n“I know you can’t run fast enough to get away,” commented the Judge.\n\n\n\nBUDAPEST, HUNGARY —\n\nThe number thirteen, held unlucky by the superstitious, turned out to be Just that for one Paul Fazekas, who specialized in poisoning his relatives by putting arsenic in the flour used by the women folks. He was born on a 13th, the three murders he committed were each carried out on a 13th, he was arrested on a 13th, sentenced on a 13th and was hanged-on last July 13th.\n\n\n\nSALT LAKE CITY, UTAH —\n\nEven bandits have principles and prejudices. Recently Arthur West, owner of a service station, was held up.\n\n“Is this station one of a chain system?” asked the bandit, as he ordered West to open the till.\n\n“It’s mine,” answered West.\n\nThe bandit put his revolver away.\n\n“I need the money bad,” he told the astonished man, “but I wouldn’t rob a private owner.”\n\nAnd walked out.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  You Don’t Know Anything About Me\n  The Eyes\n  The Park Killer\n  Warm Sun, Blue Sky; Blue As Your Eyes\n  Shooting the Heart\n  Miles Away In The Darkness\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nYou Don’t Know Anything About Me\n\nThe girl on the park bench moved restlessly. Every few seconds she would turn her head and stare away down the long gravel walk — that brown line along whose either side sat the wearied, the hopeless, the migratory. As the flame of a candle, caught by wandering airs, flickers up and down, so fear played in her eyes — deep, dark-brown eyes, a richness and warmth that told of emotions unplumbed. This was a girl of possibilities; she might be anything, might do anything. At this moment, however, she was openly nervous, abstracted, fearfully expectant — all this, while the young and exasperated man beside her was asking her to marry him!\n\nTo outward view, at least, he offered no reason why the brown-eyed girl should not listen most breathlessly to his tale. His body was normal and pleasing to the eye; his clothes were neat and well chosen; and his finely shaped head and high brow advertised intelligence and plenty of it. But his eyes were what first caught the interest of observers; and soon made good their promise of charming. Blue — blue they were — clear and true and pure; a blue that is the sign of power of thought and sanity of soul; a blue that dares and does.\n\nPerhaps the depth of brown eyes shrank from the penetration of blue; but certainly the now peevish young man had no such thought.\n\n“Oh, cut it out, will you?” he frowned. “Every time I coax you into the park you’re about as quiet and restful as a pinwheel. Sit still! Do you know I’m asking you to marry me?”\n\n“But Jim,” she said, even then turning from him, and watching anxiously the long gravel path, “you don’t know anything about me — except my first name, and — “\n\n“I’m getting so I’m not sure of that,” he muttered.\n\n“And I — I wish you wouldn’t,” she ended; and the deeps of the brown eyes flashed to the blue a look of mingled yearning and terror.\n\nFor a fleeting moment Jim Dean felt a prickling fear and a strange wonder as he saw the terror and a thrill of surging longing as he sensed her yearning. Then it all passed and he remembered only his grievance.\n\n“Great snakes, Hester,” he said childishly, “anybody’d think I was about as inviting a prospect for a husband as that poor bum over there!”\n\nHester hastily glanced at the wreck of a man on the bench opposite. From the listless heap of sunken body and tattered clothing glowed a pair of black eyes.\n\n“I wish you did look like him,” she answered sincerely.\n\n“What!” Dean sat up, amazed.\n\n“I know you don’t understand. And I can’t explain. But if you did look like him I wouldn’t be so afraid that — “\n\nShe broke off, clutching him. Again Dean felt the stab of emotion — a sharp, formless warning of danger, he followed her straining glance. All that caught his eye were two persons coming up the walk, a young woman interested in getting somewhere quickly, and far back of her a short, fat man strolling leisurely up the middle of the gravel.\n\n“What the — “ he began disgustedly.\n\nSuddenly she swung full to him, and Dean saw that the smoldering fear in her eyes had shot to a pleading, flaming panic. Her fingers dug into his arm, and her voice dropped to a low, fierce whisper.\n\n“Jim — let’s go! Anywhere but here!” She shook his arm, the while glancing over her shoulder. “Jim — it’s he! Oh, I knew it — I was a fool ever to come here! Jim — Jim — hurry! I can’t tell why, but there’s awful danger! He’ll spot you the first thing! Jim — you say you love me — then come!”\n\nDean crossed his legs comfortably, stuffed his hands in his pockets, and smiled invitingly toward the fat man, still far down the path. He was happier than he had been for weeks.\n\n“My dear, my greatest hope in life is that he will spot me. If he doesn’t, I’ll introduce myself. Maybe he’ll let in some light on my darkened brain and — “\n\nAn ill-suppressed cry from her interrupted him.\n\n“Don’t say that!” she exclaimed, rising, and pulling at him.\n\nHe grunted derisively and jerked his arm away.\n\n“That howl of yours, without any sense or reason, is just a sample of what I’ve been up against for three months. Nothing from you but mystery and fidgets and an everlasting order for me to stay out of this park. I tell you I won’t go and I’m sick — “\n\n“Jim,” she interrupted, “you’re a fool not to listen. But I’ve got to run. I don’t dare be seen with you. If you love me, do this — it’s your only chance. Don’t look at him — read your paper — pull your hat over your eyes — anything. I’ll be back after he’s gone. Remember — don’t look at him!”\n\nShe hurried off across the grass.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Eyes\n\nDean didn’t even glance to see where she had gone. He took his hands out, but only to throw his paper away and take his hat off. Then, with keen, alert blue eyes, he watched the fat man.\n\nThe bum on the opposite bench stirred, and for the first time in half an hour seemed interested. The black eyes took on an added glow as the short, chunky figure waddled nearer.\n\nDean scanned the man closely. He guessed the fat person was about fifty, and that he had a surplus of flesh even on his tongue. The flabbiest, most jellied creature he had ever seen, he thought — until he noticed the hands. Enormous, gigantic in both length and breadth, with fingers long, narrow, a musician’s fingers; the hands were never still.\n\nAs the lower arms of a wooden toy are pulled by a string, his arms moved back and forth automatically, with the live, sensitive fingers restlessly feeling — feeling delicately, inquiringly, if they had eyes in the tips and searched endlessly for something they momentarily expected to touch and grasp.\n\nThe sight of them reminded Dean of crawling bugs and the feelers of insects; and he experienced a slight, but definite, aversion.\n\nWhen the rotund being with the quivering antennae had rolled to within fifty feet, Dean forgot the fat and the fingers in the wonder of the face. Cut deep into the wabbly rolls of flesh was the widest and most fixed smile Dean had ever seen. And as he stared, and half wondered at and half despised the shrinking within himself he hoped he’d never see another like it.\n\nThe slit was as if one had taken a short, curved sword and slashed into a shapeless mass of dead face that lacked a mouth; and had given it a mouth and a smile — a smile that would have made a child run shrieking to its mother.\n\nAs the squat figure arrived on a line with Dean and the bum, he cut his ridiculously short steps to almost nothing. From one side black eyes glared at him under the brim of a veteran felt hat; from the other watched the clearest and finest of blue eyes, open, curious. The fat man handed the bum the merest speeding glance. He turned and gave Dean a direct, examining look — and came to a decisive halt.\n\nDean met the eyes — tiny eyes almost lost in the hanging, flapping flesh — pig’s eyes. Against his will his hair bristled and his fingers clenched. The dots of eyes seemed blue — maybe they were green — even a gray — Dean wasn’t sure which. He was more interested, with a sort of repellent fascination, in their expression — or was it a total absence of meaning that held him?\n\n“A lovely day,” said the fat man, in cold, monotonous tones — and laughed. The face undulated; the body quivered. “Very jolly!”\n\n“Right,” answered Dean, briefly, but not rudely. He didn’t like the smiling pile of flesh; but it undoubtedly was connected with the mystery of Hester, and so merited attention.\n\nThe man advanced toward him, shaking with ingratiating good nature. Dean wished the gimlet eyes would waver, if only for a restful second. And those snaky fingers!\n\n“Wonderful eyes!” continued the dead voice. “Perfect! Yes, yes, most unusual! And a fine head!”\n\nThe waving fingers darted up toward Dean, and as suddenly down. Dean felt like dodging.\n\n“Excuse me! Nervous, old man! Lovely day — beautiful eyes — clever young man — all fine! Oh, quite jolly!” And with another wide gesture expressive of apology, he slid away, his flesh fairly tumbling with laughter, and fingers feeling about with frantic rapidity.\n\nDean and the bum gazed after him, crawling up the path. Dean was glad, yet sorry to see him go. The man was a horror; but he meant something in Hester’s life, and should have been encouraged to sit down and talk. As he rebuked himself, the bum slouched to his feet and stepped toward Dean. Then he saw something behind the young man, and fell back.\n\nThe bum had seen Hester returning. She slid into the seat beside Dean, with a quick, panicky glance at the back of the slowly departing fat man.\n\n“Jim,” she reprimanded him, “you stubborn — Oh, why didn’t you do as I told you? I saw him stop here. Tell me — what did he say?”\n\n“Oh, he was a fine old chap,” said Dean, lying, still vexed with himself, and, of course, with her. “Good-natured, with a smile a mile wide. Said it was a jolly day, and made a fuss over my perfect blue — “\n\n“I told you! Oh, I told you not to look at him!” exclaimed Hester, in an agony of reproach and fear. “Jim, there is just one way to be safe — promise me you’ll take it! Stay out of this park, Jim, that’s all — please!”\n\n“More likely to move in here,” muttered Dean. “I’m not going to sit around any more and watch you jump. I’m going to find out what’s the matter with you, since you won’t trust me and tell — “\n\n“I can’t!”\n\n“Well, you can tell me what this man is to you!” he said angrily. “He isn’t your — “\n\nHe broke off.\n\n“You wouldn’t play with me that way, would you, Hester?” he ended, his anger subsiding.\n\nFor a sweet moment the brown eyes filled with longing. Fear was forgotten.\n\n“Oh, Jim boy, I wish I could ask you to help, for I’m in an awful place. But you’d only hurt. There, he’s reached the end of the path and is coming back! How I hate him! But I must get in before he does! Oh!”\n\nShe shot a look at Dean. He suspected she had said something impulsive, not meant for him.\n\n“Good-by. And, for your life, stay out of the park, Jim,” adding, with a pleading smile, “dear!”\n\nMore baffled than ever, Dean watched the lithe, graceful girl cut diagonally across the park to the nearest street. Suddenly he became aware of the bum standing over him.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Park Killer\n\n“Say, young feller,” drawled the battered owner of the piercing black eyes, “I dunno what that young lady was throwin’ into you, but I bet she was tippin’ you off on that fat slob. Now, I ain’t got nothin’ against him, an’ dunno nothin’ about him, but I’m plumb scared o’ him, an’ so are mah pals. Most of the park calls him ‘The Laughing Man,’ but us select gents of leisure — well, to us he’s ‘The Park Killer.’\n\n“Of course we dunno,” he continued, with a sidelong glance up the path, “but we think he did for several of our bunch. Only yesterday my own pal vanished — a good old scout he was, with the reddest hair and the bluest eyes ever. Blue as yours, they were. The last I saw o’ him he was sittin’ on a bench, gabbin’ with that oily, chucklin’ corpse. He’s sneakin’ down on us now. So long, pard, and excuse — I just thought I’d back up the young lady.”\n\n“Much obliged,” replied Dean, cordially, not knowing what else to say. “Guess I’ll wander out with you. I didn’t take to him, either.”\n\nDown the gravel they walked — at a fair pace — the black-eyed bum, and the blue-eyed young man, both fleeing from a smile, though one frankly admitted it and the other did not. And most of Dean’s thinking concerned the fate of the red-head and the meaning of Hester’s “I must get in before he does!”\n\nFor three days Dean neither saw Hester nor heard from her. Her custom had been to telephone him that she would be at a certain corner or drug store at a certain time; all their meetings had been arranged that way. What he hated most was that she would never let him take her home; she always had stopped at one of several corners and had told him to be a nice boy and run along. And now, even of that silly dismissal, there was no more. All he knew was that he loved the most maddening, baffling girl that ever drew a man with, her dark eyes, and that apparently she had vanished from the earth.\n\nThen, by chance, he glimpsed her walking fast through the twilight. His impulse was to run to her. Instead, he trailed her. In a little side street, one of a row of dark, secretive houses — all of a kind — swallowed her. Dean noted the street and number, and was turning away, when a thought stopped him.\n\nUnder cover of a deserted doorway, he watched a half hour — to have his patience rewarded by the sight of a man silently disappearing into the same house which hid Hester. It was the fat man!\n\n“I must get in before he does,” rang again in Dean’s ears. And he knew there was but one thing to do — the only way to settle his doubts and fears; and that was to go into that house.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nWarm Sun, Blue Sky; Blue As Your Eyes\n\nThe very next day, therefore, a young man, whose clothes cried for extensive repairing and whose manner indicated that he had abandoned all hope, sat on a park bench and turned a nice blue eye, now and then, on the length of the gravel walk. He ceased even this mild interest as a fat, smiling man took a snail’s pace up the path. With body slumped, the young man stared dully into space. His only movement pushed his shapeless hat back from his eyes.\n\nThe fat man paused directly in line with the brooding eyes. Slowly the blue eves rose and m%t the bright, steely points of the other. The doughy, pendulous mass of the face wabbled with laughter.\n\n“My young man with the beautiful eyes,” droned the hard voice. “Very jolly! May I?”\n\nHis seemingly boneless bulk melted onto the bench, bringing altogether too near the playing fingers and that inhuman grinning cut.\n\n“Remember me?” The emotionless sound went on. “Name’s Rudah. Like you — liked you the other day. Wonderful eyes — oh, jolly! See you’re in hard luck. What’s the matter?”\n\n“Same old tale,” muttered Dean, shuddering within at the close contact. “Gambled — was fired — sold even my clothes to pay my debts. And now I’m a bum — own all the time there is and nothing else.”\n\n“That’s quite jolly — tough, I mean! Never mind — everything’ll be happy yet. Yes, yes! How about a job with me? I’m a scientist — want a man to keep my stuff in order. Everything lovely, eh?”\n\n“Sure.” Dean agreed quickly. Then, fearing he might have been too eager: “Oh, I don’t know. I’m no good — what’s the use?”\n\n“Be jolly — lots of use — very useful to me! Any relatives?” Rudah’s laughing question made Dean swallow — he knew not why.\n\n“Not a soul,” he said brazenly. “Glad of it now.”\n\n“Fine — fine! — Come right along!\n\n“Perfect day,” was Rudah’s comment as the two rose, and Rudah started off with a celerity Dean had thought impossible for the ducklike waddle. “Warm sun, blue sky; blue as your eyes!”\n\nThe fat man’s speed and happiness increased as they approached their destination. Everything was lovely; even the hot sun, almost down now, was jolly. But Dean could not class his laughter as contagious; and kept his eyes from the flowing fatness beside him, and his thoughts on Hester.\n\nNeither man ever looked behind him, and so did not see another following far in the rear — a man in ragged clothes and with smoldering fire in his black eyes.\n\n“Here we are! No palace — just a jolly place to work!” Rudah, chuckling, turned in where Dean knew he would — the same silent sepulcher of a place in which yesterday Hester had disappeared. Would she be in there? Would she see him — and if so, what would happen? He went up the stone steps after Rudah, every nerve high-strung, expecting anything.\n\nAs the door closed on them, the black-eyed bum sauntered by the house — then paused as if in uncertainty. In a moment he shook his head and started off slowly. He had the air of one in doubt.\n\nWithin the house, Dean felt that he was in a place in which there never had been a sound. Not a warm human whisper ever had confronted the ear; here was only a strong smell of chemicals and of old, musty coolness — an odor which meant rats and rotten flooring.\n\nHe almost jumped as Rudah’s living fingers touched his head. An electric shock thrilled him. It was as if the fingers had pressed on the very brain!\n\n“Pardon — just taking off your hat!” And Rudah dropped it on a dusty chair. Dean, still flooded with horror by the uncanny touch, felt that, oppressed though he was by this tomb, he must speak.\n\n“That’s all right,” he began lamely — but was cut short by a fearful scream, a sharp cry that split the house.\n\nDean’s eyes shot toward the floor above, and, through the gray twilight of the interior saw a face, white and wide-eyed with terror, leaning over the railing. The face vanished — but not before he had recognized it. It was Hester!\n\nWith speed miraculous for his bulk, the fat man already was ascending the stairs.\n\n“Just a minute,” he chanted over his shoulder calmly,” my wife — not well!”\n\nDean’s muscles had gathered to dart after him and to Hester, but at the words “my wife” a sickness clutched him, heart and throat, and he stared dumbly into the darkness above. His wife! So Hester had cheated him — made a jest of his manhood! The wife of this laughing fiend — this poisonous satyr!\n\nThe tension of the nerves snapped, and Dean dropped into the dusty chair. Not a sound in the house — though his cars still hurt and sang with that scream. A wave of recklessness and self-contempt swept over-him. Hester had tricked him; he was one more whom life and love had fooled; let the Park Killer —\n\nHe caught the sound of a key softly turning, and then the creaking of the old stairs as Rudah descended. The fat man advanced on him, bubbling with apology and cheerfulness.\n\n“All jolly now — yes, yes! She’s resting — lying down! Nervous, like me! This way,” paddling off down the long, dusky hallway; “want to show you your job. Yes, indeed” — a hideous gurgle — “you’ll be very useful!”\n\nUtterly careless of self, with scarcely a trace of curiosity as to what would befall him, Dean did as he was bid. At the end of the corridor, Rudah, with loathsome deference, ushered him into a totally dark room. Dean would have sworn that those long, writhing fingers — those grasping, sucking tentacles — played about his head. Instinctively he jerked away his head and put up his hands.\n\nBut only a light snapped on — and there was Rudah at the switch, a dozen feet away, laughing like a ghoul. Dean’s hands dropped and he sniffed at his childish fear of the dark.\n\n“Your job,” Rudah began. “See! Hooks in a mess, tools in a mess, bottles, jars — all in a fearful, jolly mess! You pick ‘em up keep ‘em in order. Easy, lovely job, eh?”\n\nDean nodded, agreeing more with the mess than with the ease of the job. Everything was in disorder; books scattered about, shelves of tubes and bottles in disarray, gleaming knives, scissors and other instruments here and there, a heavy stationary table in the middle of the room, and, over in a corner, a sort of table or bed on wheels, on top of which lay something covered with a cloth. Dean noticed that the window’s had been boarded up and that all the light came from powerful hanging globes. So strong was their combined force as to pain his eyes.\n\nNot knowing what else to do, and hoping that if anything were going to happen it would, hurry up, Dean began an investigatory stroll. With him went Rudah, explaining happily where everything belonged. Like incessant lightning the fingers vibrated, while the sickish, slashed face quavered like a disturbed quicksand.\n\n“He looks like a swamp,” thought Dean, sensing danger and glad of it. “What in thunder does he want with me — the grinning devil!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nShooting the Heart\n\nIn his tour, Dean came to the cloth-covered table in the corner. Impelled by some perverse desire and half suspecting what he would see, he drew back the cloth. Just behind him he could feel Rudah spilling with laughter.\n\nUnder the sheet lay a man. The eyes that stared unwinking up at the glaring lights were blue and strikingly clear; and the mop of hair and coarse beard were a dusty red.\n\n“Of course,” said Dean. Before him lay the black-eyed bum’s pal!\n\n“Jolly fellow — that!” Rudah, unruffled, informed him. “Used to have your job. Good man — lovely eyes — heavier than I thought, too!”\n\nDean gave these enigmatic and perhaps startling phrases little attention, suddenly having become interested in something about the farther side of the man’s head. He leaned over to see more clearly. As his eyes gazed upon the mutilated skull, his nerves telegraphed a subtle but sharp alarm and both brain and body prepared instantaneously to turn and defend him.\n\nBut he was too late. Giant’s lingers — irresistible bands of steel — were about his neck; and he knew, with his first agonizing struggle, that he could not turn and that his spark of life lay wholly at the mercy of this laughing, living death.\n\n“Easy! Easy! Everything’s jolly!” The cold, even, mirthless tones floated to Dean’s darkening consciousness. “Won’t hurt you — must have a bandage — glorious eyes — best I ever had! Oh, jolly!”\n\nAnd with a sort of silly, formless thought that Hester surely couldn’t love a monster like this, Dean fell swiftly into a pit of blackness.\n\nAs his spirit took hold on life again, he dreamed that soft, warm lips had just been lifted from his. Weakly he hoped that the dream would return. Consciousness flowed back stronger. Once more came the kiss — sweet, cleansing, driving blackness before it; and he knew it was no dream. Some one in the darkness — but why was it so dark? — was kissing him tenderly.\n\nGentle, woman hands passed healingly over his cheeks and bruised throat. He heard a wordless, soothing whispering. He strained his eyes; but could make out nothing. And yet, when that giggling beast had throttled him, the room had blazed with light. Had that flabby horror — Was — oh, was he blind!\n\nOf a sudden his lifted eyelashes shot a message to his brain, and a new tightness about his head confirmed his lightning suspicion. His eyes were bandaged. He remembered that, before darkness had swallowed him, Rudah had mentioned a bandage. Then he was not blind.\n\nBut — sickening reaction — if he were blind, surely he would be conscious of at least a faint glow from the flood of light, though the bandage were the thickest. With mind now painfully alert, he started to rise — and could not. For the first time, he realized his hands were bound!\n\nAs he moved, there floated to him a faint, thankful sigh. The next second, lips touched his ear and breathed low, trembing syllables.\n\n“Jim — why did you — oh, no time for that now! He locked me in, but I crawled out the transom. I’m going for help now. He’ll be back any minute. If he should shoot you, hold perfectly still, and you’ll be safe!”\n\nIn the darkness, Dean sneered. If you are shot, hold still, and you are magically invulnerable! A genial household, indeed!\n\n“Oh, don’t bother about me.” He spoke sullenly, not caring particularly whether Rudah heard him or not. “Let him shoot. Only — I’d like to flatten him out — the bloated, yellow thing — even if he is your — “\n\nHe broke off, suddenly feeling, as he shifted the position of his body, something strange.\n\n“What’s this thing on my chest? Hands tied, eyes bandaged, probably blind, too — and now here’s something pressing on my lung! What the dickens does this all mean?”\n\n“S — sh! I put it there!” He felt the tickle of her hair. “Good-by. Remember — if he shoots, don’t move!”\n\nGick! The lights flamed on, and Dean knew from the immediate rush of dimmed rays to his eyes that he was not blind!\n\nBeside him Hester caught her breath. And he could positively feel that swollen animal, standing by the electric switch, slopping with laughter. A thin-edged silence — then —\n\n“Ah! Sweethearts! Of course — your cry, my dear. Should have known it; brown-eyed women full of sentiment, but no brains. Still, you have been helpful. — must admit it. But no more — no more. Not so jolly now — bad, bad!”\n\nDean felt the floor shake as Rudah paced up and down, muttering to himself.\n\n“Untie my hands, you fat devil,” burst out Dean, “and I’ll make things jolly for you!”\n\nHester put a hand over his mouth.\n\n“Don’t,” she whispered. Then to Rudah, in tones hard, biting, with but the trace of a quiver: “You shall not have him — as you have the others!”\n\n“So?” Rudah did not cease his heavy glide. “But I will! Hands itch to get at him now!  Glorious eyes — splendid head! But you — you dark eyes! That’s the problem: — what — to — do — with — you. You love — and all love is foolish, useless; no love in the brain, just in the red heart. You are no good to me, now; can’t stay here, can’t go away. Meddlesome police here in no time. Dear, dear! And everything was so jolly!”\n\nFor a half minute there was quiet. Slowly an idea penetrated to Dean that Hester was in danger; and he tried to convince himself that he did not care. His test of self resulted in complete, admitted failure. He knew that always he would care.\n\nWithout warning, Hester made a rush for the door. Dean was fairly jolted as Rudah’s gigantic bulk moved to intercept her. He cursed his uselessness, and dragged himself to a sitting posture against the wall.\n\n“No — no — dear lady,” came in cold, merciless tones, “don’t go! May be useful yet! Oh, yes, yes! Why, this is fine — all jolly again! Why didn’t I think of this before?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nMiles Away In The Darkness\n\n“You fiend!” Hester’s voice was clear, furious. “If I hadn’t been such a fool as to scream, I’d have — “\n\n“Never mind; all lovely now! You are lovers. Brown eyes and blue — wonderful chance for comparing opposing types, eyes, brains! Yes, yes! never had such an opportunity! Both very valuable. Must get right at it!”\n\n“Go ahead,” Hester said coolly. “Only I warn you — twenty-four hours after you kill me, you yourself will be either dead or in prison!”\n\nHester to die! That foul, grinning death would kill his own wife just because she was mixed up in this silly rigmarole about blue eyes! He could die, he felt, almost carelessly, because love’s light for him had been darkened. But Hester — —!\n\nDean scrambled to his feet and stood, straight and strong, a defiant figure of young manhood, against the wall. He spoke — and his voice rose to an echoing crescendo of command and courage.\n\n“Kill me, you scum, but let her go! If you have tricked me here to get my eyes, why, take them! I admit I love her, and you, her husband, should! If you have the shadow of a soul, be kind to her. And for Heaven’s sake,” he said, drawing a deep breath, and throwing his bandaged head high, “take off this thing and let me die like a man!”\n\n“No — no.” Rudah chuckled. “Light would hurt beautiful eyes. But hold that position — please.”\n\nA sharp cry from Hester.\n\n“Makes a lovely shot!” “Jim — he’s going to shoot! Keep still — he always shoots the heart — you’re safe! Oh — Jim!”\n\nWith the flash of a thought that Hester must have gone, mad. Dean laughed wildly and rushed toward the spot whence had come the expressionless, evil voice. With hands tied, eyes darkened, and this puzzling weight on his chest, he felt helpless enough. His only desire before death should blast him was to hurl himself on that loathsome bulk and with drive of shoulder or kick of foot to hurt it. Oh, to flatten it — bury it — especially that laughing mask!\n\n“A jolly shot,” said Rudah — and fired.\n\nDean felt an awful shock — a weakening nausea — knew dimly that he had been shot over the heart. And for the second time in an hour, he slipped away into nothingness, his last impression being a sound of crashing, ripping boards.\n\nThe nothingness became something. From miles away in the darkness came a confused murmur; then a sharper tone of command; a sound of heavy bodies moving off. A rest — a pause while his vital forces gathered — and life and understanding flowed back.\n\nHe opened his eyes, and looked up into sweet mirrors of deepest brown, from which all fear had fled. His head was in Hester’s lap; his eyes and hands were free, and that mysterious weight over his heart was gone. He smiled.\n\n“You are safe, Hester?”\n\n“Yes — and for all time, I hope,” she said tremulously, “with you!”\n\n“With me!” The meaning in her words gave him strength to sit up. “What about Rudah, your husband?”\n\n“Jim — Jim! As if — That liar and murderer is now on the way to iron bars, where he has belonged for many a day — thanks to this — ah — gentleman.”\n\nDean turned and saw an individual in not the best of clothes, gazing down at the body of the redhead. Shaking his head mournfully, he slouched over to the couple sitting on the floor. Dean recognized the black-eyed bum.\n\n“Thanks, lady, for the kind word” — he said with the hint of a grin. “All right now, young feller? Yeah — me and the cops breezed in through that lumber,” indicating the smashed boarding over the windows. “I trailed you here; didn’t like the looks o’ you with that greasy, grinnin’ hog. When you disappeared in this black old dump, I didn’t know what to do — just wandered around. But my hunch that somethin’ was rotten kept botherin’ me, so I beat it for the station and gave ‘em an earful.”\n\n“You saved both of us,” murmured Dean, rising, and extending a cordial hand to the bum. “A few minutes later — “\n\n“I’m all right. I wanted to see if I was right about poor old ‘Red.’”\n\nHe looked sorrowfully toward the sheeted figure.\n\n“Well — must be runnin’ along. Glad we pinched that laughin’ monster. So long!”\n\nHe turned at the doorway, his black eyes alight.\n\n“Take it from me, young feller, whenever that young lady talks, you listen!”\n\nThey threw him a laughing farewell.\n\n“Good advice,” murmured Dean. “Come on now — out with it all!”\n\n“That’s easy,” replied Hester, happily. “I’ve been aching to tell you for months, but didn’t dare. First of all, Jim dear, you must know that I used to be a trained nurse, but for the last two years have been a detective. This Doctor Rudah, who was once a well-known surgeon and psychologist, had been suspected for some time of causing the disappearance of several poor chaps, hangers-on of the park. Because of my medical knowledge, I was put on the case, and managed to get a job as his assistant. I soon found out what was wrong.”\n\n“Why, he’s crazy, isn’t he?” interrupted Dean. “Plain nutty!”\n\n“Yes — nutty, but not plain! He was insane without a doubt, but so shrewd and apparently normal that I could never catch him with any damning proof. He told me that all these bodies he operated on were unidentified suicides and that sort. Perhaps you saw the hole in that poor fellow’s head over there.”\n\n“That’s what I was looking at when he choked me.”\n\n“Well, his particular style of mania connected itself with blue eyes. That’s why I was so afraid for you. Did you ever bear the theory that blue eyes indicate intellectuality, as opposed to dark eyes, which signify emotional temperament?”\n\n“Sure — something like that.”\n\n“There’s some truth in it. Well, when Rudah went mad, he was a brain specialist. In his craze he believed that blue eyes meant a greater weight of brain and complexity of gray matter — both of which are held to indicate great brain power. The bluer the eye, the greater the weight of brain — and of fascination for him. That’s why he was so pleased with you. And because he wanted the head to examine, he always shot his victims through the heart!”\n\n“I see.” Dean grinned. “That’s the reason you hollered at me not to move. I thought you were batty. Still, I don’t see why I wasn’t — “\n\n“This is the reason.” Hester picked up a thick flatiron without a handle, from a table. “Knowing his methods, when I found you bound here in the darkness, I stuffed this in your shirt pocket over your heart. I knew he was a crack shot, and anyway, Jim, I had to do something quick, and that was the best I could think of.”\n\n“It did the business, sweetheart.” His arm slid around her. “But even now I am ignorant as to the most important bit of the mystery. What is your honest, un-detective name — the name I can kiss you by?”\n\n“Why, Jim, you knew that long ago.” Brown eyes fled from blue, and a head of dark hair snuggled into his shoulder. “It’s Hester — Hester Dean!”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Fashion Plate\n  Two Little White Blobs\n  The Dead Fingers Clinging\n  Mr. Rawlings — Guess He’s Dead\n  White Linen Trousers\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nFashion Plate\n\nThey called him Fashion Plate. George Bryan didn’t mind it. They were just ignorant village louts, loafers around the pool hall, stationery store and the little railroad station of Shady Valley; they thought, because Bryan took pride in being always carefully dressed, that he was something to jibe at. Beau Brummel. Young George Bryan secretly was pleased at being likened to the famous English dandy. Beau Brummel’s name, also, had been George Bryan.\n\nThe thoughts were roaming in Bryan’s mind tonight, as alone in his car he drove from New York City, out the main highway toward Shady Valley. His nickname of Fashion Plate — surely that would be an advantage this momentous night. Who would ever suspect the immaculate, soft-spoken George Bryan of a deed of violence? He chuckled to himself. The villagers might think of him as a sissy, but never as a murderer …\n\nAt the crossroads where the highway went on into the village, Bryan turned off onto the Lake Ontara side road. He watched his chance, so that nu one saw him. The time was quarter of ten — a hot July evening. Queer what a breathless night it was! He was conscious that his heart was pounding; his chest seemed to have a weight or, it. Was he frightened, now that his chance had come? Nonsense! Just excited. Fate was with him. Every circumstance was just right. Peter Rawlings would be coming along this lonely road by the edge of the lake, in five or ten minutes now. The thing would be done, in a few minutes after that.\n\nThe idea of killing Peter Rawlings had come to Bryan from Rawlings himself. Rawlings had said:\n\n“You know, George, I’m determined to teach myself how to swim this summer, if it kills me.”\n\nJust a little thing like that. But Grace — Bryan’s sister, who was Raw- lings’ wife — had heard it; and so had others. It was Bryan’s chance. Nothing could seem more obviously accidental than the drowning of a man who had declared he was going to teach himself how to swim, even if it killed him!\n\nAnd now had come the first breathless, hot night of the summer — just the sort of night that would tempt one to take a dip in the lake. Bryan could see the lake now between the trees that lined the rocky little side road. The water was a big, lead- grey mirror, dark and sullen under the glowering clouds. There might be people and small boats over by the distant opposite shore, far behind the big wooded island, but there was no one here.\n\nAt a place where bushes clustered to shroud his car, Bryan turned off the road and hopped out. He was a young fellow, handsome, and as always, immaculately dressed. In the heat, he had taken off his hat and blue serge jacket and laid them on the car seat. His figure was a white blob of white shirt and carefully pressed white linen trousers, as he crouched in- the bushes, waiting for Rawlings to come along. It surely wouldn’t be long now. Rawlings was a methodical fellow, a creature of habit. You could always depend on him doing the same thing at the same time. He had married Bryan’s younger sister, Grace about two years ago. He was rich, or at least comfortably well off — one of those fellows who watched every penny and wouldn’t lend a cent to a relative without bankers’ security. He owned a small but prosperous department store in Thomasville, some twelve miles away. He closed it at nine-thirty; and every night like clockwork he drove home alone, leaving Thomasville at quarter of ten and coming along this lonely little side road past Lake Ontara.\n\nFor another ten minutes Bryan silently crouched. He was tense, alert; his mind was clicking with details of just what he would do so that there would be no possibility of error. There would be no footprints here; no tracks which could be identified as the tread of his tires. The road was hard and dry; the ground all around here was rocky, right down to the rocky shore where the water lapped with a sullen murmur in the stillness.\n\nAnd suddenly now, faintly in the distance he heard the chug of Rawlings’ old, outmoded car. Right on schedule. Bryan’s heart leaped, but he steadied himself. He stood in the shadow of a tree-trunk until he could see positively that it was Rawlings, and then he jumped forward. Rawlings, in white shirt and trousers, was a dim white blob behind the wheel. For just a second Bryan thought that there was someone in the back seat of the car behind him, but when he got closer he saw that no one else was there.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nTwo Little White Blobs\n\n“Well, I say, that you, Peter?” he called.\n\nRawlings saw him and pulled up.\n\n“Hello, George,” he said. He was never very cordial. “What are you doing out here?”\n\nBryan mastered his breathlessness. “Just coming back from New York. Wretchedly hot, isn’t it? I thought I’d take a swim. Cool off.” He gestured easily with a graceful hand. “My car’s down the road a way — thought I’d take a ten-minute dip. Too bad you can’t join me, old fellow — you’ve no idea how invigorating — “\n\nQueer how difficult it was to keep his soft, suave voice normal! This damnable breathlessness! But Rawlings didn’t notice. And it wasn’t hard to persuade him.\n\n“The human body really floats in water, you know,” Bryan was presently saying. “It’s lighter than water, when you immerse nearly all of it. But that’s the trouble — the beginner wants to climb out of the water and that’s what makes him sink.” Gruesome words. Somehow they made Bryan shudder inside. He had had no idea it would be so difficult to do this thing.\n\n“Why not master your fear once and for all?” he added persuasively. “Once you do that, I can teach you to swim in two minutes.”\n\nAbruptly Rawlings set his jaw. “All right,” he agreed. “I’ll do it.”\n\nPerfect! Nothing could go wrong now. There was no one to see them as they went down the dark declivity, just two little white blobs down on the sullen shorefront where in a moment tumbled clusters of rocks and the rise of ground hid them wholly from the road. Hastily they undressed. “I’ve only got one towel,” Bryan was saying smoothly. “But it’s a big one; we can both use it.”\n\nHe had brought the big bath towel from New York. But Rawlings wouldn’t be the one to use it; he’d be lying floating in the shallow water … There mustn’t be any outcry now. Just a little splashing and gurgling. Rawlings was a man about Bryan’s height and build, but older, not so muscular. It wouldn’t be hard to hold him under — just for a minute and then he’d inevitably gulp in water and start to strangle. There mustn’t be any marks on him; nothing that would show violence …\n\n“I guess — I guess this is deep enough,” Rawlings quavered as his instinctive, abnormal fear of the water made him tremble.\n\n“Just a little further,” Bryan urged. “I say, old man, don’t be such a coward.”\n\nIt was pathetic to see Rawlings trying to conquer what he knew was an idiotic terror. That was queer, too; Rawlings with that terror all his life, as though something within him, deep beneath his conscious brain, had always known that he was destined to meet his death like this.\n\n“I’ll do it if it kills me,” Rawlings was muttering. “Damn it, I will.”\n\nGruesome prophesy … why did he have to say that so much? As though something were making him say it so that Bryan would shudder, with a racing heart and excited, taut nerves to make him fumble this thing? But he wouldn’t fumble it … Get him to lie on his back now; and then shove him down, sit on him … Hold him, just for a moment.\n\nBryan’s chest seemed bursting with the excitement of it. But he kept his wits. Water a bit less than waist deep. That would be ideal.\n\n“Now, relax,” he heard himself saying softly. “You’re tense as the devil, Peter. Don’t be like that. I won’t even let your face get wet. I promise. Come on now, lie back — stretch out. I’ll put my hand under your neck. Can’t you trust me, old fellow? Think how pleased Grace will be if she can go swimming with you next week.”\n\nSo easy. A faint smile of triumph twitched at Bryan’s lips as he stood beside the shivering, naked Rawlings and the taut body of the older man eased backward with his feet coming up.\n\n“Don’t let my head go under, George!”\n\n“No. Of course I won’t.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Dead Fingers Clinging\n\nNow, down with him! Bryan shoved suddenly. There was only a little floundering splash; air bubbles rising, with the water down there choking Rawlings’ first startled scream. And then it was a grim, silent struggle under water, with all the weight of Bryan’s body pressing his victim’s head and shoulders against the bottom. Less than three feet of water; most of the weight of Bryan’s body was out of it as he sprawled, with his knees and hands down. Rawlings was like a great, floundering trapped fish. Weirdly, unexpectedly strong at first as Bryan desperately clung to him. His legs were up now, churning the water, beating it white. God, why wouldn’t he die?\n\nIt was a chaos of horror to the panting Bryan. But he kept Rawlings’ head under … A minute. Two minutes. There were no air bubbles now. The air had all come out; water was going in. From his first gasping, under-water scream the inexperienced Rawlings had been strangling. But his struggle was ghastly. Like fighting with a great white thing that ought to be dead, but still lunging. More feebly now. Got him!\n\nHold him! Never mind his threshing legs; keep his head and shoulders down! Three minutes. Four perhaps. It seemed an eternity to Bryan’s whirling senses while he sprawled there and clung. Like fighting with a dead man. Limp, gruesome white thing that still waved its arms and legs and feebly, aimlessly twitched.\n\nAnd then even the twitching was stilled. The dead fingers clinging to Bryan’s arms relaxed, slipped away, the legs floated up, weaving a little from the movement of the water, as though the ghastly limp white thing were still alive.\n\nFor another moment the cold, shaking Bryan clung; and then he staggered to his feet. And the dead thing floated up beside him, with water lapping over its goggling face.\n\nHorrible. He had no idea it would be like that. He stood ankle deep in the water, shivering, numbed, with a sudden panic sweeping him. What a chance he had taken! Suppose someone had come along and seen him? Could you see down here from any part of the nearby road? Suppose someone came along now?\n\nThe wild panic swept Bryan as he Stood shivering there in the dark; a panic of haste and terror. But he fought with it; conquered it. The thing was done, and triumph swept him. He dried himself carefully with the towel and dressed. His hair wasn’t wet; that was lucky. It wasn’t even mussed. There wasn’t a mark on him from the struggle with the drowning Rawlings whose gripping hands had only clutched so futilely at his arms.\n\nBut this panic was horrible. Despite the heat of the night, Bryan’s teeth were chattering, but as he dried and dressed he felt warmer. It was the cold water, but mostly it was the excitement. He mustn’t get rattled now and forget the towel. The towel with which he had dried himself was a little white blob at his feet. He snatched it up; ran for the road and his car … Yes, from farther along here you could faintly see that weird white thing, half-immersed there in the shallow water of the shore. Somebody would pass here and see it, tonight perhaps, or certainly in the morning.\n\nWith the panic still on him, mingling with his chuckling triumph, Bryan climbed back into his dark little car and swiftly drove away. He did not head for Shady Valley; he was too clever for that. Instead, driving as swiftly as he dared, he circled back around Thomasville, then cut across and hit the New York Highway at a point far below Shady Valley and the Lake Ontara side road. He passed two gas stands where he was known; drove slowly enough so that the attendants would see him and respond to his wave of greeting. Exactly as though he were on his way home from the city; no possible connection with Lake Ontara …\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nMr. Rawlings — Guess He’s Dead\n\nHe had stopped at the bridge over Sunapee Creek, tied a big stone in the towel and sunk it. The panic was gone now; there was nothing but triumph. Nothing ahead of him now but Rawlings’ money. Grace, a shocked, grieved young widow, wouldn’t be niggardly with her sympathetic brother, of course. She had already done her best, pawning her jewels to help Bryan out with his gambling debts. Bryan was senior teller at the little Shady Valley bank. Grace didn’t know about his six thou- sand-dollar shortage there, of course. That would have been discovered next week, when the bank examiners arrived; but it would be made good by Grace now, of course. He shivered at the closeness of his escape.\n\nIt was nearly eleven o’clock when presently he was entering the somnolent little tree-lined street of Shady Valley. He had adjusted his collar and tie in the little rear-view mirror. His hair was sleek and in perfect array, as always. Everything was perfect. Nothing ahead of him now but gentle sympathy with Grace; and then the spending of Grace’s money on Vivian. The thought of Vivian, her dark eyes, her beauty, thrilled him. Vivian was worth spending money on.\n\nAs he reached Center Avenue, Bryan’s heart jumped. Down the broad shaded street, where the cluster of lamps over a stoop marked the brick building, which was the Shady Valley Police Station, a little commotion was evident. A group of people was on the sidewalk; a big sedan was there at the curb; and inside the building there was evidently unusual activity.\n\nBryan hopped out and joined the crowd. “I say, what’s happened?” he demanded of a pimply-faced youth.\n\n“Oh, you, Fashion Plate.” But the village boy wasn’t jibing. He was awed; excited. “Your brother-in- law,” he said. “Mr. Rawlings — guess he’s dead — he was found down in the lake near the Thomasville cut-off.”\n\nThen the milling little crowd saw Bryan. Everyone always stared at him, stared with a secret envy, Bryan thought. They stared at him now as he stood, immaculate in white linen trousers, with a carnation in the lapel of his blue serge jacket. And they crowded around him; gave him swift, incoherent details … a night-driving tourist, through Thomasville, heading for Albany, had seen the white thing in the lake, momentarily disclosed by his headlights as he rounded a bend in the road. He’d brought it in a rush here to the police station. The&amp;gt; policemen inside now were trying artificial respiration.\n\nThat made Bryan’s heart leap into his throat. Suppose they succeeded … Surely that wasn’t possible now …\n\n“Not a damn pulmotor in this burg,” somebody was saying. “There’s one coming from Thomasville, but what the hell — “\n\n“Why — why, good heavens, that’s terrible — my brother-in-law, you say?” He knew that he should force his way into the police station. That was the normal thing to do — a shocked relative … He’d phone poor Grace from inside …\n\nThe tourist appeared on the stoop. “Not a chance,” he said to the crowd. “He’s a goner.”\n\nA vast relief flooded Bryan as he shoved his way to the steps. But why was everybody looking at him so strangely? All these young loafers in the crowd who knew him so well, all staring at him, murmuring to each other.\n\n“Lookit Fashion Plate!”\n\n“Oh my goodness, how disgraceful!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nWhite Linen Trousers\n\nWhat the devil! Bryan’s heart was racing. The accursed village louts were jibing at him. But they seemed puzzled, too, standing away from him, staring at him. He realized that he was in the light of the police station now.\n\n“My Gawd,” somebody gasped, “Why does he look so frightened?” Fashion Plate! Accursed nickname. Accursed reputation. Without them, no one would have noticed him …\n\n“Why — why — “ he was stammering. “I say, don’t push me like this. What’s the matter with you fellows?”\n\nHe was in the police station now, with two or three uniformed men clustering around him. It was all a blur to his terrified sight. A ring of staring eyes; voices … “Lookit him! Fashion Plate never looked like this before.”\n\n“Why is he so frightened?”\n\n“Damn queer — something queer about this, fellers — “\n\nHands were plucking at him. What in heaven’s name could this mean? Then suddenly he realized that the policemen were searching him; taking things from his pockets. His familiar things from his jacket pocket …\n\nThen abruptly one of the big policemen’ was saying:\n\n“You, Bryan — when did you last see your brother-in-law?”\n\n“Me? See Peter? Why — why, I haven’t seen him for a week.”\n\nWhat was this? What was the matter with everybody here? These things they were taking from Bryan’s pockets —\n\n“Didn’t see him tonight — not at all today?” the policeman persisted.\n\n“No. No, of course, I didn’t.” “Didn’t happen to go swimming with him tonight by any chance, did you?”\n\nWhat in the devil? The scene was swaying before Bryan’s terrified gaze. He fought for calmness, mustered his courage to grin.\n\n“Say, what’s the matter with all you people? Is this some kind of joke? Of course, I didn’t go swimming. Haven’t seen Peter in a week, I told you.”\n\n“But you’re a good swimmer?” “Yes. Sure I am. What in hell has that — “\n\n“You wouldn’t let your brother-in-law drown waist deep in water, would you now?” the police sergeant said ironically. “Funny thing, Bryan — the lake there where he drowned — only waist deep. Not over your head anywhere near there — and no current, no tide in the lake to wash the body from somewhere else. Especially since he was found when he had been dead only a few minutes. It was murder, Bryan — “\n\n“Murder?” Bryan stammered. “Why — why, how awful — “\n\n“Yes, isn’t it? And if you didn’t go swimming with Rawlings — “\n\nThe big sergeant gestured with grim irony to the things he was taking from Bryan’s trousers’ pockets … A memorandum dated today, on a billhead of Rawlings’ store … A telegram to Rawlings …\n\n“He got that telegram at nine o’clock tonight,” the sergeant said. “Stuffed it here into his trousers’ pocket — “\n\nSickened with horror, Bryan stared down at his white linen trousers, and his whirling mind swept back … that dark cluster of rocks on the- shorefront where he and Rawlings had undressed … Their clothes had been in separate piles. Except the white trousers. He realized it now — the white trousers, both so similar, laying partly on top of each other, with the white towel on them — just dim pallid blobs down there in the darkness of the ground. And as he dressed after the murder Bryan had been in such a panic of haste and excitement he had had no time to think o himself at all, nor in his dark car until he had come here … The first time in his life that Beau Brummel had neglected his appearance!\n\n“We’ve got you, Bryan — “\n\n“Yes, you — you’ve got me — “\n\nHe hardly realized he was saying it. He was still blankly staring down at his white linen trousers. But they were Rawlings’ white linen trousers rumpled and dirty, very far from being neatly pressed because Rawlings was no Fashion Plate!\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

Old Mac, the gateman, peered at her car, then swung open the gates smartly.\n\n“Well, well. Missy!” he said. “How’s my girl?”\n\n“Fine, Mac,” Marcia Bramson said. As one of her father’s oldest employees this man had been a special confidant in her youth. But now, with her father dead and herself a woman grown, she did not feel the closeness of years ago.\n\n“How’s little Miss?”\n\n“Splendid,” she said “Away at school.”\n\nMarcia looked toward the building which housed the Turner Shipyard offices.\n\n“Is Paul — is Mr. Bramson still here?”\n\nMac nodded.\n\n“Saw your husband heading out to the Navy contracts, hour or so ago. Some keel-laying there this morning.” The old man nodded at the car. “New one, eh? Foreign?”\n\n“Yes,” she said, “it’s a surprise for — “\n\nQuickly she caught herself. There was no point in going into details about the car with Mac.\n\nShe parked and got out and walked toward the office building, annoyed at the look in old Mac’s eyes — the knowing, pitying look — which said that he knew all about Marcia and Paul Bramson.\n\nThe way everyone knew, she realized. Once upon a time there was a girl named Marcia Turner whose very wealthy father bought her a nice, handsome Navy officer for a husband. Now, with father dead, the very wealthy girl was trying to buy the nice, handsome husband’s affection still. He strays, you see. Not too openly, but …\n\nSo the very wealthy Mrs. Bramson gives him the presidency of the Turner Shipyards. Or a big new house up in the Heights. Or a fine, blooded saddle horse.\n\nAnd now a brand-new, imported convertible.\n\nAt least she had an excuse this time. Their eighth anniversary. Eight years since that afternoon when her father had given her hand over to the slim young Naval officer, and Marcia Turner had thought herself the luckiest girl alive — war or no war. She’d been nineteen, shy and plain and immature, but deliriously happy in an unhappy world.\n\nShe had yet to learn of young love growing brittle when it finds no answering love, no true and honest sharing. When it struggles against fawning greed … . But she had tried, giving what she could — first her love; and when that was not enough, a child. But that, too, had not proved the binding agent. And thus, because she had nothing else, her money …\n\nThe door at the end of the corridor was lettered chastely, in gold, Paul Bramson, President. Inside, Dorene Chandler, Paul’s secretary — a beautiful pale blonde — sat with the air of a golden queen behind her desk.\n\n“Yes?” she inquired languidly as Marcia entered. “Oh, Mrs. Bramson! How are you?”\n\n“Fine,” Marcia lied again. “Is Mr. Bramson inside?”\n\nThe girl nodded.\n\n“I’ll tell him you’re here.”\n\n“Never mind.”\n\nMarcia let herself into her husband’s sumptuously appointed office, and he looked up from his desk when the door swung inward.\n\n“Well — well, Marcia! A bit off your course, aren’t you?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nDeath Threat\n\nHe was a tall, dark man, superbly tailored, matching the fine appointments of his office. His face held a look of deep concern — but certainly nothing of the dark rage which he had worn two nights ago, after their last blowup, when she had mentioned divorce and he had gone storming off to his club. The club to which she had bought his membership.\n\nHe swept a pile of morning newspapers off his desk into the leather-tooled wastebasket.\n\n“And to what am I indebted for this — visit? Just checking up on me?”\n\n“Please, Paul!”\n\nAll of her pleading for their tottering marriage was in her voice; all of the love for him which she could not cut out of herself.\n\n“I didn’t mean to disturb you. I just thought — well, our anniversary and all.”\n\nShe pointed at the banks of windows which commanded the yards.\n\n“Remember that English convertible we saw, Paul?”\n\nHe looked at her sharply, the storm points clearing from his eyes.\n\n“Marcia!” he said; brightly, like the spoiled, petulant child she knew so well. “Why, darling! Don’t tell me — “\n\nThey stood at the windows and looked down at the automobile for long, quiet moments. Then they went out together, hand in hand, past the surprised Miss Chandler. For the next hour or so, speeding through the Spring-touched countryside, they were almost as they had been so long ago, companions in a beginning dream that knew no threat of wakefulness.\n\nIn the flush of her excitement, Marcia suggested that they drive up to The Oaks — the small hideaway estate which her late father had given them for a honeymoon present. And abruptly Paul sobered, his lips going thin in his face.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n“Something — er — something’s come up, Marcy. I — I don’t want anyone to think I’m running away, right now.”\n\nOn the drive back home he told her about the letters threatening his life.\n\nBack at the house, he produced a letter, and Marcia read it with a growing dread.\n\nThe note was brief and to the point:\n\nYou are going to die, Bramson. Don’t think you can escape.\n\nThe words had been cut from newspapers and were pasted on a sheet of plain white paper.\n\nPaul stood frowning in front of the fireplace, a drink tinkling in his hand.\n\n“I got the first one a week ago,” he told her. “I thought some crank was pulling a gag. Then, day before yesterday, this one came to the office.”\n\nBeyond her fear, Marcia felt the first faint stirring of hope. If this had been on Paul’s mind the last few days, it accounted for his moodiness, his irritability. It wasn’t just herself he found displeasing!\n\n“You’ve called the police, haven’t you, Paul?”\n\n“Now, don’t you go worrying.”\n\nHe crumpled the sheet of paper and tossed it into the roaring fireplace. “I can handle this without publicity — without a houseful of big-footed cops. I don’t have that gun collection just to look at!”\n\nOver her protests, he took one of his small automatics with him when he went out to the new car. He said he’d be very careful, of course, on the drive to pick up his things at the club. Despite the nagging worry, Marcia Bramson felt better than she had in days when her husband kissed her good-by.\n\nPaul was back in less than an hour. Marcia heard the front door open, the murmured conversation with the maid, then he came into the sitting room where she waited. All of the eagerness drained out of her when she saw his face.\n\n“Paul — what’s wrong?” She was at his side instantly.\n\n“They — they weren’t fooling,” he said hoarsely. His fingers trembled as he lit a cigarette. “They weren’t kidding at all.”\n\nHe took a deep drag of smoke.\n\n“Somebody shot at me, Marcy, just before I turned into our drive.” He laughed nervously. “A miss, thank God. But they put a pretty convincing hole through the windshield.”\n\nIn her quiet voice she said, “I’m going to phone the police.”\n\nThe expected defiance did not come.\n\n“Yes,” he said, “I guess you’d better.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Attempt\n\nPlainclothes Sergeant Fernold was a younger man than Marcia had expected, but he looked hard and competent. He asked his questions economically, nodding as they confirmed a point, or raising his thick eyebrows in a demand for further clarity.\n\n“You destroyed both letters?” he said, tapping his pencil against his notebook. “Too bad. But whoever wrote it was probably careful about prints, anyway. We’ll check the car and see what Ballistics can come up with.”\n\nHe put the notebook and pencil in his pocket.\n\n“I won’t pretend we got much to go on. No known enemies — no leads to follow. So we play it close and careful. Check the servants, people at the ship-yards, tradesmen — everybody. I’ll stay here — go back and forth to the office with you.”\n\nThey finished the drinks Marcia had fixed, and Fernold suggested Paul show him around. Paul and the sergeant went outside, checking doors and windows on the ground floor, while Marcia and the butler toured inside, locking up.\n\nWhen she joined the men downstairs, Paul was answering questions about the main gate. Fernold decided it wouldn’t hurt to take a look, and the three of them walked through the chill Spring twilight down to the road, where the sergeant examined the tall stone wall that bordered the estate.\n\n“Nobody’s cracking that,” he said, “without a ladder, or maybe a highvanned truck. We’ll put a guard on the grounds.”\n\nThere was some traffic on the road that ran past the gate, and none of them was paying much attention to it. Suddenly, Marcia felt Paul grab her roughly by the arm and shove her toward the stone wall.\n\n“Look out!” Paul screamed. “Look out!”\n\nShe caught a glimpse of the car, then — a big, black sedan bearing down on them. It all happened in a flash — the car swinging in off the road, hunting them, the motor roaring like an angry beast. The hood of the sedan growled to within a few feet of them before its driver had to twist away to avoid hitting the wall, then the car was spitting mud and dirt back into their faces as it roared away down the road, rocking, building speed.\n\nShe heard shots — Fernold pumping his pistol after the car; then the sedan vanished around a bend in the road.\n\n“You okay, you okay?” Fernold was asking.\n\nShaken, mud-stained and trembling, Paul said, “Close! That was too damn close!”\n\n“Mrs. Bramson?”\n\n“I’m — all right,” Marcia managed.\n\nIn the house, Paul made a round of stiff drinks while Fernold called Headquarters. There wasn’t much any of them could give them about the murder car beyond a pretty general description.\n\nThroughout dinner Paul ate very little — and drank more than was usual, even for him. His nervousness was in plain sight for Marcia and Fernold to see.\n\n“Dammit!” Paul exploded finally. “If only we had some idea who it could be — what’s behind it all — something we could work against!”\n\nFernold nodded. “We’re in the dark, all right. But that doesn’t mean you’re going to be a sitting duck. You can count on us for protection twenty-four hours a day.”\n\n“Sure, sure,” Paul sneered. “Like before, out on the road! I’ll bet the Police Department will even guarantee a motorcycle escort for the funeral!”\n\nHe finished his drink in one gulp.\n\n“Maybe it would be best if my wife and I did clear out for a while, Sergeant.”\n\nOf course, she thought. Just get in the new car and drive — anywhere. Put distance between themselves and this unknown terror that was stalking them … .\n\n“We’ll leave tonight,” she said. “I can throw our things in a bag. We’ll slip away in the dark.”\n\nFernold growled. “You’re safer here — believe me. Sit tight and everything will be okay. You get outside and you’re a real target.”\n\nPaul slammed down his empty glass.\n\n“Dammit, at least I’ll feel I’m doing something — not just sitting waiting for some nut to kill me!”\n\nHis lips thinned as he looked at Marcia.\n\n“I — I can do this alone, Marcy. I mean, you don’t — “\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“If you go, I go.”\n\n“Let me send a man with you,” Fernold suggested. “At least — “\n\n“You keep working this end.”\n\nPaul smiled grimly.\n\n“If you fellows don’t know where we are, stands to reason no one else will know, Sergeant.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nEnd of the Ride\n\nThey went north on the back roads until they were well clear of town, then Paul took the long convertible over to the main highway and sped them through the night. They drove in silence for over an hour, with Marcia twisted around in the seat, peering anxiously behind, reading danger into each new set of headlights her eyes picked up. She wanted to be somewhere far away, safe and secure in Paul’s arms, finished with this dreadful night … .\n\nShe heard Paul say, “So far, so good. I think I may be in the clear, Marcy.”\n\nHe stretched at the wheel, easing the tension in his shoulders.\n\n“Light me a cigarette, will you?”\n\nShe got one from her purse and fumbled for the matches. Her hand touched the cool, reassuring bulk of the gun that she had taken, unknown to Paul, from his collection. In their last-minute packing, it had seemed a good idea — a positive action on her part. It was foolishly feminine, probably, but the gun gave her a feeling of satisfaction, of courage, almost. If there were trouble, she could be of some help to Paul.\n\n“Well?” he asked crossly.\n\n“I’m sorry,” she said, handing over the cigarette.\n\nShe could tell from the way he shoved it to his mouth that he was still shaken. He took long, lung-filling puffs of the cigarette, and the faint red glow gave his face an almost Satanic cast. She found her heart pounding uncontrollably again.\n\nAnd when he pulled the convertible into the side of the road and jammed on the brakes, naked fear clutched her at the throat.\n\n“What is it? Why are we stopping, Paul?”\n\nWithout speaking, he got out of the car and came around to her side. In his hand she saw a gun, in his eyes a terrible hatred.\n\n“Paul! Paul, what is it?”\n\nBut she did not have to ask the question, nor hear his answer to understand.\n\n“End of the ride, Marcy. The finish of this little game I’ve been playing … .”\n\nLike a suddenly remembered nightmare, she saw the complete shape of this day out of their lives — this day of anguish and uncertainty and pain. The letter … Paul’s claiming he’d been shot at … the automobile that didn’t kill him …\n\n“Yes, Marcy,” he said. “Me. Your husband. Your widower. It was clever, don’t you think? Sending myself those threatening letters, shooting a hole in the windshield. Having that fool Fernold right there when the car attacked us.”\n\n“You’re mad, Paul!”\n\n“No, darling.”\n\nShe was conscious of the irony of the term; he had not called her darling in weeks.\n\n“Just fed up, with you, with us. But I had to devise a — separation that would permit me to retain your fortune. Now when I report your death to the police, and tell them how I battled against these unknown fiends who have been threatening to kill me, and how they killed you before I drove them off — “ he laughed — “even Fernold won’t suspect, darling!”\n\n“Paul — you can’t — “\n\n“But I can, darling.” He brought up the gun.\n\nShe could not tell from what depth of her fear she summoned the will, the strength, to throw herself to the side and grab the gun in her purse. She could not remember the sequence of her movements, or of Paul’s, in that wild, blast-shattered sequence that was both instantaneous and eternal at once — a time of terror and surprise and unconscious reaction … .\n\nAnd death … .\n\n***\n\nShe could tell Sergeant Fernold only that part of it which she could understand herself, when she fully realized that Fernold was real and there beside her.\n\n“You were never too far out in front of me,” he explained. “But I couldn’t catch up to you — in time.”\n\n“I didn’t want to kill him,” she said. “I didn’t mean to. But he was mad. It’s all mad!”\n\nIn his police car, the sergeant carefully started the words for her, asking without demand, helping her get it out into the open. She told him what she knew, what Paul had told her, about this horrible pattern of murder which Paul had so carefully created.\n\n“I got one lead on the radio from Headquarters,” Fernold said. “The car that tried to run us down this evening is pretty much like one Dorene Chandler — that secretary of his — has been driving lately.”\n\nMarcia put her face in her hands.\n\nFiercely, she said, “It’s not just for myself, Sergeant. My daughter, Missy — All this. … “\n\nShe began to cry, the sobs wracking her.\n\n“Missy,” she moaned.\n\nFernold put in a call for the Medical Examiner’s crew, and someone to drive back the convertible. He gave Marcia a cigarette and lit one for himself.\n\nAfter a moment he said:\n\n“Look, this thing can work more than one way, you know. It doesn’t have to go any further than you and me. Officially, well, the Department can pretend it’s still looking for these ‘unknown killers’ that were after your husband. The ones who got him,” he added carefully. “You don’t have to figure in it all.”\n\nHe put the car in gear and turned it toward the city.\n\n“Leave it to me,” he said simply.\n\nMarcia raised her eyes and faced the road ahead.\n\n“Yes,” she said. “Oh, yes.”\n\nShe did not look back.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

      "content_html": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeated in a large armchair near the fire, his elbows on his knees, his hands held out to the warmth, he was talking slowly, interrupting himself abruptly now and again with a murmured: “Yes … yes …” as if he were trying to gather up, to make sure of his memories; then he would continue his sentence.\n\nThe table beside him was littered with papers, books, odds and ends of various kinds. The lamp was turned low; I could see nothing of him except his pallid face and his hands, long and thin in the firelight.\n\nThe purring of a cat that lay on the hearthrug and the crackling of the logs that sent up strangely shaped flames were the only sounds that broke the silence. He was speaking in a faraway voice as a man might in his sleep:\n\n“Yes … yes … It was the great, the greatest misfortune of my life. I could have borne the loss of every penny I possess, of my health … anything … everything … but not that! To have lived for ten years with the woman you adore, and then to watch her die and be left to face life alone … quite alone … it was almost more than I could bear … . It is six months since I lost her … . How long ago it seems! And how short the days used to be! … If only she had been ill for some time, if only there had been some warning! … It seems a horrible thing to say, but when you know beforehand, the mind gets prepared, doesn’t it? … Little by little the heart readjusts its outlook … you grow used to the idea … . But as it was …”\n\n“But I thought she had been ill for some time?” I said.\n\nHe shook his head:\n\n“Not at all, not at all. … It was quite sudden … . The doctors were never even able to find out what was the matter with her. … It all happened and was over in two days. Since then I don’t know how or why I have gone on living. All day long I wander ‘round the house looking for some reminder of her that I never find, imagining that she will appear to me from behind the hangings, that a breath of her scent will come to me in the empty rooms. …”\n\nHe stretched out his hand towards the table:\n\n“Look! Yesterday I found that … this veil, in one of my pockets. She gave it to me to carry one evening when we were at the theatre, and I try to believe it still smells of her perfume, is still warm from its contact with her face … . But no … . Nothing remains … except sorrow … though there is something, only it … it … In the first shock of grief, you sometimes have extraordinary ideas.\n\n… Can you believe that I photographed her lying on her deathbed? I took my camera into the white, silent room, and lit the magnesium wire: yes, overwhelmed as I was with grief, I did with the most scrupulous precaution and care things from which I should shrink today, revolting things … . Yet it is a great consolation to know she is there, that I shall be able to see her again as she looked that last day.”\n\n“Where is this photograph ?” I asked.\n\nLeaning forward, he replied in a low voice:\n\n“I haven’t got it, or rather I have it. … I have the plate, but I have never developed it … . It is still in the camera. … I have never had the courage to touch it … . Yet how I have longed for it!”\n\nHe laid his hand on my arm: “Listen … tonight … your visit … the way I have been able to talk about her … it makes me feel better, almost strong again … . Would you, will you come with me to the darkroom? Will you help me to develop the plate?”\n\nHe looked into my face with the anxious, questioning expression of a child who fears he may be refused something he longs to have.\n\n“Of course I will,” I answered.\n\nHe rose quickly.\n\n“Yes … with you it will be different. With you I shall feel calm … and it will do me good. … I shall be much happier … you’ll see …”\n\nWe went to the dark-room, a closet with bottles ranged round on shelves. A trestle-table, littered with dishes, glasses and books, ran along one side of the wall.\n\nBy the light of a candle that threw flickering shadows round him, he examined in silence the labels on the bottles and rubbed some dishes.\n\nPresently he lit a lamp with red glass, blew out the candle, and said to me: “Shut the door.”\n\nThere was something dramatic about the darkness relieved only by the blood-red light. Unexpected reflections touched the sides of the bottles, played on his wrinkled cheeks, on his hollow temples. He said:\n\n“Is the door closely shut? Then I will begin.”\n\nHe opened a dark slide and took out the plate. Holding it carefully at the comers between his thumb and first fingers, he looked at it intently for a long time as if trying to see the invisible picture which was so soon to appear.\n\n“She is there,” he murmured. “How wonderful!”\n\nWith great care he let it glide into the bath and began to rock the dish.\n\nI cannot say why, but it seemed to me that the tapping of the porcelain on the boards at regular intervals made a curiously mournful sound: the monotonous lapping of the liquid suggested a vague sobbing, and I could not lift my eyes from the milk-colored piece of glass which was slowly taking on a darker line round its edges.\n\nI looked at my friend. His lips were trembling as he murmured words and sentences which I failed to catch.\n\nHe drew out the plate, held it up to the level of his eyes, and, as I leant over his shoulders, explained:\n\n“Its coming up … slowly … My developer is rather weak … But that’s nothing … Look, the high lights are coming … Wait … you’ll see ; . .”\n\nHe put the plate back, and it sank into the developer with a soft, sucking sound.\n\nThe gray color had spread uniformly over the whole plate. He explained, his head lowered:\n\n“That dark rectangle is the bed . . , up above, that square”— he pointed it out with a motion of his chin—“is the pillow; and in the middle, that lighter part with the pale streak outlined on the background … that is … Look, there is the crucifix I put between her fingers. My poor little one … my darling …”\n\nHis voice was hoarse with emotion; the tears were running down his cheeks as his chest rose and fell.\n\n“The details are coming up,” he said presently, trying to control himself. “I can see the lighted candles and the flowers … her hair, which was so beautiful … the hands of which she was so proud … and the little white rosary that I found in her Book of Hours … My God, how it hurts to see it all again, yet somehow it makes me happy … very happy … I shall see her once again, my poor darling …”\n\nFeeling that emotion was overcoming him and wishing to soothe, I said: “Don’t you think the plate is ready now ?”\n\nHe held it up near the lamp, examined it closely and put it back in the bath. After a short interval he drew it out afresh, re-examined it, and again put it back, murmuring:\n\n“No … no …”\n\nSomething in the tone of his voice and the abruptness of his gesture struck me, but I had no time to think, as he at once began to speak again.\n\n“There are still some details to come up … It’s rather long, but, as I told you, my developer is weak … so they only come up one by one.”\n\nHe counted: “One … two … three … four … five … This time it will do. If I force it, I shall spoil it …”\n\nHe took out the plate, waved it vertically up and down, dipped it in clean water, and held it towards me: “Look.”\n\nBut as I was stretching out my hand, he started and bent forward, holding the plate up to the lamp, and his face, lit up by the light, had suddenly become so ghastly that I cried:\n\n“What is it? What’s the matter?”\n\nHis eyes were fixed in a wide, terrified stare, his lips were drawn back and showed teeth that were chattering; I could hear his heart beating in a way that made his whole body rock backwards and forwards.\n\nI put my hand on his shoulder, and unable to imagine what could possibly cause such terrible anguish, I cried for the second time:\n\n“But what is it? Tell me. What’s the matter?”\n\nHe turned his face to me, so drawn it no longer seemed human and, as his blood-shot eyes looked into mine, he seized me by the wrist with a grip that sent his nails into my flesh.\n\nThrice he opened his mouth, trying to speak, then brandishing the plate above his head, he shrieked into the crimson-lit darkness:\n\n“The matter! … the matter! … My God! … I have murdered her! … She wasn’t dead! … the eyes have moved! …”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

Ah, m’sieu, even now I can see the way that man lay there, the knife blade gleaming — what of it was not buried in his heart, and feel the cold fear that crept down my back. Ugh! But I should not dare tell this story to even you, m’sieu, was I not very sure you could never find the place.\n\nIt was a bitter night, m’sieu, that I was caught in a storm up in the Height-of-Land country. Even the oldest woodsman is fooled sometimes, and the storm came up even quicker than I had expected, catching me many miles from my cabin.\n\nI thought I knew my trap line well, but after dark, when the snow devils build strange shapes out of the drifts, then tear them down again like children knock over play houses to make something else, familiar landmarks look queer and unnatural.\n\nI had no compass and the stars were smothered by the clouds that shook loose the snow that floated down, swirling, steady, suffocating, filling up trails and leavening valleys until the northland was one great white plain with no end and no beginning.\n\nAh, m’sieu, for long hours I floundered helplessly in that night of terrible whiteness, utterly bewildered. The soft snow underfoot, clinging in the manner of new fallen flakes, seemed to be tugging at my boots, striving to pull me down. And the hard sleet pellets that flew through the air in a straight line stung my eyes till I was almost blinded and cut my face till the blood came. Then the frost crept in and seamed my skin with great, aching cracks.\n\nIt is a terrible thing to be lost in the north country in a storm such as raced in a mad dance that night. The cold was a cruel, searching thing, that crept into one’s bones and sucked at the marrow.\n\nI stumbled along blindly, hour after hour, and always that terrible cold clawed at my vitals and always I could hear the wind devils howling like hungry wolves, eager for their prey. My throat burned from thirst, and each time I thrust a handful of snow in my mouth it was dry like chalk dust and I blew it out still unmoistened.\n\nI knew I was far off my trap line, wandering somewhere far into the lonely north, but I was even farther than I thought. Many times I fell, and each time it was longer before I got up. As I lay in the snow a strange warmth would creep over me and I grew drowsy — why not sleep, I thought; after all, what did it matter? And I knew that soon I should fall and not rise again. Then, with the sleep imps tugging at my eyelids until I felt I could no longer resist them, I saw a light.\n\nI tried to cry out for joy, but my throat was so parched I could utter no sound.\n\nI could see that the light was in a little creek, some trapper’s cabin, I thought, and stumbled toward it madly, rubbing my eyes with my fists to keep them open. Twice the light vanished, and each time tears came to my eyes, while I sobbed like a child. Then, each time, a lull in the whirling world of whiteness showed it again. I thought I should never reach it, and was sobbing from despair when suddenly I saw a shadow loom before me and I fell against a door.\n\nThe next moment there was a sudden blaze of light that blinded me and a blast of warm air against my face.\n\nI was conscious of falling forward on a hard floor, and of a woman’s frightened cry. Then all was black.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nI Call It Lost Creek\n\nWhen I regained consciousness my first feeling was of pain, white-hot, searing pain that darted across my face like little streaks of fire. I moved and my whole body responded with a great swell of torture. I could not help but cry out from it, and I heard a quick stir at the other side of the room where I lay in a bunk.\n\nI turned my eyes and saw a cabin typical of the trapper’s shacks scattered throughout the north country, with a rifle over the fireplace where pine sticks blazed, and great bunches of furs hanging on the walls; rich, glossy pelts of marten and fox. Then the girl bent over me.\n\nM’sieu, she was beautiful. She was young, not more than twenty, I thought, and her skin was white like new milk shaded as by rich cream from wind and sun. Her lips I should have sworn were painted had not the cut of her belted dress and the way her black hair was piled loose on her head told me here was a girl who knew little of civilization. She was a wild thing of the woods, sweet and beautiful like the flowers. The hand she laid on my head was soft and cool, and, m’sieu, I swear it, under that touch the pain left as snow melts before the breath of the Chinook in the spring.\n\n“Where am I?” I asked.\n\n“You are safe,” she half whispered the words, and threw a nervous glance over her shoulder toward the door.\n\nThen she smiled, but still I saw fear in her eyes.\n\nShe brought me hot broth then, and scalding tea, that loosened a little the grip of the frost devils in my body and set the blood flowing more freely. But still I could not get up, for my legs were swollen and aching with the rheumatism in them. The cold of the north does not easily let go its grip.\n\nThat day I lay and watched the girl move about the cabin working, cooking over the small stove in one corner, sewing, or turning drying pelts that hung on the walls. But always she seemed listening, and at each sound at the door she started nervously.\n\nOften she would press her face to the window glass, striving to pierce the terrible murky whiteness outside. For the storm still tore on in its mad dance, and made the day almost dark as night so that the lamp had to be kept burning. And as I lay there watching the girl, who every now and then threw a half fearful glance at me, or staring at the smoked rafters of the roof, I had a feeling that here in this cabin I had stumbled on some mystery of the north — which hides so much that is terrible and tragic.\n\nThe wind screeched mournfully over the chimney and I got to fancying that at times it laughed, yes, m’sieu, actually laughed, like some fiend that watches and waits for the enacting of tragedy to satisfy its bloodthirsty humor. And I wondered what it was out in that white storm that the girl feared.\n\nThe day wore on, and again the great darkness stole over the north country and blotted out the dim light that filtered through the falling snow. And with the night the girl’s nervousness and fears seemed to increase. The frost in my body was so loosened now that I could turn and watch her better. Several times I tried to draw her into conversation, then, after awhile, she came and sat by my bed.\n\n“M’sieu,” she said, watching me with her great dark eyes, “how — how did you come here?”\n\nThere was that same fear in her voice, and something else I did not know, whether hope or merely wonder.\n\nThen I told her how I had got caught in the storm and became lost, stumbling upon the cabin by accident.\n\n“Ah,” she sighed, when I had finished. “You are the first, m’sieu, to find it. Yes … “\n\nShe went on at my look of wonder.\n\n“There is but one person in the world besides myself who knows this cabin is here. Even I do not know the way out of this hidden country — Lost Creek, I call it.”\n\nThe door rattled then and her face went suddenly white as the floating flakes outside and she threw a quick look of fear over her shoulder.\n\nShe turned to me again with a little shiver of relief.\n\n“It was only the wind,” she faltered, smiling feebly.\n\nI raised myself on my elbow then, and seized her hand that lay on my bunk, like the hand of a child that seeks company in the dark.\n\n“Listen, mam’selle!” I cried, “tell me what is it you fear?”\n\n“Oh, no, no, please, m’sieu, I cannot!”\n\nShe drew away with fear alive in her eyes.\n\nBut I was persistent, and, woman-like, in her heart she did want to confide in someone, and then — she told me.\n\nShe was an orphan, left when she was very small in the care of an uncle, who had always been what people call queer. She told how she had known him to sit for a whole day at a time, silent and moody, taking no note of what went on about him. In the winters he trapped, but he made no friends and, in fact, so much as was possible, avoided contact with other people.\n\nShe loved him, for he was her only relative, and cared for him tenderly. And though there were other people who were inclined to be frightened of him, he was like a child in her hands. A great affection for her grew in his heart as the years went on, and he came to be restless and uneasy whenever she was out of his sight, as though he was afraid he should lose her.\n\nThey lived, the two of them, far up in the Height-of-Land country a many days’ journey from any post. But I have said she was beautiful. M’sieu, do you know there is about a beautiful woman something that draws men, even from great distances, like gold? Ah, m’sieu, nature cannot long hide her two greatest treasures.\n\nSo it was that a lover came. He was a trapper, who stopped at the cabin one spring as he was on his way south with his winter’s catch of furs, and there he saw the girl — her name? Ah, m’sieu, that I never knew. After all, names matter so little in this world. Those two loved each other from the first, and therefore that summer the young trapper came often to the cabin.\n\nThe uncle saw all this, and there awoke in his mind that latent fear that the only thing that had ever awakened a bit of affection in his heart was to be taken away from him. He threatened the trapper, but the young men of the north are brave. The lover laughed at him. Then the devil that had been brooding in the uncle these years awoke and stirred to life. The man became a maniac, with but one idea In his distorted mind, that to keep the girl from being taken away from him.\n\nIn his young days the uncle had once trapped in a country far to the north, where few men ever go, and in that sad and lonely country there was known to him a hidden creek where one might live for long years and never see so much as a wandering Indian. And it was that one night the girl was awakened from her sleep to find the mad uncle commanding her to rise and come with him.\n\nHe had a canoe packed with their belongings, ready in the river near their cabin. She looked but once into his eyes and saw there the devil light that told her it was useless to resist. She knew he loved her, in his savage, selfish way, and would not harm a hair of her head so long as she obeyed him. But if she did not, she knew he was mad.\n\nWhen morning came they were far up the river, and there were none behind who knew whence they had gone. The girl had tried to leave some message in hope that her lover would find it and follow, but the madman suspected she would try such a ruse, and watched, making it useless.\n\nFor three days they paddled up the river, and the fourth day the uncle transferred all the duffle to the bank and sunk the canoe.\n\nThen for three more days they traveled far up into the north, twisting and turning in strange regions where the girl lost all sense of direction and knew she should never find her way out.\n\nThe fourth day they came to the little cabin on the hidden creek where the uncle had trapped one winter and where no man had been since. He repaired the house and there they lived, the girl desperately hoping that some day her lover, who she knew was scouring the northland searching for her, would find the place.\n\n“Ah, m’sieu,” she said to me, and her dark eyes glowed with the light of faith, “some day he will come, I know!”\n\nThe madman, too, knew the lover would search until he found his sweetheart, or died, and always he watched the rims of the surrounding hills, his hand caressing his gun and the devil light gleaming in his eyes. And gradually there grew up in his heart a hatred of all mankind because one man had dared to covet the only thing he loved. And now, in his perverted mind, he came to fancy all men were leagued together, aiding the lover in his designs. And in his sleep he would mutter terrible threats that boded of evil to whatever man should set foot in the valley.\n\nSo that, m’sieu, was what the girl feared. For the uncle was out running his trap line when the storm broke and now she feared he might return at any time. And if he should come back, and find me?\n\nI tell you as I lay there in that cabin I cursed the frost demons that held me helpless. Sometimes, as I listened to the terrible whine of the storm and felt the cabin shake in its grasp, I thought that perhaps he should not return, that the howling wind wolves would have their prey. But then, in my heart I knew it could not be so, for evil in a man makes him hard to kill.\n\n“If he finds you here, m’sieu sobbed the girl, “he will kill you!”\n\nI tried to quiet her fears, but there were too many in my own heart for my words to be convincing.\n\nThat night I came to know fear. With the girl I started at each sound at the door, and terrible imaginings crept into my mind. The girl sat by the fire and sobbed softly, while I lay awake, watching, listening. And always I could hear those wind devils, laughing, actually laughing. They were waiting.\n\nThen, after a long while, I fell into a fitful sleep and had bad dreams.\n\nIt was with a start that I awoke suddenly, conscious of a man’s voice. Ah, that voice was born of the wind devils that howled outside in mad glee. Deep and rolling, it was savage like a maddened bull moose’s. But rising above it, high-pitched and stabbing like a dagger, I heard a woman’s frightened scream. I opened my eyes and for an instant I saw the girl, back to me, struggling fiercely beside my bed, and heard her crying desperately.\n\n“No, no, uncle, you shall not harm him, you shall not —!”\n\n“Found us, eh,” I heard the rumbling bellow of the bull-like voice, “think he’s going to steal you for that damned young upstart, eh? A-h-h, we’ll see!”\n\nThen he laughed, laughed like the bloodthirsty wind devils outside.\n\nSuddenly the girl was flung aside and I saw a towering hulk of a man looming over me, huge, foreboding, like a great pine tree towers over one in the dusk.\n\nHis face was close to mine, and, after these many years, I can see that face even now … and shudder as I did then! It was a round, evil face, with a black beard that fell almost to the great chest, and with long, shaggy eyebrows. But it was the eyes that ^ere so terrible, gleaming with the light of the devil. They were the eyes of a madman.\n\nHe laughed again, then, and I felt his rank, tobacco-laden breath on my face.\n\n“So!” he cried, “you came at last, eh? But you shall not go, see!”\n\nAnd as he raised his hand I caught the gleam of the knife.\n\nThen I forgot I was weak with rheumatism, forgot the frost demons that held me down, and with a mighty effort tried to rise. The devils that still lurked in my bones growled, and sank their claws afresh in my vitals. I gave a cry, and fainted even as I saw the reflection of the firelight running up and down the knife blade in glittering streaks. But before I went I heard a strange thing, heard it dimly as in a dream.\n\nIt was the girl’s voice, high-strung and poignant, and there was no fear in it, but a gripping something that came from the heart. She was crying out a name, madly, hysterically.\n\n“Jean, Jean!”\n\nThat, m’sieu-eu, was all I heard.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nTwo Trails In The Snow\n\nWhen I again came to, I was lying on the bunk, as before, and for a moment I thought I must have been dreaming.\n\nThen I saw the pine fire blazing, and noticed the hearth was piled high with sticks, in the manner of a fire stocked to last a long while, and at the side of my bed a small table held food enough for several meals. I also felt that my face had been freshly treated with grease and bandaged.\n\nI moved cautiously and found that the frost devils had loosened their hold on me and I could use my muscles freely. Soon, I knew, I should be well as ever.\n\nThen, I missed something. It was the howling of the wind wolves outside, and I knew the storm had finished its mad dance and blown its life away.\n\nThen, with a start, I thought of the girl, and the madman, and the glittering knife. I called, but no one answered. Yet I felt there was some presence besides myself in that room.\n\nI raised myself on my elbow and, ah, I shall never forget what I saw, or the cold fear that ran down my back like an icy finger as I looked.\n\nHe lay there on the floor in the center of the cabin, the madman, and his lips were parted, showing his teeth in a hideous snarl. And his eyes, ah, m’sieu,, the devil had left them, now they were cold and colorless, like the ice on the frozen rivers. But what fascinated me was the knife that gleamed — what of it was not buried in his heart, and the blood that was thickened in a little pool at his side.\n\nI got one leg out of the bunk, then the other, and staggered to my feet. For a long while I stared at the horrible thing lying there on the floor, with the hideous snarl frozen on the lips, then again I thought of the girl. I stumbled to the door and threw it open. For a moment I saw only the great snow field that stretched off to the horizon, dazzling white in the sunlight. Then I saw something else.\n\nM’sieu, what I am going to tell you may sound strange, but I swear by the saints it is true.\n\nYou may say that providence does not bring about such coincidences as to lead a heart-broken lover, wandering over the northland, to a hidden cabin on a stormy night just in time to — ah, say what you will, m’sieu, I swear it is true, that there, streaking off across the white plain, like twin threads, I saw two trails, a man’s and a woman’s, that spun away toward the south, where they merged with the horizon haze in the distance.\n\nThere is little else to tell. My strength came back quickly, as it does to us who live outdoors, and so soon as I was strong enough I dug a grave back of the cabin, and there I buried the madman, with the hideous snarl frozen on his lips.\n\nThe second day I packed provisions and followed the two trails that spun away toward the south. And so treacherous was the country that I had gone but a few miles until, looking back, I was sure I should not be able to again find the hidden creek, were the trails obliterated. Lost Creek, the girl called it, and it was well named. Nevertheless, I carried with me the knife I had drawn from the madman’s heart, and which I had seen was not his own. Three days later I threw it through an airhole into the racing Asthasbasca, where the two trails I had followed ended on the clear ice of the wind-swept river. Then, with my sense of direction restored, I turned toward my own country.\n\nThat, m’sieu, is all I know of the matter.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

For instance, ever since these courthouse characters where Pop used to work as a legman, ever since they framed him up the river, Pop is telling me, Georgie, he sez—says—you got to do like the Law tells you to do, just as if you was grown up and could get sent to the Pen.\n\nAnd now Bennie, my brother-in,law, who is a attorney-at-law, my sister having got tired listening to Pop and decided to get the straight dope, now Bennie says I am an infant according to the Book, and that I got to do things different from the way grown up people do sometimes, and this is all very confusing.\n\nNow the thing is, I got lots of contacts here on Cherry Street, and I got my good name as a business man to think of, too, so it is very discouraging at this point to find out for instance that I cannot sign my name to a contract and have it mean something, and my word is worthless because I am a legal infant.\n\nOur gang has always gone strictly by contracts, on account my old man had beat this idea into me, and I seen to it, or rather me and my pal Muggsy, we seen—saw to it, together, that our gang did not act like Dead End Kids, we always went according to the Book, and always wrote out contracts when there was something important, like money, in the deal; and this is OK as long as it is strictly between us but it looks now like all our contracts is about as good as Hitler’s treaties was, and are only scraps of paper, like they say on the radio, on account the Law says we are all only infants, and our names do not mean a thing.\n\nIn some ways, it is good now that I know this, but I will say I could have saved a lot of trouble for Muggsy and I if I had known it before; and I would still have my good name, which without it I can not be a successful business man. I figured I had this contract business solid after the first time I make a mistake. This time, Muggsy and me, we thought we was being pretty smart, in spite of being honest. There is a very nasty guy on our block, name of Gink Fordham. Gink is what he was always been called, although he has a name like Sommers or something, but Gink is what he is called, because he is such a gink and always was one, even when he was no higher than the front stoop.\n\nWell this Gink, he is a year, two, younger than Muggsy and me and an awful pain in the neck. He is always making fun of the Law, and says we are a couple of dopes who would not be able to go according to the Book no matter how hard we tried, because he sez it is full of tricks that only a lawyer could figure out, and furthermore that all lawyers are crooks. I cannot let him get away with that, on account Benny being married to my sister.\n\nWell, Muggsy an’ me, we had to take care of this junior G-man, so we get on to something that we was sure would get him, and that is still strictly legal. We got the angle one day when we was waiting around old man Hoffman’s where we get a job sometimes delivering groceries, end Gink’s ma was in there shootin’ off her mouth to the neighbors about her angel boy, an’ she says she don’t know what to do because her darling cannot stand the smell of cooking cabbage and gets sick from it, and the neighbors in the flat downstairs are forever cookin’ cabbage; the smell comes up through the air shaft, and she can’t shut the window on account the heat.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nAn Awful Pain in the Neck\n\nMuggsy and me, we look at each other, and right away I know he got the same idea I got. We go take us a little stroll by the fruit market, and Muggsy walks by and there is a cabbage on the ground, on account he walked too close, and I find it on the ground, which is strictly legal, on account if you find something it aint—isn’t—the same as stealing it, and I found this here cabbage. We take it up to my place, on account Muggsy’ ma would’ve asked too many questions, and boil it up good—just a piece of it, that is, saving the rest for other days.\n\nNow this Gink, he delivers newspapers, and he has a regular route he got to go on every morning. Well Muggsy and me, we get up early the next morning after that cabbage is cooked good, and put each of us a little piece in a paper bag, and we go take us another stroll right along Gink’s route, maybe a half a dozen feet ahead of Gink. He was trying to lose us, we could see that, but as slow as he went, we could go slower, and he had to get his papers out, so he had to walk behind us all the way, an’ it was a nice hot summer day, too.\n\nNext day we do the same, and the day after, and Gink, he knew what it was all about. But there wasn’t anything the poor gink could go about it. It is a free country, and we have as much a right to walk around town with a paper bag full of cooked cabbage as this Gink has to deliver his papers, And he got to deliver the papers, too, so he is stuck.\n\nWell, we didn’t say nothin’ to him, we just waited. And after a few more days of this, Gink is beginning to turn pale green just at the sight of us, an’ finally, he come up to us one day when we had left the cabbage bags at home, on account we was all slicked up for a date with a couple sweet chicks from the next block, and he sez, Georgie, he sez, I will make a deal. We look like we do not know what he is talking about, until he come out and says, I know I have been antagganizin’ you, and I will not do it any more, if you will only stop following me around with cabbage.\n\n“Who’s been following who?” we sez. “We notice you seem to be behind us every time we go out for a pleasure stroll in the morning lately.\n\n“Muggsie” he sez, because he knows Muggsie got a softer heart than me—“Muggsie, will you please believe me, I will not talk about Georgie’s Pop any more, or about lawyers.”\n\nWell, we finally make a deal with him, and we make him go down with us to the Cherry Street Boys’ Club where we got a basement club room for our gang, and we got paper and pens and everything for a contract, and he signs on the dotted line that he will not say anything more like he was saying, and that furthermore, whereas he had been a chief offender in the past, he would henceforth tell us should anybody he knew make any remarks of the same nature.\n\nSo he signed, and we did, and it was a contract.\n\nCouple weeks after, we hear of a kid shootin’ off about lawyers and about our gang, the Cherry Street Boys’ Club, going always according to the Book, and this Gink was standing around and didn’t do nothing. Well, this is breach of contract, and we could sue him for it, and so we went to see Bennie, and to find out for sure, on account there have been too many times before when we was ready to sue somebody, and found out after we made public laughingstocks of ourselves that we were wrong.\n\n(To find out what Bennie said, see Chapter 4 - WHAT BENNIE TOLD GEORGIE. Did they, or did they not have a contract? Forget about the underage ; this is strictly between us boys.)\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nGettin’ Straightened Out\n\nWell, after Bennie got us all straightened out, and we had found out everything all about contracts, this other business come along that has left me so discouraged. Like I said I got contacts in this neighborhood, and I have built up a pretty fair name for myself as a guy who can be depended on if he ses he can produce anything. And now Sandy Malone is going around tearing down my reputation, and I do not see what I can do about it, because he is absolutely right, and I cannot go around telling people what a dope I was and that I did not know, but from now on I am not going into any other people’s business, but will stick strictly to two-party deals.\n\nThis Sandy Malone he runs the bowling alley down the corner, and he ask me one day did I want to be a pin boy. Well I did not care to do anything so warm in the summertime, but I did manage to locate some suckers for him, an after a while he come to depend on me to replace them as they dropped out, because it is quite some job down there on a hot day.\n\nWell, all the kids knew I was working practically as personnel manager for Sandy. He didn’t pay me nothin’, but I could bowl free any time there was an empty alley, an’ this kind of exercise I like better than setten em up. Sandy was happy, cause he knew I knew which kids could be trusted, on account there’s a lot of portable stuff around a bowling alley. Well, like I said, all the kids knew I was the in-between man for Sandy Malone if they wanted to do any business with him. Then one day Johnnie Graumeier comes to me with a business proposition.\n\nJohnnie is a pretty old guy. He’s almost twenty-one, and he has been running a sort of second-hand business, buying and selling stuff, ever since he got his working papers. He says he has seen Malone about this deal, but as Malone does not know him, he will not okay it unless I say the word. Malone says I am his gent or something, and if I give the word Johnny is okay, the deal is on.\n\nWell, I have known Johnnie a long time, and I know he has been dealing in small stuff, so I was a little surprised to find out what he wants to sell Malone is a complete refreshment counter. He will bring all the fittings and fixings, only he will not install it, but he’s giving it away practically, he sez, it’s so cheap. Like said, I was surprised to find him up in this half-agrand-class, but I use to know him pretty well, a few years back, though I have not seen much of him lately, and I figure he’s okay. I am very flattered too, that Malone thinks so much of my judgment, so after I think about it a while, and ask around to see if anybody knows if he’s been mixed up in anything I don’t know about, I give Malone the go-ahead.\n\nWell, everything went fine, right up to the end. Johnny delivered this here fountain and counter, and it sure was a beaut, and worth a lot more than the five hundred Malone was paying. He collected his dough, and the next day, just as Sandy was starting to install it, on account of being too cheap to have some carpenters do it for him, Johnny comes around and says he wants it back.\n\n“What the H—?” sez Sandy.\n\nJohnny says, “You got to give it back, and here is your money.”\n\n“This is oney three hundred,” sea Sandy.\n\nJohnny sez, that’s right, and you got to give it back anyhow, because I am a minor, and I have spent the other two hundred and do not have it anymore, I find I do not have legal right to this property I have sold you and must return it.\n\nI was hangin’ around that day, and Sandy turns at me, and sez, “What’s goin’ on here? What you got to do with this?”\n\nBut I was just standin there with my mouth open, an after Sandy got all done bawlin’ me out, I ran an got Bennie.\n\n(What Bennie told Georgie this time is in the next chapter. You’re in for a surprise.)\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nWhat Bennie Told Georgie\n\n(1) This agreement signed by Gink and Georgie and Muggsy was not a contract, no matter how old the three were, first of all because it was onesided, and a court will always hold up to question an agreement whereby one party performs a service for another, with no expressed return. More important, however, is the fact that this agreement concerns a moral obligation, since no exchange of money is involved, but only a normally friendly service, Gink cannot be held legally responsible. If Georgie had promised to do a similar service for Gink, the first objection would be satisfied, but the second would hold true.\n\n(2) Although they had not signed anything, Malone and Johnny had made a contract, but only Malone was bound by it. The law does some peculiar things where minors are concerned. Although in this case, Johnny’s intentions were clearly dishonest, the law assumes that a minor is not sufficiently clearheaded to pull off a deal like this, and would interpret the whole exchange as though Johnny had made a sale he did not fully intend, then, after spending some of the money, wanted to revoke the sale, and he would be allowed to get his goods back in return for what part of the money he still had. The object of the law is to discourage contracts with minors, since in the large majority of cases, if anyone was cheated, it would be the minor.\n\nIncidentally, contrary to popular opinion, Johnny’s parents would not be liable for the other two hundred dollars. They would be liable only if they were present at the scene of the transaction or if Johnny were in some way engaged on some errand or job for them at the time that he made the deal.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

He had just finished a meal which exactly suited his epicurean tastes. The Early Bird had shared the same delicious meal, but food could not appease his gnawing appetite for an adventure; it had been some weeks now since the master confidence man had engaged in that always interesting pastime of dollar hunting.\n\n“Ah, James,” murmured Mr. Clackworthy, “that filet of sole was ambrosia fit for the gods.”\n\n“Huh!” grunted The Early Bird. “Th’ kinda fish I’m interested in right now is—suckers. Come on, boss; bait th’ hook an’ let’s give some dollar-grabbin’ goof th’ chance t’ nibble.”\n\nMr. Clackworthy smiled tolerantly.\n\n“James,” he complained good-naturedly, “you are certainly a restless soul. It seems that you can never declare a truce with careless bank balances.”\n\n“Aw, what’s th’ use of havin’ a wise noodle like yours if you don’t use it? When a guy’s got a money-makin’ think-tank, he’s gotta keep it oiled or it’s gonna get rusty.”\n\n“Unfortunately, James,” and the master confidence man smiled, “I do seem to get a bit rusty at times. Just now, for instance, I have thumbed my list of prospects in vain; I don’t seem to be able to get hold of a single lead. At that I am not sorry, for I am getting terribly behind in my reading.”\n\nThe Early Bird groaned as there arose before him the dismal picture of Mr. Clackworthy sitting in the library of his Sheridan Road apartment for countless hours, nose buried between the covers of some classical volume; he was very jealous of the masters, for they took much of the time which, so James told himself, could be so much more profitably turned to more practical matters.\n\nHowever, what further entreaty The Early Bird might have been about to make was abruptly sidetracked as his gaze wandered to the hotel entrance and paused at the sight of an arriving guest.\n\n“Holy pink elephants!” he exclaimed in Mr. Clackworthy’s ear. “There’s ‘Chicago Charlie!’ He must be getting’ up in th’ world, stoppin’ at this swell joint.”\n\n“One of your erstwhile friends, I presume, James,” responded Mr. Clackworthy. He referred to his coworker’s former days, when The Early Bird was not above burgling a safe or turning his hand to various other violent means of annexing the coin which are frowned upon by the law.\n\n“Friend!” sputtered The Early Bird. “Boss, of course I forgive you for you don’t know Chicago Charlie, but that is sure an insult. That guy a friend of mine? Ain’tcha ever heard of Chicago Charlie? But then I forgot that you didn’t used t’ pal around with th’ same bunch I did.\n\n“Honest, boss, I’ve got every respect in th’ world for a square crook; y’ know what I mean. But that goof is so crooked that he’d make a corkscrew look as straight as a yardstick. He’s so crooked he’s gotta read a paper upside down. Alongside Chicago Charlie, Jesse James would of got a bid t’ this here Diogenes guy’s party fer honest homos.”\n\n“Your vehemence piques my interest.” Mr. Clackworthy chuckled, casting a glance of interest to the big, heavy-jowled man who had now reached the clerk’s desk and was writing his name in the hotel register. “Suppose you tell me something about him. I judge that he must have—er —nicked you for your roll, as you would say.”\n\n“I’ve sure got th’ old bowie knife all whetted up for that guy,” said The Early Bird. “Th’ only time I ever beat th’ ponies for a hundred-to-one shot this here Charlie was makin’ book out t’ th’ old Chicago race track. A friend slips me some live dope about a little spindle-legged filly what looked like she was sufferin’ from th’ sleepin’ sickness. So I parks a century into Chicago Charlie’s keepin’. An’ believe me, boss, them was th’ days when a five spot looked as big as th’ State of Kansas.\n\n“Well, this little mare grasshopper gets t’ th’ home stretch about three train lengths ahead of th’ field, an’ I stands t’ collect ten thousand smackers from Chicago Charlie’s betting emporium. Does I get it? Huh! I got it all right—in th’ neck. Charlie skips out an’ grabs th’ first rattler for parts unknown! I don’t even get my century back.\n\n“Aw, I ain’t th’ only guy that was handed th’ double cross by him. Before he blowed th’ race track that time he’d been mixed up in a coupla dozen crooked races.”\n\n“It must have been some years, then, since you have seen him,” remarked Mr. Clackworthy.\n\n“It does credit to your memory, James. If I am any judge, this Charlie person has now risen considerably above the level of a crooked bookmaker. He carries himself with that assurance which belongs to a man of affairs.”\n\n“Well, y’ can lay good odds that he’s with a gang of counterfeiters, or head of a trust what’s got th’ monopoly on stealin’ pennies outta blind men’s cups or somethin’ like that,” retorted The Early Bird spitefully. He was staring at Chicago Charlie’s luggage, his brow wrinkled in deep thought.\n\n“If he ain’t swiped some goof’s baggage—which wouldn’t surprise me none —he’s changed his moniker,” he said. “See them initials—‘J. H.,’ they says; an’ in th’ days when I knowed him, his name was Charlie Batterson. Yeah; them’s his grips aw’right. He’s pointin’ ‘em out t’ th’ bell hop. It says ‘J. M., Swaneetown, Indiana.’ “\n\nMr. Clackworthy referred to his carefully card-indexed memory.\n\n“Swaneetown, eh?” he murmured. “If I mistake not, James, that is the name of the town which has enjoyed such a spectacular boom of late. A number of factories have erected large plants there; it is something less than a hundred miles from here, I believe. No doubt, James, Charlie is doing quite well. Humph!”\n\nThe master confidence man lowered his eyelids meditatively and thoughtfully tugged at the neatly trimmed point of his Vandyke beard.\n\n“James,” he said slowly, “it may be that our dining here this evening was nothing short of providential. Who knows but that we may be able to find a way whereby we can collect this old debt which Chicago Charlie owes you—with appropriate interest and—humph —an adequate fee for my services as a collector.”\n\n“Boss!” exclaimed The Early Bird eagerly. “Y’ ain’t stringin’ me? Honest, boss, will ya throw th’ old harpoon into that guy, will ya?”\n\n“It’s a bad idea, James, to weigh your fish before you have so much as baited your hook,” responded Mr. Clackworthy cautiously, “but we most certainly shall look into this little matter.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nChicago Charlie\n\n“Chicago Charlie has certainly developed into a most shrewd person,” remarked Mr. Clackworthy as, from the window in his room of The Swaneetown House, he stared across the nondescript business street which was cluttered with all sorts of building material such as marks a growing town in the making.\n\n“Meanin’,” said The Early Bird with a discouraged sigh, “that you ain’t been able t’ figger out th’ ways an’ means of liftin’ a bunch of his kale.”\n\n“You have correctly stated the matter, James,” replied the master confidence man, “but, to paraphrase a bit of sound philosophy, where there is money there is always hope—of getting some of it.\n\n“I have now spent some hours making guarded inquiries regarding our debtor. As you know, he has buttoned the cloak of respectability tightly about bis shoulders. He has taken unto himself the name of John Harley, and he is president of the bank of Swaneetown. He came here when the boom started and purchased considerable portions of real estate for practically a song.\n\n“He has become a power in municipal politics through his money and the strangle hold which he has gotten on local affairs. I understand that all of the city officials literally eat from his hand. In addition to being president of the bank, he has numerous other investments. He has developed into a shrewd business man, and not any too scrupulous, I take it.\n\n“He is, I judge, an extremely suspicious man, which will make it very difficult for me to win his confidence—the first necessity, of course, if I am to reduce the plethora of his roll.”\n\n“So y’ gotta call it off, huh?” The Early Bird said mournfully.\n\n“Did you ever know me to quit, James?” reproved Mr. Clackworthy. “I did not intend to deluge your hopes with the cold water of discouraging facts; I merely reported the situation as I have found it. It really makes the game only the more interesting. I have not quit, old dear; I have just begun.\n\n“These facts which I have recited to you I have gathered about town. I am going over to Harley’s bank—we might as well respect his alias for the present —and open up an account.”\n\n“Gonna put your kale in Chicago Charlie’s bank?” demanded The Early Bird. “Don’cha do it. We come down here t’ trim him, not t’ let him trim us; remember what I told y’ about him goin’ south with my ten thousand smackers. Keep your dough in your own kick; it’s safer.”\n\n“Tut, James; the bank is perfectly safe. All banks are protected by State guarantees these days. And a clever fellow like Chicago Charlie isn’t going to risk wrecking a bank. I’ll be back presently and I may, perchance, have discovered his vulnerable point.”\n\nFollowing the principle that nothing succeeds like success, Mr. Clackworthy had long since discovered that the most powerful magnet to attract money was —money. In pursuance thereof he had brought along a generous working capital.\n\nEntering the bank of Swaneetown, the master confidence man found John Harley seated in front of an elaborate mahogany desk within the open, brass-railed space adjoining the tellers’ cages. The banker who had once answered to the name of Chicago Charlie was a big, heavy-jawed man, florid and beefy. He had learned the trick of narrowing his eyes to mere slits until he was like a man peering through a crack in a window blind; he could look into a face without giving any hint of his own emotions. It rather gave the impression of a man asleep, except for the glinting of the light against his curtained retina. His mind was very much awake.\n\n“My name is Clackworthy,” explained the master confidence man; “I wish to open an account with your bank; it will be small for the present —only ten thousand dollars.”\n\n“Check?” demanded the self-styled Mr. Harvey with bankerlike caution; unintroduced strangers who opened accounts with checks were, of course, open to inquiry.\n\n“Cash,” replied Mr. Clackworthy just as briefly.\n\n“Aw right,” said Harley. “Glad to have your account. Thinking of going into business in Swaneetown?”\n\n“That remains to be decided.” Mr. Clackworthy smiled. He was aware that Chicago Charlie, through his half-closed eyes, was subjecting him to the most minute scrutiny. And he realized with a vague feeling of discouragement that fooling Chicago Charlie was going to prove a difficult task. The man was, without doubt, suspicious and practical; he had learned caution in the hard school of life, where the lessons are not easily forgotten.\n\nAnd, had he known the thoroughness of the banker’s classification, Mr. Clackworthy would have been still further discouraged.\n\n“A fox, this fellow,” was Harley’s appraisal. “Can’t sell him any real estate at inflated values; can’t sell him any stock that isn’t on the level. Can’t be picked for a sucker; no use wasting any time on him.”\n\nWhich was a disappointment to Chicago Charlie; every newcomer who deposited money in the bank of Swaneetown was at once sized up with a view to swelling the size of the Harley exchequer. Straightway he decided that it was going to be a cold day in August when he would try to do business with this Mr. Clackworthy.\n\nAnd the master confidence man, with that intuitive sixth sense of his, realized at least a small part of Chicago Charlie’s skittish distrust. It would have to be a most unusual trap indeed that would lure Banker Harley.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Early Bird!\n\nIt really could not be considered strange, inasmuch as The Early Bird had instantly recognized Chicago Charlie after nearly fifteen years, that Chicago Charlie, in turn, should recognize The Early Bird. The bank president had dropped into the Swaneetown House for lunch.\n\nGlancing across the dining room, he nodded politely to Mr. Clackworthy as is due a man who has deposited ten thousand dollars in cash the day before. Almost at the same instant he got a good look at Mr. Clackworthy’s companion. He started unpleasantly.\n\n“The Early Bird!” he murmured, for James Early had, after all, changed very little since the time when the police were considerably interested in his movements and when James, with the capital which he had secured through extremely dubious methods, had been a regular patron at the race track.\n\nNow the self-styled John Harley congratulated himself that he had successfully erased the unsavory pages of his past. In physical appearance he had changed a good deal; his body had thickened, his face was more full, older. After his sudden disappearance from his betting stall at the Chicago race track he had gone far West; he thought that he had thoroughly done away with Chicago Charlie. As he stared covertly at The Early Bird he detected The Early Bird looking just as covertly at him; and something told him that there was recognition in James’ eyes.\n\nThe Early Bird pressed Mr. Clackworthy’s foot beneath the table.\n\n“He’s lamped me, boss,” he whispered. “He’s jerry t’ me.”\n\nMr. Clackworthy frowned in annoyance; he had thoughtlessly neglected to take into consideration the possibility that Chicago Charlie would dine at their hotel. It had not been his intention that the banker should see him and his coworker together.\n\nBanker Harley hurried through his meal, keeping his face averted. He left the hotel and went back to his bank. For half an hour he sat, pudgy hands folded across his expansive waistcoat, chewing a dead cigar; he was thinking many unpleasant thoughts.\n\nIt was, of course, possible that he had been mistaken; that The Early Bird had not recognized him at all. Also, it was barely possible that The Early Bird carried with him no spirit of revenge, and perhaps even forgotten the incident of the welched hundred-to-one shot so many years before.\n\nAnd what if The Early Bird had not forgotten or forgiven and did tell what he knew? He could brazen it out, deny that he was the former race-track booky in case The Early Bird did show a vindictive spirit; surely his word would be accepted against that of a former safe blower. But even at the best, it was an unpleasant business, would shake the local confidence in his bank if the story got abroad. If the story was believed, it might even force his resignation as president of the institution.\n\nThe crux of the whole trouble, the thing that made it so dangerous was that Chicago Charlie had not always been so wise and so cautious as he now was. He had done some very foolish things at various and sundry times, with the result that the police had “mugged” him. If the thing got far enough for that to leak out—He shuddered at the thought.\n\nPresently Banker Harley arrived at a decision and reached for the telephone and called “Swaneetown twenty,” which was the police station. He even chuckled a little at the cleverness of his inspiration.\n\n“Givney,” he said to the chief of police, “I want you to come over to the bank right away.”\n\nChief Givney came and lost no time about it; Harvey’s political machine had put him in office. The banker led Givney back to the private office and closed the door.\n\n“Givney,” he grunted, “you want to continue to hold your job, don’t you?” The chief, looking a bit frightened, nodded vigorously.\n\n“Aw right, Givney, it’s up to you. You do what I say—and keep your mouth shut. Understand?” Again the chief nodded.\n\n“Now, Givney, you listen to me, and do what I tell you; your job depends on it.”\n\nGivney listened.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Game of Poker\n\n“Boss,” said The Early Bird as he and Mr. Clackworthy sat in the lobby of the Swaneetown House, “somethin’ seems t’ tell me that we ain’t gonna trim Chicago Charlie for so much as a solitary Lincoln. Le’s grab th’ rattler for th’ big burg.”\n\n“Not for another day or so, James,” responded Mr. Clackworthy. “We must not accept defeat so easily; I will admit “\n\nHe paused as a man sauntered up to them.\n\n“Beg your pardon,” said the stranger. “You two fellows look as if time were hanging heavily on your hands, and I’m trying to drum up a little poker game. Oh, I’m not a professional; three of the boys are willing but three-handed draw is a little like tiddlewinks, you know. Thought I’d invite you to sit in.”\n\nMr. Clackworthy gave the man a swift glance of appraisal; certainly he was not a professional card sharper, and besides he was himself no novice at the game. He liked poker, and it offered a welcomed opportunity to pass away a few hours.\n\n“What do you say, James?” he asked of his coworker.\n\nThe Early Bird eagerly assented, for he was no slouch with the cards even in a professional game.\n\n“I gotcha,” he said. “I’m gonna get th’ chance t’ make expenses on this trip anyhow. Lead th’ way.”\n\nMr. Clackworthy, however, became suddenly alert as he noted the look of satisfaction which flashed over the stranger’s face; he felt instinctively that there was something behind it. His curiosity overcame any cautious misgivings he felt. The stranger led the way upstairs and to one of the ordinary guest rooms. Presently two others joined the party and the game got under way. As poker games go, it was a rather tame business.\n\nThe five had been playing less than an hour when there was a rap at the door. One of the players got from his chair and turned back the key. Instantly the door was shoved open and Chief of Police Givney faced the five players in all of his official sternness.\n\n“You’re pinched,” he announced, “for gamblin’. Line up there; as soon as I get this here evidence together we go down to th’ station.”\n\n“Now don’t that beat the devil!” exclaimed The Early Bird. “Caught with th’ goods—an’ me winner enough t’ buy th’ tickets home!”\n\nMr. Clackworthy knew that it was a frame-up; he and The Early Bird had been deliberately led into this game for the purpose of arrest but, as quick as he was at probing situations, he admitted that the motive proved too deep for him. The other three players took the matter cheerfully enough, as became true sports, and the journey was begun to the police station.\n\nAt the station all five were booked and motioned to a bench.\n\n“I ain’t goin’ to lock you fellows up,” he explained. “I’ll take you over to the police magistrate. Want t’ call a lawyer? It ain’t much use; I got you with th’ evidence, an’ you’ll draw fines anyhow.”\n\nThe police magistrate’s office was directly across the street and, presently, Chief Givney led them thither.\n\nThe arraignment proceeded as is customary in such cases as Chief Givney formally presented his charge, displayed the evidence, and giving his details of his raid—made, he explained, when a guest in the adjoining room had notified him over the telephone that a game was in progress. Quite naturally the five prisoners had no defense.\n\nThe magistrate, a pompous man who took his judicial duties with great seriousness, glared down upon the five offenders.\n\n“There’s been too much gamblin’ goin’ on in this town,” he declared with a nasal twang. “I’ve got to take harsh measures to stamp out this evil. Now, three of these prisoners is home boys, their faces is familiar. I fine these three”—and he read off their names—“ten dollars an’ costs.”\n\nPromptly the three guilty men produced pocketbooks and paid their tines.\n\n“And now,” went on the magistrate, “let’s see about these other two. Strangers in Swaneetown, huh? Professional gamblers, like as not.”\n\nThe Early Bird, enjoying the humor of the situation, shook his head; Mr. Clackworthy, likewise, denied the imputation that he was a professional gambler.\n\n“You’d lie about it anyhow,” retorted the judge witheringly. “Now this man here has got a hard face—a hard face.” He pointed an accusing finger at The Early Bird. “He looks like a criminal t’ me.”\n\nChief Givney stared intently at James and simulated a start of surprise.\n\n“Your honor,” he said, “you are right. This man is a criminal. I remember seem’ his picture in th’ rogue’s gallery in Chicago. I’ve got a good memory; I can even tell you his name. He give th’ name of Brown when I arrested him. His name’s James Early, alias Th’ Early Bird. He’s—a desprit character.”\n\nThe Early Bird’s face paled slightly at this sudden turn of events. Mr. Clackworthy, a police prisoner for the first time in his life, began to understand that Chicago Charlie was at the bottom of this; he had, of course, inspired the raid on the poker game and had supplied Givney with what was now ancient history concerning his coworker. But what was Chicago Charlie’s game? He could not quite fathom it.\n\n“What have you to say for yourself?” the magistrate inquired crisply. The Early Bird floundered for a reply.\n\n“I’ve pleaded guilty t’ gamblin’, ain’t I?” he demanded weakly. “I’m willin’ to fork up th’ coin for th’ fine. Ain’t that enough?”\n\n“I haven’t indicated that I would let you off with a fine,” retorted the judge. “The penalty for this offense is a fine of not less than five dollars nor more than one hundred dollars, or a jail sentence of ninety days, or both. And don’t you talk back to this court! Have you got a police record?”\n\n“I—I want a lawyer,” stammered The Early Bird. “I ain’t gettin’ an even break. I refuse to answer.”\n\n“It’s too late for a lawyer now,” decreed the judge; “you’ve already pleaded guilty; you can’t even appeal from a plea of guilty. So you refuse to answer, eh? That means it’s so.\n\n“You and this other prisoner here are together, huh? I guess you’re both crooks—you look it. If it wasn’t for puttin’ the county to th’ expense of feedin’ a couple of city crooks, I’d give you both the limit. We don’t want crooks like you in our town.\n\n“I fine you each one hundred dollars and costs and three months in jail—and set aside the sentence, providin’ that you buy tickets to Chicago and that th’ chief of police sees you off on the four o’clock train. Call next case.”\n\nThe Early Bird breathed a sigh of relief; he hadn’t realized that a poker game could have such threateningly dangerous consequences. Mr. Clackworthy, however, refused to let the matter end there.\n\n“If the court please,” he said calmly, “I deny your right to attempt to drive my friend and me from town in this fashion. I have a right to remain here, and I shall—even if it be in jail.”\n\nThe Early Bird stared at Mr. Clackworthy in horror.\n\n“Boss!” he whispered hoarsely. “You’ve gone off your onion! For th’ love of Pete—”\n\nMr. Clackworthy smiled cheerfully.\n\n“Wake up, James!” he murmured. “Don’t you see through it? Chicago Charlie did this—he’s afraid of us! We’ve got him where we want him. He’s furnished me with a plan, and I think we’re going to collect, after all. I’ve never been in jail before, old dear, but I wouldn’t let Chicago Charlie get away with this—not for a year in jail.”\n\nThe judge, after sputtering for one speechless moment at Mr. Clackworthy’s surprising stand, found voice.\n\n“Lock him up!” he ordered.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Motive of His Voluntary Incarceration\n\nThe Early Bird, as he always did; bowed to Mr. Clackworthy’s wishes and, likewise, refused to shake the dust of Swaneetown from his new twenty-dollar patent-leather shoes. However, he was forlorn when he learned that he must bide his time to be taken into his master’s confidence as to the motive of his practically voluntary incarceration; they were locked in separate cells.\n\nAs the steel door clanged shut behind him, Mr. Clackworthy, through the bars, proffered the turnkey a neatly folded twenty-dollar bill.\n\n“I want a little information,” he said. “I want to know what kind of a lawyer Edward Stone is?”\n\n“Punk,” replied the turnkey. “He’s just a young fellow and pretty near starvin’ to death, I reckon.”\n\n“What relationship has he to Henry Stone, publisher of the Swaneetown Courier.”\n\n“Brothers they are.”\n\n“So I guessed.” Mr. Clackworthy nodded. “Call up Lawyer Stone for me and tell him that there’s a hundred-dollar retainer fee waiting for him the minute he gets here.”\n\n“Then he’ll get here before I can get the receiver hung up,” shrewdly replied the turnkey.\n\nThe prediction may have failed by a few minutes, but Lawyer Stone did not waste any time. He came back to Mr. Clackworthy’s cell, a neatly shabby man of perhaps thirty. He took the hundred-dollar bill which Mr. Clackworthy gave him, fingering it fondly.\n\n“Stone,” began the master confidence man, “your brother owns The Courier?”\n\n“Yes, but—”\n\n“I happened to be looking over it back in the hotel this morning. I saw your name in the news columns and the boost the paper gave you made me lean to the conclusion that he must be your brother. No, don’t interrupt; all of this is quite pertinent.\n\n“Let me ask you another question: How does your brother and Banker Harley get along?”\n\n“You say this is—pertinent?” exclaimed the attorney. “Maybe so; anyhow, you’ve given me a hundred, and I don’t know any easier way to earn it than hand you out the family secrets. Henry has to get along with Harley; Harley has a mortgage on the paper.”\n\n“And the paper isn’t exactly a newspaper bonanza, I take it,” went on Mr. Clackworthy. “The lack of advertising patronage would indicate that your brother is having a tough time of it.”\n\n“It does look rather sickly, doesn’t it?” agreed the lawyer. “Say, what’s the idea anyhow?”\n\nFor answer, Mr. Clackworthy drew closer to the barred door and whispered into Lawyer Stone’s ear for several minutes. When he had finished the attorney was grinning.\n\n“I’ll talk it over with Henry,” he said. “I am dead sure he’ll do it; it will save the paper for him. Henry would commit murder for three thousand dollars right now. He hasn’t been able to rake up last week’s pay roll.” That same afternoon, less than three hours after the young lawyer’s consultation with Mr. Clackworthy, small boys began to flood the streets of Swaneetown with handbills. They read:\n\n\nA GREAT SENSATION!!!\n\n\nThe Courier takes pleasure in announcing that in its issue to-morrow, and running every week thereafter, it will begin the publication of a sensation series of articles exposing the inside secrets of crooked race track gambling entitled\n\n\nFROM BOOKMAKER TO BANK PRESIDENT.\n\n\nWe guarantee that this series of articles will stir Swaneetown as no other series of newspaper article has ever done. It will describe how a former race-track gambler, who served several jail terms for a number of offenses, changed his name, accumulated a fortune, and became president of a bank.\n\n\nIT STARTS TOMORROW.\n\n\nBanker Harley, otherwise Chicago Charlie, was at his desk when some one, coming in from the street, carried in one of the bills. His eyes lighted on the line in big type “FROM BOOKMAKER TO BANK PRESIDENT.” He gave a violent start and, with trembling fingers, began to read.\n\nHe had already been informed, of course, that Mr. Clackworthy and The Early Bird had refused to leave town; that, of course, puzzled and worried him, but this! How had they done it? There was one consoling thought; he could stopThe Courierfrom printing it. He reached for the phone and called The Courier’ office.\n\n“Stone!” he snapped into the transmitter. “You owe this bank a mortgage for three thousand dollars on your paper. It was due today and you haven’t paid it. I’ll have to foreclose unless you meet that mortgage.”\n\n“Why, Mr. Harley!” exclaimed Stone with apparent innocence. “Why are you so sudden about it?”\n\n“I think you already know,” retorted the banker. “Any man who’s loon enough to flood the town with a lot of ridiculous bills like you’re having distributed this afternoon, isn’t sane enough to get credit at this bank. Of course, if you stopped this foolishness I might—”\n\n“But I couldn’t do that, Mr. Harley,” replied the editor. “I’ve advertised it, you know, and—well, besides, I was just on my way down to pay off the mortgage. I have made other financial arrangements —borrowed the money from a—a Mr. Amos Clackworthy. I’ve got his check drawn on your bank. I’ll be right down.”\n\nChicago Charlie dropped limply back in his chair.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nNo Intention of Blackmailing\n\nBeing a man of average intelligence, Chicago Charlie did not need a diagram to tell him what had happened to him. And he wasted no time; he had a situation to meet and he met it. He hurried to police headquarters and flung himself down into the chair at Chief Givney’s desk.\n\n“Givney,” he commanded, “get an order from the court and bring those two prisoners over here from the jail —and then go away and let us alone. Understand?”\n\nThe chief obediently brought Mr. Clackworthy and The Early Bird from their cells in the jail and conducted them to his private office.\n\n“Beat it, Givney; shut the door behind you,” ordered Chicago Charlie. “Sit down, you two,” he went on as the door slammed; “sit down and talk turkey. You’ve got me hooked, an’ I know it.\n\n“I thought I’d run you out of town; it didn’t work. You two came out here to get me; I understand it now—and you put it over. There’s no use raisin’ a fuss about that part of it. The question is—how much do you want?”\n\nThe Early Bird who, a moment before had been the glummest man in seven States, stared in amazed delight at Mr. Clackworthy; somehow Mr. Clackworthy had put it over.\n\n“I guess you ain’t forgot them ten thousand smackers of mine that you went south with, eh, Chicago Charlie?” James inquired gleefully.\n\nThe banker winced unpleasantly at the name which he had not heard for many years.\n\n“Cut out that stuff,” he ordered. “I’m willin’ to pay a reasonable amount of blackmail to you two —”\n\n“Blackmail!” interrupted Mr. Clackworthy. “I am quite sure that neither James here nor myself have any intention of blackmailing you.”\n\n“Then what do you call it, I’d like to know?”\n\n“Now come—er—Charlie,” and Mr. Clackworthy smiled. “Suppose we put this on a strictly business basis. You are indebted to Mr. Early in the sum of ten thousand dollars, a debt which has been unpaid for more than ten years. The interest on that, straight interest at six per cent, amounts to more than six thousand dollars. Should we compound it, and most certainly it should be compounded, it would reach a very large sum. However, I am sure that he will waive compound interest if you, in turn, would allow him something for the—er—expenses of collection.\n\n“Surely there is no blackmail in a straightforward business proposition of this character. Speaking as Mr. Early’s representative, I offer you a settlement figure of twenty-five thousand dollars. Not a penny less—er—Charlie; take it or leave it, just as you choose.”\n\n“Cut it half in two; twelve thousand five hundred,” parried the banker.\n\n“Not a cent for bargaining,” refused Mr. Clackworthy.\n\n“How’re you goin’ to call off your dogs?” demanded Chicago Charlie. “How are you going to shut up that newspaper? I guess he knows the whole thing, too, eh?”\n\n“Not a word.” denied Mr. Clackworthy. “In fact Mr. Early here has not yet written his series of sensational articles, and Editor Stone rather advertised them blind; that is to say, he accepted a gift of three thousand dollars from me, given under the condition that he accepts my—er—suggestion that he popularize his paper with a touch of —ah—sensationalism. Of course he may guess at a thing or two, but so far he knows absolutely nothing.”\n\n“All right,” brusquely interrupted Chicago Charlie. “I know when I’m licked. I’ve got to cough up. Come on down to the bank just as soon as I have the judge lift the sentences, but you ought to be in the pen—you blackmailers!”\n\nMr. Clackworthy chuckled.\n\n“You know—er—Charlie,” he said, “you brought the whole thing on yourself. You forced us to the one method of—er—collection that we would have never thought of. The Early Bird would never have exposed you—not in a thousand years. He doesn’t play the game that way. But you didn’t know that. You got worried and tried to drive us out of town; if it hadn’t been for that, I would have never known that you were scared to death of a—what The Early Bird would call ‘a squawk.’ I had about given you up as a bad job; if you had let us alone we would have left town to-morrow, and you would be twenty-five thousand to the good.”\n\n“Come on, boss; save th’ chin music until after I’ve got that jack in my mitts,” cut in The Early Bird. “I been waitin’ more’n ten years t’ find out how it’d feel t’ see Chicago Charlie count out my winnin’s on that hundred-t’-one shot. I reckon that’s worth a few hours in jail, eh, boss?”\n\nMr. Clackworthy’s slight shudder seemed to dispute this opinion.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

The servants talked in whispers as they went about their duties. Mistress had kept to her room for two days now, and in the garden the master was in conference with a couple of strangers who had just arrived.\n\nNobody knew for certain what had happened, but the rumour went round that Jimmy, the three-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Graham, had disappeared.\n\n“You’re my last hope, Mr. Hawke,” Dwight Graham was saying to his visitor. “I’ve done my best to hide the truth even from the servants. Jimmy’s gone. He’s been kidnapped!”\n\n“How long ago did this happen, Mr. Graham!”\n\n“Two days ago. I got the message from the gang this morning.”\n\n“You prefer I should handle it instead of Scotland Yard?”\n\n“They threaten to kill the boy if I call in the police!”\n\nMr. and Mrs. Graham were wealthy Americans. Since birth their son had been threatened with kidnapping, and it was because of this they had come to live in England.\n\n“We expected peace here,” Dwight Graham said.\n\n“There were attempts before you left America?” asked Hawke.\n\n“Yes. A gang operating from Detroit tried to snatch the lad. It’s the same crowd, Mr. Hawke. Here’s the note I received.”\n\nHe took a crumpled envelope from his pocket. The envelope bore a London postmark.\n\nHawke opened the letter.\n\n“We have your kid!” it read. “If you want him back, the price is!00,000 dollars. Tell the police, and he dies. Contact us through personal column of the Tribune. Hurry up, for we don’t like this country!”\n\nA lock of fair hair from the boy’s head was clipped to the paper. There could be no doubt that it was genuine.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nAn Inside Job\n\nI’ll take care of this,” the criminologist said, pocketing the envelope and its contents. “Now, will you please show me where the boy was when he disappeared?”\n\nMr. Graham walked down a winding path to a lake at the back of the estate. On the far side were trees which shaded the high wall. He pointed to an open piece of ground which was fitted up as a child’s playground.\n\n“The nurse left him there,” he said.\n\n” She was only gone fifteen minutes.”\n\n“Left him alone?” Hawke’s eyebrows shot up. “Surely—” he began.\n\n“The dog was with the boy. You haven’t seen it yet, but when you do you’ll understand there was no reason why she should not have gone away. Rex is devoted to Jimmy, and would have attacked any stranger who tried to molest him.”\n\n“And the animal was here when she came back!”\n\n“Just wandering about! It didn’t appear to be disturbed.”\n\n“Curious! I’d like to see the dog.”\n\n“There he is, Mr. Hawke.”\n\nAn enormous Airedale bounded down the path to the playground. At the sight of Hawke, its hair bristled. There was a growl as the creature ran forward with the obvious intention of attacking, and Mr. Graham caught it by the collar just in time. He held it back with difficulty.\n\n“As gentle as a lamb with Jimmy,” the millionaire said. “He tolerates Mrs. Graham and myself, and seems to understand that the nurse and some of the other servants have the right to go near the boy. But strangers! Well—”\n\n“He treats them as he treated me!” said the criminologist. “Certainly it is mysterious that the kidnappers could have taken the boy away without causing the dog to bark, at least!”\n\nHawke stopped speaking as a man came down the path after the dog. He was neatly dressed in chauffeur’s uniform, and the Airedale’s tail wagged as he approached. He slipped a leash into the loop of the collar, and patted the dog as it licked his hands.\n\nThe chauffeur apologised for having released it. His voice was pleasant, but he darted quick glances at the criminologist.\n\n“Rex is a bit upset, sir,” he said to his employer. “He misses his little friend. Will Master Jimmy soon be coming back?”\n\n“In a few days, Harris,” Mr. Graham said cheerfully. “You’d better shut the dog up in the stable.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\nHarris went away, with another backward glance at Hawke.\n\n“You have kept the servants ignorant of the truth?” Hawke asked.\n\n“I’ve told them Jimmy’s gone to a nursing-home, but I think they guess what has happened.”\n\n“The dog seems to like Harris.”\n\n“Yes, he seems to have a remarkable control over it. Ah! I understand what you mean, but, although he’s only been with me three months, there can be no doubt about his honesty. He used to be chauffeur to one of my very best friends in the States. Due to financial troubles, my friend had to let most of his servants go. I took this one over and I must say I’ve found him entirely trustworthy.”\n\nHawke nodded. He put several questions, and finally suggested that Mr. Graham should return to the house to comfort his wife. There was nothing to be gained by rehashing the details of the tragedy, and the criminologist was anxious to make a tour of the grounds before deciding what should be done.\n\nAccompanied by his assistant, Tommy Burke, he walked along a path by the side of the lake. It led to the wall surrounding the estate. Hawke stopped and looked at it.\n\n“It would have been easy to hoist the boy over that wall,” he mused. “I’m certain of one thing, Tommy— this is an inside job!”\n\n“Graham is sure of his servants, chief.”\n\n“Too sure. One of them has failed him, so we’ll set a trap and see who we can catch!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nAn Unsuspected Passenger\n\nDixon Hawke took a magnifying glass from his pocket and began a careful examination of the wall at the spot where he believed the kidnapped boy had been passed up to accomplices. He made a great show of his work, and Tommy knelt by his side, busy with a tape measure. Although they appeared to be engrossed, they were alert for anybody who might come along.\n\nFive minutes later Tommy moved closer to his employer.\n\n“Somebody’s watching us!” he whispered. “I saw the bushes move a moment ago!”\n\nHe sat back on his heels and pretended to scribble some measurements in a book.\n\n“Yes,” Hawke said loudly. “They went this way. We’ll make inquiries of the police if any strange cars were seen around.”\n\nOut of the corner of his eye Tommy saw the bushes move again. Somebody was crawling away, and after waiting a few minutes, Hawke and Tommy moved in the same direction. They found another path which led to the stables at the back of the house.\n\nA car was in the yard, and a hosepipe with water spurting from the nozzle lay nearby. As they stood looking at the car the chauffeur Harris came on the scene. He appeared to have been running, and there was dirt on the knees of his whipcord breeches.\n\nPicking up the hose, he continued to wash the car. Hawke turned his back on the man and faced Tommy. His lips framed words which the young fellow was able to read.\n\n“Watch him,” Hawke was saying. “If he leaves the premises, follow him. I’m going up to the house.”\n\nHe then made some remark about seeing Mr. Graham, and went off, with Tommy at his side. Outside the gate leading from the yard Burke doubled back, while his employer continued towards the house, talking loudly, as if his assistant was still with him.\n\nTommy pressed himself flat to the wall and peeped through the gate. Harris had turned off the hose and was drying the car hurriedly. Presently he dropped the cloth and lit a cigarette, puffing at it nervously. Finally he walked into one of the converted stables which were now used as the chauffeur’s office, and Tommy heard him using the telephone which communicated with the house.\n\n“Hullo, Jason,” came the man’s voice. “Look, I’m taking the car out to make some running adjustments. I’ll only be gone half an hour. Will you tell the master if he should ask for me?”\n\nHe reappeared a moment later and entered another door, climbing a flight of steps leading to his private quarters.\n\nTommy hesitated for a second, and then darted across the yard and got into the car. For a two-seater it was extremely roomy, and there was a wide space at the back of the seats where luggage could be carried. He squeezed into the gap and pressed himself flat to the floor.\n\nShortly afterwards Harris jumped into the machine, pulling over his eyes the soft hat he had gone to fetch. He drove out of the main gates to the road, and increased the speed until the car was touching sixty miles an hour.\n\nAt this reckless pace he raced along the winding lanes, and from the fact that the journey seemed to be mainly downhill, Tommy guessed he was making for the Thames valley, which was within easy reach of Highlands. Finally the car bumped over rough ground and came to a halt. Harris got out.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Message Is “Launched”\n\nLifting his head, Tommy risked a peep. They had left the road, and the car was parked in a copse on a hill above the river. Far away on the right were the roofs of the riverside village of Parbram, but the chauffeur turned in the opposite direction and vanished down the slope.\n\nIt was easy to follow him, for bracken and gorse covered the hillside and gave excellent cover. Some distance away a man was sitting on a small stool, canvas and easel before him. He was busy painting the view, and Harris paused when he reached him.\n\nThe artist was a little hunchbacked fellow. A hat with a wide brim covered his head, and Tommy could not easily see Ills face because of it.\n\n“Well? “ muttered the hunchback, as he carefully squeezed paint on to his palette.\n\n“There’s something funny, boss—”\n\n“The police?”\n\n“Worse. A couple of strangers have just arrived at the house, and they’ve been snooping round. I got the name of one of them. He’s Dixon Hawke— whoever that may be!”\n\n“Hawke!” burst out the painter.\n\n“You fool, don’t you know who he is? One of the smartest detectives in this country! Get back to the house and stay there. Don’t try to contact us again! It’s every man for himself now that Hawke’s on the trail. As for the kid—a sack and into the river with him!”\n\nThe hunchback snarled as he snatched the canvas from the easel and flung it on the ground. He packed the rest of his kit and, without another word to his accomplice, walked rapidly away along the bank of the river. Harris turned and ran back up the slope to the place where he had left the car.\n\nTommy had to make a quick decision. Hawke’s plan had worked perfectly and they were now definitely on the trail of the kidnappers, but there were complications which left the young fellow in a serious position.\n\nThe hunchback had said he would get rid of the boy, and Tommy was sure he would carry out the threat. There was no time to report back to Dixon Hawke.\n\nKeeping to what cover he could find. Tommy followed the man and watched him disappear among some trees which shaded a quiet backwater of the Thames. A small houseboat was moored near the bank, and a couple of men were sitting on the deck. When the hunchback arrived, all three went below after pulling in the gangplank.\n\n“That’s where they’ve got the kid!” Tommy muttered. “How the dickens can I get a message through to the chief?”\n\nSuddenly he had an idea, and went back some distance until he reached the main channel of the river. There were no boats about, but he had not expected to be lucky enough to see one, and he searched about until he found a heavy piece of wood. With his knife he cut a hole in it and fitted a stout twig to make a mast. To this he fastened a strip torn from his handkerchief.\n\nTommy worked quickly. He pushed the blade of the knife into the under part of his crude boat to act as a keel. Then he took a page from his notebook and scribbled a message to Hawke, adding the telephone number of Highlands and promising a reward if the finder called Hawke at once. He fastened the paper to the mast.\n\nWading into the water he pushed his clumsy craft out from the bank. He knew the river well, and nodded with satisfaction when the strong current carried the boat away rapidly in the direction of Parbram. It would, he thought, be seen by the keeper of the first locks, which were about two miles away.\n\n“That’s the best I can do,” he muttered. “Now I’ve got to get on board the houseboat and try to save the kid.”\n\nHe slipped out of his clothes and entered the water. The hunchback and his gang would be watching the approach from the shore, and he hoped to climb aboard from the other side.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Scuttled Houseboat\n\nAt the entrance to the backwater Tommy dived and swam under water. He kept his eyes open, and looked up, presently seeing the black shadow of the boat, and rising beneath its bulging side. For a few minutes he rested, getting his breath, and as he clung to the side he listened to voices coming from an open porthole nearby.\n\nThe men wore arguing. One of them declared that it was unnecessary to abandon their scheme because of Hawke, but the hunchback interrupted fiercely:\n\n“You’re a fool! This Hawke isn’t like the cops at home. I tell you, the kid must be dumped.”\n\n“I don’t like killing kids!”\n\n“You’ll do what I say, Spike— unless you want to go in the river with him. Go and get him!”\n\nTommy waited for nothing else and, gripping the mooring-chain, he hauled himself up to the deck. There was just time to dodge behind the angle of the raised portion of the main cabin before Spike came up from below.\n\nAfter glancing around, the kidnapper went forward and unlocked the padlock of a small hatch in the bow. He stretched himself flat and reached down.\n\n“Come up, brat!” he growled. Tommy was unarmed, but he slipped a heavy brass pin from the rail and weighed it in his hand. On tiptoe he crept up behind the man.\n\nSome instinct warned Spike of the danger. He rolled sideways and flashed his hand to his pocket, but before he could draw the gun Tommy struck him on the head. There was enough force behind the blow to knock the man senseless, but just before the impact he let out a shout.\n\nBurke snatched the man’s gun and dropped feet first down the open hatch. He slammed the cover down after him, and found bolts on the underside which he quickly slipped into place. Just as he did so, he heard men running along the deck.\n\nHis hands touched a pile of dirty blankets, and something moved under them. A muffled whimper reached his ears, and he felt around until he found a small boy whose hands and feet were cruelly tied. Strips of adhesive tape were over the youngster’s lips to stop his cries.\n\nTommy rolled the boy to the far side of the narrow locker and crouched above him, looking up at the hatch. An excited conversation was going on above.\n\n“They’re after us, boss! The guy who did that to Spike must have gone ashore to get the police!”\n\n“Get the brat out!” commanded the leader of the kidnappers.\n\nSomebody pulled at the hatch and then jumped back with a gasp of alarm.\n\n“Locked on the other side! He’s down there!”\n\nSuddenly there was the muffled report of a revolver fitted with a silencer. A bullet tore through the hatch-cover and missed Tommy by a few inches. He lifted the gun he had taken from Spike and fired in return. Somebody swore on deck, and there was a hasty retreat from the hatch.\n\n“No chance of getting him out, boss! He’s got Spike’s gun!”\n\n“Then we’ll drown him like a rat! Whoever it is, he knows enough to land us in jail! Go and take the plugs out of the bilge, and then get the launch ready. We must move!”\n\nThere was silence for a short time, and then a faint gurgling reached Tommy’s ears. Water was pouring into the bilges and would soon flood the craft. Minutes passed, and the boat lurched heavily to one side. Tommy got up and slipped the catches of the hatch. He had already freed the boy of the ropes and adhesive tape, and he put an arm around him and spoke quietly.\n\n“Look, kid. I’m going up, and I want you to follow. Jump into the water—understand? Try and paddle yourself to the shore, and when you get there, run!”\n\nThe youngster nodded understanding, and Tommy prepared to make a dash for the deck, hoping that his shooting would drive the kidnappers to cover and give Jimmy a chance to get over the side. It was, he knew, a slender hope.\n\nAs he placed his hand on the hatch there was the sound of a speeding launch. A moment later guns began to bang on deck, and the shrill voice of the hunchback rang out in a scream of rage.\n\n“The police! They’re all around us! Get the gun!”\n\nThe boat was now rolling slowly as the water poured in. Tommy threw back the hatch and hauled himself up. He saw the hunchback crouched behind a weapon of the light machine- gun type. The man was just pressing the trigger when Hawke’s assistant fired at him.\n\nAnd then the houseboat rolled over, and Tommy just had time to snatch Jimmy from the locker and dive into the water. A launch crowded with police sailed up. Dixon Hawke, who was also aboard, reached down and took the boy from his assistant.\n\n“Good work!” he said. “You did a fine job, Tommy!”\n\n“So my message arrived, chief!”\n\n“Yes, it was picked up by the lock-keeper below Parbram!”\n\n\n\nThe hunchback gangster and his companions were taken in charge by the police, who had already arrested Harris. The latter confessed, that he had been bribed to play his part in the kidnapping before leaving America. It had been his job to make friends with the dog so that it would be possible to walk off with Jimmy without causing any commotion.\n\n“And that was the weak point in their plans,” Hawke said later. “The silence of the dog when Jimmy disappeared was obviously curious, and it made me certain from the beginning that it was an inside job. I set a trap, and Harris fell into it.”\n\nHe looked at Tommy Burke.\n\n“But all the credit should go to my assistant. If it had not been for his quick-witted action, there would have been a terrible tragedy!”\n\n~THE END~\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Francois Eugene Vidocq\n  A Full-Fledged Police Officer\n  Vidocq’s First Arrest\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nFrancois Eugene Vidocq\n\nParis has many claims to distinction. Not the least is the fact that in that city a contrite crook organized the first detective bureau in the world.\n\nSet up in 1817, the original Brigade de Sûreté was unlike any law-enforcement enforcement body before or since. Each of its 28 social agents was an ex-criminal who was required to wear gloves so he would not accused of picking pockets while on duty.\n\nThe commander of the Brigade had served time in nearly every important prison in France. He had engineering no less than 21 jail breaks, and at the time he experienced a change of heart was known as one of the cleverest felons in Europe.\n\nFrancois Eugene Vidocq always claimed that his first major conviction was the result of a frame-up. It all started when he deserted from the army and found himself in the strange city of Lille with several months’ pay in his pocket.\n\nThough only 18, he knew his way around. His good looks — plus the gold coins in his pockets — soon won the heart of a black-eyed girl named Francine. But Vidocq had a rival in a captain of engineer. When Vidocq tried to drive off the competition by beating him up, he was arrested and sentenced to 90 days for disorderly conduct.\n\nJailers of the period were permitted to assign private rooms to prisoners who could pay for the privilege. At the Tower of Saint Peter, Vidocq secured the best the place afforded. A trio of less fortunate inmates begged him to permit them the use of his room a few hours a day, and he foolishly consented.\n\nHis new friends wanted privacy in order to forge a release order for one of their number. Vidocq later insisted that he knew nothing of what was going on, but when the plot was uncovered the forgers named him as an accomplice. His protestations of innocence went unheeded. So he decided to escape before sentence could be passed. It was obvious that if brought to trial, things would go against him. Besides, he wanted to see Francine again.\n\nDozens of prisoners had already tried to break out of St. Peter’s. Some had overpowered guards. Others had sawed bars and dug tunnels. But in twenty years, not a man had gained freedom — and four had been killed in attempting a getaway.\n\nVidocq saw that he couldn’t hope to escape by force. He studied the situation and discovered that a military surgeon visited the prison twice each week. Francine came in nearly every day and, bit by bit, smuggled a uniform to Vidocq.\n\nHe practiced the gestures and speech of the doctor until he could imitate them perfectly. Then he put his disguise on and boldly walked past three turnkeys, out the front gate.\n\nA few hours later he was strolling along the principal street when a gendarme recognized him. Vidocq surrendered without struggle, even bought his captor a glass of rum in a nearby saloon. On the way back to prison they chatted like old friends until an empty street was reached. Prepared for just such an opportunity, Vidocq took a handful of ashes from his pocket, threw them in the officers face and took to his heels.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Full-Fledged Police Officer\n\nThere followed a fantastic series of re-captures and escapes. Vidocq could never resist a pretty face, and time after time he was trapped when visiting Francine, or Elisa, or Coco.\n\nEach new arrest was followed by an escape. Once he spent 55 nights digging a tunnel. At Bicetre, he disguised himself as a nun and sauntered out of the prison hospital, pausing at the door to chat with a guard.\n\nAgain, he discovered that a particular dungeon was equipped with locks which could be opened with a master key. He studied the shape of the key, made a model out of a carrot and shaped a mold from bread. Then, using pork fat for fuel, he melted his tin spoon and poured it into the mold. The first casting was a failure, but on the second attempt Vidocq produced a perfect master key.\n\nBetween sessions in jail, he was involved in one crime after another. Hoping to throw off pursuit, he took the name of a sailor whom he knew to be dead. His disguise deceived the father of the youth. But even as August Duval he was not free of trouble — the dead man had been wanted for desertion from the navy. Arrested, “Duval” was placed in custody of an officer who recognized him, so Vidocq resumed his own identity.\n\nThis time he was shipped to Brest, under sentence of eight years in the galleys. En route to the prison ship, Vidocq sawed off his chains and escaped. He determined to go straight, so found a pretty milliner and persuaded her to take him for a partner. But a former jail-mate recognized him and turned him in to the authorities.\n\nAnother escape and a second attempt to lead an honest life met the same ill-luck.\n\nNow the best-known rogue in France, in 1809 Vidocq realized that the only way to make up for the past was to join forces with law and order. He offered to serve as a spy on his former associates, in return for release from La Force Prison and a full pardon. Authorities indignantly refused the proposition.\n\nBut a few weeks later, Paris suffered a wave of spectacular robberies. The gendarmes were completely baffled, and in desperation the police commissioner turned to Vidocq. Without leaving his cell, he gathered information that broke the case.\n\nHis fellow prisoners would have murdered him had they suspected his new connection, so Vidocq staged another escape — this time with the cooperation of his jailers. For months, he acted as a stool pigeon. Eventually, however, the underworld learned that he was in the pay of the police. So he dropped the pretense and became a professional detective — first in the world.\n\nPolice work in the early 19th century consisted of: (1) preventing crimes, (2) catching law-breakers in the act, and (3) exacting confessions from suspects. Anything remotely like modern detective work was completely unknown.\n\nSoon after Vidocq became a full-fledged law-enforcement officer, he was challenged by a particularly brutal murder. A butcher, carrying a considerable sum of money, was knifed in the outskirts of Paris. There were no witnesses, no suspects. In the ordinary course of events, the crime would have been charged to “parties unknown” and the case closed.\n\nBut the former convict had his own ideas as to how an investigation should be conducted. He took impressions of the footprints at the scene of the crime, collected a button, and even picked up several scraps of blood-stained paper.\n\nTwo of the bits seemed to have been torn off to wipe the blade of a knife — the murder weapon. A few letters were scribbled on the fragments, but made no sense. Not a gendarme in France would have wasted a second glance on the crumpled scraps.\n\nVidocq carefully matched the torn edges and deciphered what appeared to be part of an address:\n\n\n  \n    \n      A Monsieur Rao —\n    \n    \n      Marc hand de vins. Bar —\n    \n    \n      Roche —\n    \n    \n      CW —\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nAfter studying a list of the streets of the city, the detective reconstructed most of the address:\n\n\n  \n    \n      A Monsieur Rao —\n    \n    \n      Marchond de vins. Barrier Rochechouari, Chouses de Clignancourt\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nIf his deductions were correct, a wine merchant who lived at the Barriere Rochechouart was connected with the case. Before the end of the day, he discovered in that area a shop operated by a shady character who called himself Raoul.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nVidocq’s First Arrest\n\nInstead of arresting the suspect, Vidocq had the house watched. A well-known highway robber appeared within a few hours, was shadowed to his rooms and arrested. Law did not require that a formal charge be entered, so Vidocq merely hinted to the prisoner. Court, that he was suspected of smuggling.\n\nLeaving Court in jail, the detective called on Raoul. He explained that the wine-merchant had been reported as a dealer in immoral literature.\n\n“Of course I know there’s nothing to it,” he declared affably. “But just as a matter of form. I’ll have to search the place.”\n\nRaoul made no protest, even offered to help the friendly officer. Among the papers in his desk was a letter, from which part of the address had been torn. A glance showed it to be the sheet from which the pieces found at the murder scene had come. Raoul noticed Vidocq’s stare and reached for a pistol. But the detective disarmed him and carried him to the prefecture of police.\n\nEven though convinced that he had the murderers, Vidocq could not hope to get a conviction on circumstantial evidence — such a thing was unheard of in that day. So he told each of his prisoners that the other had turned state’s evidence. Confronted with this information and the torn letter, Raoul confessed. Court admitted that he was guilty and both died under the guillotine.\n\nNot all Vidocq’s cases showed such ingenuity Many of them were routine. Others were clinched by the evidence of paid informers. For a period of two decades, his force of spies and investigators won more than twenty convictions a week. He instituted the police line-up, and devised the first crude file listing data on all felons — the forerunner of the FBI record system.\n\nAside from his colorful personal exploits, Vidocq deserves to be remembered by all true connoisseurs of crime because he was the father of the detective story. In 1829, he published a long account of his own life. All previous literature in the field of crime had glorified the criminal. Vidocq was not at all modest; he made the most of his own feats in the interest of law and order, and was the dashing hero of his own autobiography.\n\nMany noted writers of fiction were influenced by the book, and produced stories in which detectives were the heroes. Victor Hugo, Honore de Balzac, Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan Poe and A. Conan Doyle were among those directly influenced by Vidocq’s story, and the modern detective tale stems from the works of these masters.\n\nSuper-rogue who regretted his crimes to become a trail-blazer in the field of detection, Francois Vidocq has been overshadowed by modern sleuths as well as gangsters. But the movement that he started produced scientific crime detection, and his own life gave the detective his place as a hero in fiction!\n\n~ THE END ~\nBack to Top\n"

Five minutes after he had walked into the living room of the cheap mountain-lake cottage, sleazy and reeking with the odor of stale fried grease, Joe Levering knew he had drawn a complete dud.\n\nOne Jake Grunderpest, a Detroit hackie, had fought off three stick-up men to save the jewelry of his passenger. And said passenger had turned out to save the newest Hollywood glamour-puss being spotlighted for stardom. Levering’s sheet had discovered Jake had an ever-loving spouse living less than fifty miles from the home city. So it had been a hot jolting ride in one of the paper’s broken-down coupes up to this Godforsaken neck of the woods for a human interest story. What did Mrs. Grunderpest think of her Jake now, Mrs. Grunderpest thought the same as ever.\n\n“That no-good louse! Something smells there. He wouldn’t have the nerve to slap down a starved cockroach was it stealing the food off his table! Aside from that he’s too lazy to. That louse!”\n\n“But the actress gave him a thousand dollar reward,” Levering reminded her wearily, trying to blow up tome kind of copy out of it. “A thousand dollars, Mrs. Grunderpest!”\n\nShe rocked, unimpressed, her thick hips threatening to split the skintight bright green slacks with every backward motion of the creaky chair.\n\n“So, a thousand! That bum, he won’t have it ten days! I know him. Any time he had two bills to rub together, he went on a bat. That bum!”\n\nLevering closed his notebook with a snap. Maybe he had been a damned fool to try to become a newspaper man. There had been a lot of legwork when he had been on investigator for that private eye, and sometimes you got your skull dented up; but there had been some excitement.\n\nThe woman ceased rocking to crane her fat neck and peer out the end window of the room. Her eyes had flicked that way repeatedly to the cottage some fifty feet down the lake front.\n\n“New people moved in there. ‘Bout two weeks ago. A redhead and a man. But he ain’t her husband; you can’t tell me that. Every night he goes out to the garage to sleep. Something fishy there. She don’t want to be neighborly either. Don’t talk to no one. Something fishy.”\n\nMrs. Grunderpest lifted her glass of tepid beer.\n\nLevering wasn’t interested in the local gossip. He made a dying attempt. There must be some angle.\n\n“Why did Jake leave home, Mrs. Grunderpest? Incompatibility or perhaps — “\n\n“Incompatibility my eye! And he didn’t leave. I threw him out, the bum.”\n\nHer attention swivelled to the place down the lake front again.\n\n“She ain’t a real redhead either, that one down there. From my upstairs porch I can see through the trees into her bedroom window. I seen her dyeing it.”\n\nShe touched her own brassy-blonde tinted-up hair. “She has a man come to visit her sometimes at night too.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nLochinvar — A Crazy Name For A Dog\n\nLevering lunged at that opening. He had to bring back something to that slave-driver on the city desk.\n\n“Suppose Jake used that thousand smackers, Mrs. Grunderpest, to pay you a visit? Suppose he walked in this door asking for forgiveness and — “\n\nMrs. Grunderpest’s horselike jaw shot out.\n\n“I’d smack him down with the heaviest thing handy, then kick him down the front steps,” she came back promptly. “That bum! … It’s a real swell that comes to see her though. Flashy dresser with big rings an’ all. I think it’s a love nest over there.”\n\nShe inclined her head toward the other house the front of which projected from the intervening woods just enough to be in sight.\n\n“But her gentleman friend sure has a swell jallopy.”\n\n“Hope I can get mine up that hill,” Levering said as he moved out onto the porch with its rusting screens. He eyed the rocky sharp incline up from the lake of the narrow rutted private road that came down midway between the two camps.\n\n“The gentleman friend, he don’t bring his all the way down here,” rambled on Mrs. Grunderpest. “Leaves it up there where you turn off from the main road. But I was out for a walk one night and I saw it. What a classy job! Whew! All creamy white leather inside. It reminded you of a bed.”\n\nMrs. Grunderpest cocked one eyebrow archly. “He’d left his hat in it. That was white too.”\n\n“How nice,” chirped Levering, starting his rangy frame gingerly down the rotting steps. “Well, Mrs. Grunderpest, I’m sorry to have bothered you.”\n\n“No bother, at all, mister. Things get pretty dull down here. If them folks next door there was a bit friendlier why — oh, there’s their dog!”\n\nShe pointed down the line. A goldenbrown spaniel had come to the edge of the other porch, attracted by their voices.\n\n“Lochinvar! Now ain’t that a crazy name for a little dog like that?”\n\nLevering came around so fast his heel skidded on the greasy-damp wood of the step. He had to clutch at the open screen door.\n\n“Wh-what? Mrs. Grunderpest, throw that one in again, slowly, please.”\n\n“Why I just said the dog’s name was Lochinvar. I — “\n\n“Lochinvar … Holy sweet Pete!” breathed Levering.\n\nLochinvar, Giggles Brownell’s dog. Giggles Brownell, the harum-scarum night club showgirl who’d run off with Norry Frone, husband of the Tirndel heiresses, a couple of weeks ago to provide one of the town’s juiciest scandals. And the “gentleman friend” with the white hat and car with white leather interior … .That would be Whitey Grannick, big-time gambler and gambling king of the city. Grannick who believed white was lucky for him and always had plenty of it around him or on him. Grannick who bad been briefly married to Giggles Brownell a year ago, then separated. His brain tabbed off the items summed them up like an adding machine.\n\nIt was a little over a year ago that Whitey had cleaned up a hundred grand at the track one afternoon on a nag named Lochinvar. He had made Giggles a gift of the prize spaniel which had been named in honor of the horse. That clinched it beyond any doubt. Levering tried to keep bis face composed as he realized he hod tripped over a real story. He had found the love-nest hideout of Giggles Brownell and Norry Frone … .\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Pretty Little Plaything\n\nAs he moved toward the other place, Lochinvar came galloping floppey-pawed-over to greet him. Levering rubbed his neck. Nothing to fear there; They were a friendly breed, those spaniels. He buttoned the rumpled double-breasted suit around his large frame, handcombed unruly black hair, and took the steps. It was a bungalow, flimsy, with flecking paint, a shabby hole for the usually bespangled Giggles Brownell. The sound of his knock seemed to rattle around inside the place. When he tried the knob, the door opened.\n\nA living room ran across the front of the place. Cheap furniture. Worn grass-style rug. He sang out and got just that hollow emptiness. He poked his head into the same kitchen, then tried the two doors giving off the rear of the main room. Both were bedrooms, scantily furnished. In the corner one, a woman’s toilet articles and a mass of beauty preparations made a hodge-podge mass on the dressing table. A diaphanous black negligee flung over a chair. He returned to the living room, tapping the side of his nose.\n\nThe spaniel wanted to play. It kept cutting in circles, almost upsetting the rickety little stand that held the telephone. He walked around, firing up a cigarette. There was something damned strange about the picture. Then, just as he was passing the birch-topped table in the center of the room, a tiny shaft of light speared up against his eyeball. He looked down and caught the refraction from an upturned vanity mirror in a partially opened drawer of the table. When he edged the drawer wider, he went rigid the way a man would coming on a coiled snake in the grist. Beside the mirror was an ugly blue-black Police Positive.\n\n“Pretty little plaything — “\n\nHe hooked it out by the trigger guard and went over and dropped down on the divan at the end of the room. The cannon didn’t fit into the picture either. He whistled off key. The spaniel looked at him as if he were a bum sport and went into the kitchen.\n\nThere was another foul note, Whitey dropping around the way Mrs. Grunderpest said. Sure, Whitey had smiled suavely and shrugged his flesh-padded shoulders when Giggles hit the trail with Frone. But along the Main Stem, Whitey was known as a bod character to take a runout powder on. There was that time Easy Al Kass had been found m a vacant lot with a lot of lead in him. The cops couldn’t pin it on Whitey Grannick, but the boys in the know had whispered that Kass had welched and … .\n\nOutside brakes squealed like a patient having a tooth yanked. Levering whipped around in time to see Giggles Brownell poke a shapely calf from a little sedan and then come bouncing over the half-bald lawn. Her usual blue-blonde hair was dyed\nred all right. But he’d seen the pert laughing-eyed face with the lush promising mouth and high-bosomed torso around the night spots too many times to be fooled. Without thinking about it, he pushed the gun between the end cushion and the divan arm.\n\n“Hello.” She stood in the doorway, buoyant, smiling, not at all taken aback to find him there. “You’re a newspaper man.”\n\nHe realized then she had seen the name on his car just up the road. He said, “Yeah,” and “I found the door open so — “\n\n“I’m Mrs. Carson. I can’t imagine what you’d want to see me about. We’re just down here on our honeymoon and — “\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nWhere’s Norry Frone?\n\nIt WAS Levering’s turn to cut her off.\n\n“Cut it, Giggles. I saw your act too many times at the Sphinx Club. You couldn’t fool me if you put on burnt cork and came out in a bedsheet. Where’s Frone?”\n\nHer smile was knocked kicking as if somebody had suddenly pulled a corpse in by the hair. “Frone?” she got out, the name coming awkwardly from lips twisted as they fought for control. “I’m Mrs. Carson, I said — “\n\n“Cut it, Giggles! Mr. Wise Guy knows the lay.”\n\nLevering’s eyes ran around to the kitchen door where the voice came from. Two hundred and twenty pounds of Dummy Carno leaned out of it, beefy hunk of flap-chinned face thrust Levering’s way. Down by the right leg of his pin-stripe blue suit dangled the automatic he held. A silencer extended from the nose of it. Levering recognized him. The Dummy was Whitey Grannick’s bodyguard. The guy with the one-track mind, they said. And only Whitey could put that mind on its track. But when Whitey did, nothing this side of Hell could side track or derail it.\n\n“What do you want here, snoop?” The Dummy said in that stupidity-thickened emotion-lacking voice, advancing into the room. He walked stiffly, heavily, with no motion of the shoulders. And yet, soundlessly.\n\nLevering was doing some swift thinking. They, she and The Dummy, had come in the car together. Seen his Press car. The Dummy had dropped off and soft-footed it in the back way. But it was peculiar that The Dummy, Whitey Grannick’s bodyguard, should be here, living right with — Then he remembered what Mrs. Grunderpest said about the guy who slept in the garage. That would be The Dummy.\n\nLevering shrugged easily and answered him. You didn’t keep a guy like The Dummy waiting too long. He got suspicious.\n\n“Just working on a tip Giggles and the boy-friend were out here. So I looked in. Where’s Norry Frone?”\n\nThe Dummy waved Giggles silent when she started to speak. He was about ten feet away and his eyes like wet stewed prunes hung on Levering as if they were on a desert and nobody else within miles.\n\n“Tip, huh? Yeah? — Well, Frone ain’t around right now.”\n\n“All right — Well, if you haven’t got any statement to make. Giggles, I’ll be rolling along.” He made a quarter turn, put out one foot.\n\nAnd The Dummy had shifted over to block him with a crab-walking movement. “Seems to me I seen you somewheres before — Seems like I remember you as a private eye. Yeah — Maybe you ain’t going no-wheres.”\n\n“I’m a reporter,” Levering said evenly. “Keep me here and The Globe will have the police beating a path in here so fast you’ll — “\n\nIt was the worst thing he could have said.\n\nSomething that might have been fear sparked once in The Dummy’s dark wet globs of eyes. Then he snapped the automatic up, and then down in a chopping motion across Levering’s head. It wasn’t enough to knock him cold; it wasn’t meant to. He rocked backward and jack-knifed down onto the divan. Through the swirling mists he saw The Dummy step back and put the gun on the table, heard vaguely words coming from The Dummy’s voice about maybe a good working over would teach the punk to forget anything he’d found out.\n\nLevering wasn’t taking it lying down. He came off the divan and tried to make spongy knees behave and throw a punch. The Dummy let him have a handful of knuckles below the belt, down close to the groin. The Dummy’s left hook to the jaw deadened some of the nausea. Levering reeled sideward and caught at a chair. He managed to hit The Dummy with his free hand once. Carno spat onto the grass rug and kicked the supporting chair away from Levering.\n\n“Don’t, Dummy!” Giggles yelled hoarsely.\n\n“Shut up,” Carno said and let big Levering have a roundhouse right over the ear.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Frozen Horror Smearing the Showgirl’s Face\n\nThe reporter was lifted half across the end of the divan and flopped down on it, tasting the salt of blood in his mouth. A bell was ringing like mad inside his skull. He felt so loosened up that if he tried to stand he might come apart like a broken piece of machinery. But he had it then. They were afraid of something. That was why Carno was making him into raw meat, the chopped variety. The puzzle pieces all flowed together very suddenly in a neat perfect pattern.\n\nThe Dummy was the bird Mrs. Grunderpest took for the husband. There was no other. And Whitey Grannick slipped in, leaving his identifying white hat and car back up the line lest he be recognized. Why? Because there was no Norry Frone here. And Frone wasn’t here because he was dead! That was it. Whitey Grannick who always settled with any guy who tried to take anything from him. Frone had. Whitey had settled.\n\nLevering pulled his face in a nasty smile.\n\n“So Norry Frone is dead, eh … Whitey fixed him, eh — “\n\nIt was beautiful to watch. That expression of frozen horror smearing the showgirl’s face. The gulp The Dummy took and then the placating breath-sucking smile he sort of pushed up his face, almost manually. The slow “Is-the-bird-nuts?” shaking motion of his head. Friendliness and sweat bubbled out all over him.\n\n“Gees, what give you that idea, chum? — Say, I lost my head. I didn’t mean to smack you around like that. I — “\n\nLevering got himself sitting up.\n\n“You’re lying in your teeth, Dummy.”\n\nHe made his second mistake. He put his left hand into his pocket for cigarets.\n\nIt was as swift as something flashed across a screen. Carno grabbed the automatic off the table and shot Levering through the upper loft arm, believing he had been going for a heater. The slug went right through the flesh and the back of the divan and thunked into the wall. There was numbness as Levering felt himself pinned against the back of the couch, then fierce stinging pain. And being shot made him remembered the gun tucked down beside the cushion. The silencer had stifled the report to a thin sneezing sound.\n\nGiggles was calling Carno a stupid fool, a blunderer. And The Dummy had dropped the automatic back on the table and stood wiping his hands up and down on his thighs as if he wash them clean of the act. Levering sunk teeth in his lower lip and sat up and worked his right hand down. Then he had the Police Positive up and looking them right in the face … .\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA Nice Juicy Murder\n\n“You don’t understand,” Giggles half sobbed again as Levering, stooped so he could get the receiver to his ear with the wounded left arm, waited for his call to the city to go through. He moved the gun muzzle back and forth negatively as if to tell her not to waste her breath.\n\nHe got through to the city desk and got Hopfer on the wire. He said he was out at Little Echo Lake. Hopfer cut in to tell him to forget Old Lady Grunderpest. They had learned the story out in Detroit was a staged job by some ham press agent. Levering tried to keep his voice calm as he did the interrupting.\n\n“I got something bigger, Hopfer. A nice juicy murder! I’ve found Giggles Brownell out here. With Whitey Grannick’s bodyguard, Carno. Got that? They bumped Norry Frone, the guy the was running off with and — What’s that?”\n\nHopfer snapped.\n\n“Lay off those reefers, Levering. The Missing Persons Bureau here just got word from the State Troopers. They found Frone on the Miles City road. He’d just been released by his kidnappers.”\n\n“Kidnappers?”\n\n“You heard me. We just finished checking with old Colonel Tirndel his father-in-law. The colonel admitted he’d had some ransom notes. Didn’t pay any attention and didn’t notify the authorities because they were in Frone’s handwriting and he thought it was a fake. Says he didn’t want that no-good so-and-so of a son-in-law back anyway.”\n\nLevering sagged against the wall and let out a whoosh sound. Hopfer told him he’d better come in, if he was sober enough. Levering hung up weakly, dropping the gun down against his leg.\n\n“They found Frone.”\n\nHe gave them the rest of it in a weary thinned-out voice.\n\nGiggles jumped up and down, clapping her hands together like a schoolgirl.\n\n“That’s what I wanted to tell you. See? The night Norry and I were to run away together, he disappeared. We didn’t know what had happened to him. Whitey said he owed money to some of the gambling crowd and might have been bumped off. See?”\n\n“Like hell I do,” Levering said.\n\n“Well, if he had, everybody — the police — they’d have thought Whitey had done it over me. So Whitey put me out here, hidden, so it would look as if I had gone away with Norry. Now do you see? So it would look as if nothing had happened to Norry! Now it’s all right, now he’s found. And I can go back to town to Whitey. We’re going back together again.”\n\nShe rolled her eyes.\n\n“I found out I still love him … .There’s your story, Mr. Reporter!”\n\nLevering said “Uh huh” and propelled himself to the door. The Dummy just stood in sort of a fateful weary posture, looking stupidly at the toes of his shoes. Levering dropped the gun on the steps and went up the line and climbed painfully into the coupe.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nThe Dummy Was Closing For The Kill\n\nThe little road shot up sharply, over a hump, then screwed around in a big loop to the right to get around that long ledge of rock. It bowed back sharply, running parallel to the now unseen lake, to cut behind the little ridge. With one arm it was hard making those turns. He was just inching along and stalled once going up the next sharp rise. When he got going again there was a bumpety-bump sound that meant a flat. He got out and saw it was the right rear and cursed helplessly for a full minute. It was then the puffing Mrs. Grunderpest, holding her wrapped-up apron in one hand, came stumbling up around the curve. She called to him.\n\n“Mr. Levering, you’ve got to — to go back to that house right away,” she heaved, so excited she didn’t even notice the blood on his left coat sleeves. “Something awful’s happened back there, I just know.”\n\nShe had just been walking by, she said, and happened to look in a window. The Dummy had a gun in the girl’s back and was walking her into the kitchen and to the doorway to the cellar stairs.\n\n“They went down — “ She gulped.\n\n“He came up — alone. Then he ran out the back door and up the other side of this hill.”\n\nShe pointed up at the ridge.\n\n“You’ve just gotta come back and see what — “\n\nHer beady eyes speared over his shoulder. Then she let out a strangled little squeak, dropped the thing in her apron, and ran back down the road.\n\nLevering, squeezing his bullet-ripped arm against the pain, turned to look up the road past the front of the car. Sidling along against the heavy foliage, half seen, came Carno, The Dummy. In a flash, Levering got it. The Dummy had cut through the woods over the ridge, intending to get him as he crept out toward the main road. A quick jump from the trees onto the running board, the gun against the side of his head — Levering choked on a breath that wouldn’t come out. Only the flat tire had saved him.\n\nThen he came alive and threw himself behind the car. A split second afterward that first bullet, followed by the sneezing cough of the gun, slapped off the side of the body. Levering’s foot struck something. A rock, anything to defend himself with. He ducked for it and saw what Mrs. Grunderpest had dropped, a sweet snub-snouted automatic. He had it in his hand as the next shot whanged at an angle across the top of the right rear fender. And some instinct sent Levering down and wriggling under the gas tank, bellying under the car itself.\n\nShuffling steps sounded softly on the earth. Believing him unarmed, The Dummy was closing for the kill. Then, peering under the righthand running board, Levering saw his feet moving past the forward wheel. Waited the length of a full breath and then fired. Carao’s howl pierced the crash of the gun explosion as his left ankle was shattered. Hie feet vanished as he went pitching backward. Levering wriggled head and shoulders out from under the running board, saw him sitting back in the undergrowth, still holding his gun. So Levering shot him very neatly through the right shoulder … .\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nA One-Tracked Mind\n\nOnce again he was back in the bungalow living room waiting for his call to the city to be put through. Only this time Giggles Brownell was not there. Mrs. Grunderpest had guessed right. Levering had been down cellar. Giggles was down there with an ugly bullet hole in the back of her brain.\n\nAnd now Mrs. Grunderpest was the female in the living room as she held the automatic very steadily on the slumped heap in the chair that was The Dummy. The Dummy had two welts rising on his face. It was where Levering had stroked him with that automatic barrel to loosen up his tongue.\n\n“Whitey told me I was to bump her the moment we found out our boys had set Frone free,” was his stupid explanation when he loosened.\n\n“Them was his orders. What could I do?”\n\nThe Dummy of the one-track mind.\n\nThere was a raucous squawk and buzz from the other end of the wire but still no connection. Levering found himself staring at that automatic of Mrs. Grunderpest’s with a perplexed frown. She read his thoughts and edged closer to whisper.\n\n“Mr. Levering, don’t say nothing to anybody about me giving you this gun, please,” she begged. “It was Jake’s. He used to run a still up here and had it around … . That’s why he had to go to Detroit. He beat up three county cops who came snooping around. With his bare hands. Put two of ‘em in the hospital. My Jake’s got an awful temper. Gentle as a cat around the house though. So, Mr. Levering — “\n\nHopfer’s voice scratched in from the city desk at the other end, squawking about the reversed charges. Levering barked back.\n\n“Listen closely, Hopfer, and get your best rewrite man warmed up. This time it is murder — because I got a corpse and a killer on my hands. Giggles Brownell is dead out here … . Shot by Dummy Carno on Whitey Grannick’s orders. How do I know? Carno told me so. That makes Grannick an accessory before the fact. It was his way of getting Norry Frone for stealing his girl.\n\n“What? Don’t you see, sap? Grannick had Frone kidnapped. Sure. Then they made him write the ransom notes so he never would have any evidence he was being held by any one anywhere. See it now? Then they’d find the woman he’d run off with here, dead. And he would never be able to prove where he’d been. Whitey Grannick was going to hang Giggles’ body right around Frone’s neck. You never steal anything from Whitey —\n\n“What? Sure, they probably got some of Frone’s clothing planted around the joint here. Why haven’t I looked? Hells bells, Hopfer, I don’t feel so good. Dummy Carno was throwing spitballs at me … .”\n\n“That’s not news!” yapped Hopfer.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

That night Millrun Tigers were to meet Rondale Swifts to decide once and for all which was superior in the ice-hockey league.\n\nNeither team had suffered a defeat for months, but for a single reason the Millrun boys were fancied to win. That reason was Big Bill Jansen.\n\nJansen, a wizard on skates, had, by the sheer force of his own ability, dragged Millrun from a low position in the league to the happy elevation they now occupied.\n\nDixon Hawke and his assistant, Tommy Burke, ice-hockey fans both, surveyed the scene from their position near the players’ entrance.\n\nThen the teams were taking the ice, while their partisans yelled hoarse encouragement. A special cheer was reserved for Bill Jansen as he glided slowly towards his position.\n\nHawke watched the big man, and was struck by the realisation that Jansen looked ill. Most of the skater’s normal poise seemed to have deserted him. There was, too, a lack of sparkle in the man’s eyes, and his face was pale and drawn.\n\nHawke’s further speculation was halted by the shrill of the whistle.\n\nThe opening minutes saw a tearaway display. The game raged from end to end, and it was obvious that there was little between the teams.\n\nJansen had not been in the picture so far, and his fans were silent, puzzled by his listlessness.\n\nThe Millrun goal had escaped narrowly once or twice when the big skater awoke from the lethargy which seemed to have descended upon him. In a loose scrimmage he collected the puck and tore down the rink towards the opposing goal.\n\nOne of the Rondale men came out to tackle him. Although Jansen had plenty of time to swerve, he went blindly on. The other man made a desperate effort to side-step Jansen’s rush, but he was a fraction of a second late.\n\nThe two players crashed headlong to the ice, slithering for yards. The Rondale man scrambled to his feet, but Jansen lay strangely still.\n\nPlayers clustered round the prone figure. They tried to raise Jansen, and his head slumped forward. The referee’s inspection of the man was brief. He immediately signalled to the ambulance men who were on duty.\n\nSomething in Jansen’s ghastly pallor affected Hawke as he watched the huge form being carried off. With a murmured phrase to Tommy, the detective rose and made his way to the dressing-room.\n\nThe little knot of people standing silent outside the dressing-room parted to let him enter. As the door closed behind Hawke, the grey-haired man, who had been bending over Jansen’s still form, wheeled. He recognised the famous criminologist immediately.\n\n“A terrible business, Mr. Hawke,” he said gravely.\n\n“Is he badly hurt, Doctor?”\n\n“He’s dead.”\n\n“But I’ve often seen Jansen take harder knocks without any ill effects.”\n\n“I know,” agreed the doctor. “But it wasn’t the fall that killed Jansen. He has been poisoned!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Bookie’s Letter\n\nAfter the doctor had gone to call the police, Hawke made a careful examination of Jansen’s body. To his expert eye, all the symptoms of poisoning were there.\n\nContinuing the examination, Hawke discovered three tiny pin pricks in the dead man’s arm. Just then the door swung open to admit the doctor. He was accompanied by a burly, red-faced inspector of police, who grinned recognition at Hawke.\n\nInspector Aldley went briskly to work, and fired questions at the doctor.\n\n“How long would this poison take to kill a man?” he demanded.\n\n“It’s hard to say immediately,” replied the doctor, “but I would think it would take an hour at least.”\n\n“Right,” snapped the inspector. “Now I’ll have a look through Jansen’s belongings.”\n\nA minute later Aldley turned excitedly to Hawke.\n\n“Take a look at this,” he cried. “I found it in Jansen’s pocket.”\n\nHe handed over a piece of paper, and the detective read it out.\n\n“*Dear Jansen,—It would be greatly to my benefit if Millrun lose their game with Rondale. You are the one man who can make your team win.\n\nIf they lose, you will find it well worth your while. Otherwise, it may be unpleasant for you.—Joseph Danton.*”\n\n“Well?” asked Hawke.\n\nThe inspector smiled triumphantly.\n\n“First Jansen gets a threatening letter from Joe Danton. Then he is murdered! I’m going to have a few words with Danton.”\n\n“That won’t be difficult,” said Hawke. “I saw him in the Stadium watching the game: he’s probably still here. But I don’t think he’s your man. He may be a crooked bookmaker and gambler, but he would not commit murder.”\n\nThe inspector ordered the constable at the door to bring in Joe Danton.\n\nA few minutes later the door opened to admit a little fat man in a bowler hat. He looked very uneasy.\n\n“Jansen is dead,” opened Inspector Aldley bluntly.\n\nThe little man raised a nervous, plump hand to remove the cigar from his lips.\n\n“My God!” he gulped.\n\n“He’s been murdered,” went on the inspector, pressing home his advantage.\n\nDanton went dead white, but said nothing.\n\n“What do you know about it?” barked the inspector.\n\n“Me!” The little man licked his Ups. “I know nothing about it.”\n\nAldley held out the letter.\n\n“And I suppose you know nothing about that either?” he queried.\n\nDanton made a hopeless gesture.\n\n“All right,” he said at last. “I wrote that letter to Jansen, because I was gambling a packet on the match to-night. Then I saw him at the coffee-stall ten minutes before the game started. He told me he wasn’t going to deal with me.”\n\n“So you poisoned him?”\n\n“No,” protested Danton. “Why should I do that?”\n\n“So that his team wouldn’t have a chance of winning,” snapped Aldley.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nJansen’s Stepbrother\n\nHawke now took a hand in the questioning.\n\n“You say you saw Jansen ten minutes before the game started?”\n\n“That’s right,” mumbled Danton.\n\n“And when did you see him last?”\n\n“Weeks ago,” said the little man. “I’ve been up north at the races for a fortnight. I came straight from the station to the Stadium to-night.”\n\n“That’s all,” said Hawke, and left the room, to rejoin his assistant in the Stadium and acquaint him with the details of the case.\n\n“Where are we going now?” queried Tommy as they left the Stadium.\n\n“To Jansen’s rooms,” replied Hawke. Fifteen minutes later they arrived in the quiet street where Jansen lived. Hawke pressed the doorbell.\n\nSeveral minutes elapsed before the door was opened. A young man stood in the doorway eyeing the pair with cold, unfriendly eyes.\n\n“What do you want?” he demanded. Hawke forced a civility into his voice which he was far from feeling.\n\n“Were are investigating Mr. Jansen’s death,” he said, “and we would like to examine his rooms.”\n\nThe young man’s expression changed.\n\n“Come in,” he invited. “I am Bill’s stepbrother. It has been a terrible shock to me, as you will understand.”\n\n“Quite,” agreed Hawke.\n\n“Of course,” went on the other, “Bill lived a dangerous life, and these accidents will occur.”\n\n“Yes, Mr.—”\n\n“Margent—Edward Margent is my name,” supplied the other.\n\n“Well, Mr. Margent,” went on Hawke, “I am sorry to inform you that your stepbrother’s death was not an accident. He was murdered.”\n\n“Murdered!” exclaimed Margent in shocked surprise. “But Bill hadn’t an enemy in the world—”\n\nHis voice trailed away, and for seconds there was silence in the room. Then Margent spoke again.\n\n“I bet it was that fellow Danton who did this. Bill had a letter from him asking him to let his team down.”\n\n“We know about the letter,” said Hawke.\n\n“Then Danton ought to be arrested!” said the young man heatedly.\n\n“You can rest assured that the murderer will not escape,” promised Hawke. “Now, do you mind if we have a look round the rooms?”\n\n“Not at all,” agreed Margent, and crossed the room to fling open a door.\n\n“This is—was Bill’s sitting-room,” he explained.\n\nHawke’s glance swept a very untidy room. A bureau against the wall was open, and a litter of papers lay upon it.\n\n“I know the place looks as though it had been burgled,” said Margent, “but Bill was always untidy.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Scrap of Paper\n\nHawke rummaged through the papers on the desk. Then he turned and addressed Margent.\n\nI would like you to show my assistant the other rooms.”\n\nMargent agreed quite readily, and left the room with Tommy.\n\nAs soon as he was alone Hawke fished out a scrap of paper which he had seen wedged in one of the bureau’s pigeon-holes. He flattened out the paper, and found that it bore a few words written in ink:\n\n“You can rest assured that the treatment will have a fine effect. It will only require a few injections—”\n\nThe paper had been carelessly torn here, and there was no signature.\n\nHawke hurriedly pocketed the piece of paper as the door was reopened.\n\n“Found anything important!” queried Margent from the threshold.\n\n“No, I’m afraid there’s nothing here,” said Hawke. “We will have to move off now. By the way, Mr. Margent, do you live here?”\n\n“No,” said Margent, “I came here immediately after I heard of the tragedy, in case I was required.”\n\n“I see,” said Hawke. “Now, could you let us have your address in case we require to get in touch with you?”\n\n“Certainly,” agreed Margent. He produced a fountain-pen and scrawled an address on a piece of paper.\n\nHawke and Tommy took their departure. When they had walked out of sight of the house, Hawke halted.\n\n“I want you to go back and keep an eye on Margent,” he said. “I’ve a feeling that he knows more about this business than he has told us.”\n\nHawke went on alone, and following a brief visit to the railway station, where he made a few inquiries, returned to the Millrun Stadium. The dressing-room in which he had left Inspector Aldley and his suspect was empty.\n\nThe detective went along the corridor and knocked on the door marked, “Manager.” He was immediately admitted, to find the inspector seated there with the manager of the place.\n\n“Where is Danton?” asked Hawke.\n\n“He’s behind bars,” replied Aldley with some satisfaction. “You couldn’t expect me to turn him loose with the evidence we have against him.”\n\n“I suppose not.” Hawke’s agreement was not hearty. He added : “I would like to speak to you alone, if you don’t mind.”\n\nThe manager nodded agreement, and left the room.\n\nWhen the door closed, Hawke turned to the inspector.\n\n“I think,” he said gravely, “that you are making a mistake in arresting Danton for the murder.”\n\n“Oil! And what makes you think so?” Aldley’s tone was cool.\n\n“Simply that Danton could not have administered the poison. The doctor said that the stuff would take at least an hour to have effect, yet Danton did not arrive in town until half an hour before Jansen’s death.”\n\n“Are you sure of that?”\n\n“Yes,” went on Hawke. “I’ve been to the railway station, and a ticket-collector there, who knows Danton well by sight, confirmed the time of his arrival.”\n\n“But,” objected the inspector doggedly, “if Danton didn’t do it himself, he hired someone else to do it. He’s in this business up to the neck, and I’m going to hold him.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Moneylender\n\nOn his return to Dover Street, Hawke seated himself at his desk. Then he drew from his pocket the piece of paper on which Margent had written his address and the other scrap which he had found in Jansen’s bureau.\n\nHe was still studying the handwriting through a powerful magnifying lens when the door swung open to admit his assistant.\n\n“Any luck I” queried Hawke.\n\n“Some,” admitted Tommy rather wearily, as he lowered himself into a chair. “I followed Margent when he came out of Jansen’s house. He went to his own rooms then, and I had a few words with his landlady.”\n\n“Is Margent a doctor?” broke in Hawke.\n\n“No, guv’nor, he’s a student of chemistry.”\n\n“Right, Tommy. Go on.”\n\n“Margent spent half an hour in his room,” resumed Tommy, “and when he came out I followed him.”\n\n“Yes?” prompted the detective.\n\n“He went to a cafe in the East End, and I managed to get a table quite near him, although he couldn’t see me. Then Margent was joined by another man. Just guess who it was, guv’nor.”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Radlow—the moneylender,” said Tommy. “They seemed to be having a quarrel about something. Radlow said : ‘I’ve waited too long as it is, and I think it’s about high time you came through with it.’”\n\n“Margent told the moneylender that it wouldn’t be long until he paid—in full. He said he was expecting some money from an insurance company.”\n\n“Was that all, Tommy?”\n\n“Yes. I followed Margent back to his rooms, and he seems to be there for the night.”\n\n“Good work, son,” commended Hawke, as he thoughtfully handled the pieces of paper ho had been studying. “Take a look at these,” he added.\n\nTommy pored over the handwriting for a few seconds.\n\n“It looks like the same handwriting on both, guv’nor.”\n\n“It is the same handwriting,” assured Hawke. “Margent wrote both.”\n\nThen he asked: “Do you remember the state of Jansen’s room when we went there?”\n\n“Yes,” agreed Tommy. “Margent said he was very untidy.”\n\n“And yet,” went on the detective, “Jansen’s locker at the Millrun Stadium was easily the tidiest one there. Strange, isn’t it?”\n\n“You mean—”\n\n“I mean that someone had been searching Jansen’s belongings—and that someone was Margent. And I think that this is what he was searching for.”\n\nHawke tapped the scrap of paper he had found in Jansen’s bureau. Then he pointed to the sentence which ran: “You can rest assured that the treatment will have a fine effect.”\n\n“I wonder,” concluded the detective, “just what kind of ‘ treatment ‘ Margent was proposing to use on his stepbrother?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nThe Fatal Injection\n\nHawke spent some considerable time the next day studying a book on poisons from his well-stocked library, and later surprised Tommy Burke by enquiring:\n\n“Do you think you could impersonate our moneylending friend, Radlow, on the telephone?”\n\n“I could try,” agreed Tommy readily.\n\n“Right,” said Hawke. “Call Margent and ask him to meet you at the cafe you mentioned last night, at seven o’clock.”\n\nTommy dialled the required number and soon heard Margent’s voice.\n\n“This is Radlow speaking.” Tommy emulated the hoarse accents of the moneylender as he relayed the message.\n\n“All right?” queried Hawke, as the youth hung up.\n\nTommy nodded affirmatively, and then Hawke took over the phone to put a call through to Inspector Aldley.\n\nAt a few minutes to seven Hawke and Tommy were discreetly watching outside the block of flats where Margent had a bed-sitting-room. They had not long to wait before the man came out and swung down the street.\n\n“Wait for me here,” said Hawke to his assistant, and made for the door from which Margent had emerged.\n\nThe detective climbed two flights of stairs and pressed a bell-push. The door was opened by a middle-aged and plump woman.\n\n“Does Mr. Margent live here?” queried Hawke.\n\n“Yes, sir, ‘e does, but ‘e ‘as just gone out.”\n\n“It’s all right,” responded Hawke. “I’ll wait for him in his room.”\n\nThe woman flung a searching glance at Hawke and seemed satisfied.\n\n“This way, sir,” she said, leading the way indoors.\n\nAs soon as the door closed behind the woman, Hawke began a quick study of Margent’s room. He noticed two suitcases in a corner, and bent to examine them.\n\nOne of the cases was locked, and it was on this one that he concentrated his attention. A minute sufficed to spring the lock; then the detective began to search the contents.\n\nHe withdrew his hand holding a little oblong box, and gave a grunt of satisfaction when he opened it. Inside were a hypodermic syringe and a test-tube containing a few drops of clear liquid.\n\nSuddenly Hawke tensed as he heard the patter of swift footsteps outside. He pocketed the syringe and whirled as the door swung open and Margent was framed in the entrance.\n\n“So you thought you had fooled me with your fake phone call,” said Margent in a rapid, tense voice. “It was unfortunate for you that I had just phoned Radlow when your call came.”\n\nHawke fixed a steady gaze on the other man.\n\n“Margent,” he retorted evenly, “you are going to hang for the murder of Bill Jansen.”\n\nMargent permitted himself a brief smile.\n\n“You can never prove that I poisoned him.”\n\nThe detective produced the syringe.\n\n“This is what you used to give Jansen that injection of snake venom.”\n\n“So you’ve found that, too, have you?” Margent dived a hand into his coat pocket and produced a revolver.\n\n“Yes,” he admitted, waving the weapon unsteadily at Hawke, “I killed him. I needed money badly, but when I asked my precious stepbrother for it he refused.\n\n“He told me that all the money I would get from him would be the insurance money after his death. So I decided to collect that, and I saw my chance when he told me about that threatening letter from Danton. He said he was going to show it to the manager, and I thought if the poison was discovered, Danton would be suspected.\n\n“The rest was easy. Bill hadn’t been feeling very well previous to the big match, and I offered to give him an injection to tone him up. He agreed readily enough, because I have some medical knowledge. What he didn’t know was that the injection consisted of snake venom I had been using for an experiment.”\n\nMargent broke off suddenly.\n\n“That’s my confession,” he said, “but you’re not going to arrest me.” His hand tightened on the gun-butt until his knuckles gleamed white.\n\n“Stick them up!”\n\nThe command came from behind Margent. Instinctively he turned, and at that moment Hawke flung himself forward. He crashed into Margent, and they both sprawled to the floor. The gun clattered out of Margent’s hand as his head hit the side of a chair. Hawke rose calmly to his feet.\n\n“Smart work, Tommy,” he said. “Especially since you hadn’t a gun!”\n\nMargent was recovering consciousness when Inspector Aldley appeared.\n\n“What the devil did you ask me to come here for?” he demanded. “And why the battle?”\n\nHawke waved the gun he had picked up in the direction of Margent.\n\n“I want you to arrest that man for the murder of Jansen,” he said steadily.\n\n“But—” began the inspector.\n\nHawke handed over to him the syringe and the test-tube.\n\n“Have these analysed,” he added, “and you will find they contain snake venom—the same stuff which killed Jansen.”\n\nInspector Aldley seemed to be convinced at that.\n\n“Joe Danton will be your friend for life, Mr. Hawke,” he prophesied as he slipped the handcuffs on Margent.\n\n“I don’t think so,” said Hawke grimly. “Not when I’ve told him what I think of dirty little bookmakers who try to bribe or threaten players to lose a game! “\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n\nSay, who are you anyhow? What are you talking to me about? Newspaper men? Well, what do you want with me?\n\nLook here, where am I anyhow? Rescue me? I don’t want to be rescued; just want to lie here and sleep. But I — I feel sick and shaky. I must have been on a howling spree, eh? Only I don’t feel quite like that; more as though I’d been asleep for a long time — a — long — long — time — with dreams. Oh, merciful Father, the dreams! But, of course, they were just dreams, weren’t they?\n\nYes, that looks like the real thing; Scotch, isn’t it? I haven&#39;t tasted any of the staff of life for a dog’s age. Ha, ha, ha! I said that just like a white man, didn’t I? Gee, but that tastes right! What&#39;s that? I am a white man? Course, I am, but I’ve lived so long in Chinatown, drinking that stuff of theirs — hot and fiery sweet, y’know, with a sort of ugly perfume about it.\n\nOld Wu Lang used to say he’d make a good Chinaman out of me yet. That was when I first started coming — just for the “black smoke,” you know. No house in the quarter had the stuff like Wu Lang — the old devil ….g Wu Lang — Wu Lang … What is it makes me shake like this whenever I think of him?\n\nSay, you fellows, you won’t laugh at me, will you? But it just shows what nightmares are — I’d almost swear — only, of course, I know it’s a dream — that I’d choke Wu Lang to death in the middle of the night, with the joss sticks all burning, and — What?\n\nWell, don’t look like that. Say, you chaps look like reg — regular a-asses ….g Now, what’s the matter with my tongue? I never stuttered before in my life. I feel so cold … What are you saying? No … No … Don’t tell me I did it after all!\n\nGive me something to drink again. Maybe I can remember about it … . But I’ll have to think awfully fast. Something is happening to my brain.\n\nWho’s that?\n\nThere, looking straight at me, that old man with the horrible face.\n\nA mirror? Nonsense!\n\nThat isn’t I — with white hair … You’re just fooling with me, you fellows — just because I’m a little sick and shaky. I know what you newspaper boys are. You see, I keep thinking I killed him …\n\nAll nonsense, of course! How could I kill Wu Lang — clever old tramp like him? He is a match for three men like me … See here, you fellows; on the quiet now — don’t give me away — what have you done with her?\n\nNo woman in the house? What!\n\n“The Red Butterfly” wouldn’t go out of the “House of Lost Keys.” Even if the old chap is dead, she’d hang around and burn joss sticks. Great stickler for her religion, the Red Butterfly — and as tricky as they make ‘em.\n\nSay, I was certainly smitten; I sure was. Queer little silent thing, with gorgeous clothes, and always disappearing just when you wanted her most. I’ve always been strong for The Red Butterfly … .\n\nSay, what’s the matter with me anyway? Have I got the jimjams again? I don’t seem to be able to see straight — or think — straight.\n\nThe dreams are coming back … .\n\nI saw her first when I just dropped in for a smoke with Wu Lang. I’d gotten into the way, you know. Beastly bad habit, the black smoke, but there’s no indulgence that can touch it. All the sensations in a pipeful — yes?\n\nShe wore a red coat thing with purple dragons on it, and gold and green combs in her hair. She never smiled, but she was adorable. Wu Lang ate out of her hand, the old sinner. Could do anything she pleased with him … .\n\nOf course, I was keen for her. So’d you have been … Any of you seen her yet?\n\nSay, I believe you’re lying. I thought I saw her red coat go by the door just now … What’s funny? … I thought I saw it again — just now … Only this time some one was carrying her, and she didn’t move … .\n\nDreaming again, I suppose. There’s that about the black smoke — you do dream!\n\nShe never admitted she liked me much. Always said I’d taken advantage of her, tricked her — such rot!\n\nI guess she lied. Anyway, women do, even Chinese women, and it was all nonsense her firing faithful to that yellow old monster, Wu Lang. She said he was her master — had bought her — some truck like that. A custom of her people, I think she said. And if she wasn’t faithful to him she’d burn in torment forever after. Well, of course, no white man would stand for that sort of nonsense. •\n\nAfterward she swore that I’d damned her soul, and she’d tell Wu Lang, and he’d kill us both, and she’d be glad of it. Course I never thought she’d do it, but — but —\n\nYou needn’t draw away from me like that! I’m not a leper; I’m just — a little queer. Wh — What’s the matter with the lot of you, anyhow?\n\nI guess it was a — a joke, wasn’t it? Eh?\n\nSay, there was a writer chap wrote a story about another fellow who smoked the black smoke, and used to watch two dragons on the wall. When they started fighting he knew he was well doped. I saw things too, but — don’t laugh — they were butterflies, red butterflies that crawled up and down the wall. Crawled, remember; for they looked as though they’d been — smashed! Ugh! Beastly thing to dream about, eh?\n\nBe quiet. Place sounds empty, somehow … or is it my fancy? So Wu Lang’s dead! See here, you fellows; hold onto me a minute, will you? Why — why — say, my head’s clearing in a funny way. Why, I don’t seem —\n\nI killed him. I remember perfectly now. Yes, I killed him. I put my hands around his beastly throat — makes me sort of sick to think of his throat, it was so yellow and scraggy — and squeezed and squeezed until he stopped squirming. He died hard, old Wu Lang.\n\nI’d never have had the strength to do it if I hadn’t been driven mad by the torture. Of course, I remember it all now. That’s why I can’t move my hands straight — they go off sideways when I put them out, and they don’t touch things right. Queer’ isn’t it? Old Lang used to light joss sticks under ‘em. You ought to have heard me yell! It seems awfully far off now, and, of course, I haven’t had any pain for years and years … . You chaps look so funny!\n\nHe tortured The Red Butterfly too. That was awful bad. I wouldn’t have believed I’d mind so much. I suppose white men don’t like to see a woman cooked alive, as a general thing. But slip used to scream — and say that I’d hurt her soul worse .than Wu Lang was hurting her body — screaming, you know, all the time.\n\nI half killed myself time and again trying to get at Wu Lang, but he had me tied up too tight. Made a good job of his knots, he did, and grinned all the time. They say Chinamen aren’t given to smiling. He used to chuckle — chuckle like a demon. I can hear his chuckling now — chuckling — chuckling — a little dry, chokey noise ….g Or is it the fire? I never could be sure after a while, which was the flames sputtering and which Wu Lang laughing at us.\n\nThe girl gave out pretty soon; she was weak, or else Lang killed her quickly on purpose. Maybe he got tired of the game. Anyhow — one day she stopped screaming and didn’t begin again …\n\nAfter that he could give all his time to me. I don’t think he did much else except smoke the black smoke and torture me … In between he gave me lots of dope to send me to sleep and keep me alive … It went on for years and years and — where was I? Everything’s getting woozy again … Funny thing! A minute ago I seemed to remember so clearly … .\n\nSay, you chaps, what have I been saying? I want a drink … You look beastly sick and white about the gills. What’s wrong?\n\nWhat’s — ?\n\nI killed him. That’s to my credit anyhow. I killed him with my bare hands, and, when he was pretty well gone, he just grinned up at me with his yellow lips back from his teeth like a dog, and snarled:\n\n“You may have kill’ me, you white devil, but Chinaman have revenge on you.”\n\nHa, ha! Funny, wasn’t it? … Who are those men at the door — the ones in blue? … What are they doing here?\n\nWu Lang, Wu Lang! Chuck these men out of the house, the house of lost keys. Wu Lang!\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Bad Driving Conditions\n  A Jealous Husband\n  Foul Play\n  The General’s Secretary\n  A Slip of the Tongue\n  A Lover’s Vengeance\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nBad Driving Conditions\n\nDixon Hawke and Tommy Burke, his young assistant, were motoring north to pay a brief visit to friends living near Inverness on the shores of the Moray Firth.\n\nThey had been delayed by one thing and another during the day, and darkness had caught them while they were crossing the sombre wastes of the Black Moor.\n\nDriving conditions were bad, for a thin coating of snow over a layer of ice made the road exceedingly treacherous. Neither of them was greatly surprised when the Bentley refused to answer the wheel at a sharp comer, slithered sickeningly for a moment from side to side, bumped once on the grass verge, and came to rest with its two near-side wheels in the ditch.\n\nHawke and Tommy got out and made a quick examination with torches. The position was not as bad as it had seemed at first. By jacking up the car gradually and filling the ditch with large, fiat stones from a dyke that ran across the moor nearby, it would be possible to get the car back on to the road again.\n\nThey set to work without delay, for the night was bitterly cold. But, in spite of their hard work, it was a couple of hours before they were ready to start again, and Hawke decided that it was too late to continue their journey to their destination that night.\n\n“There’s an inn I’ve stayed at once or twice, not far from here,” he said. “It’s an old coaching-place. And it’s clean and the food’s good. So we’ll put up there and carry on in the morning.”\n\nTen minutes later they saw the lights of the inn down in a hollow below them, and when they got down to it the moon showed for a few minutes between the storm clouds overhead, and Tommy saw that it was a three-storeyed, whitewashed building, with small windows set in even rows, and crow-stepped gables.\n\nApparently the car had been heard, for a big, grey-bearded man in plus-fours came out of the front door.\n\n“Good-evening, Mr. MacDonald,” said Hawke. “You remember me!”\n\nThe other peered at him in the darkness for a moment.\n\n“Yes, yes, of course I do,” he said. “It’s yourself, Mr. Hawke! Come away inside and I’ll have your luggage brought in for you. And what brings you north at this time of the year?”\n\nAs they entered the hall — a low-raftered place, warm and comfortable in the yellow light of paraffin lamps — Hawke explained that the Bentley had gone off the road, and that the delay had decided them to stop there for the night.\n\nHe had scarcely finished speaking when a voice barked from the shadows near the fireplace, where a log fire was burning:\n\n“What’s that? Bentley car? Gone off the road, hey? Serves you damn well right, sir. Following me all over the countryside.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Jealous Husband\n\nA Jealous Husband.\n\nA MAN with a very red face and a white, bristling moustache strode across the hall and stopped in front of Hawke, with his feet planted wide apart. He was heavily built and fleshy, and he spoke in a barrack-square voice.\n\n“Serves you damn well right, sir. That’s what I say. Sneaking all over the country at my heels. Good mind to write to the papers about it. I’ve a good idea what your game is, sir.”\n\nHe swung round suddenly.\n\n“Emmy!” he bawled. “Emmy! Bedtime! Emmy! Where’s that ass of a woman got to now, hey?”\n\nAs he stamped across the hall and through a curtained doorway into another part of the inn, they could still hear his faint shout of “Emmy! Emmy!”\n\n“I think he’s looking for someone,” said Hawke gravely.\n\nMacDonald chuckled.\n\n“It’s his wife, poor lady! The General’s a man with a hot temper, and he aye thinks there’s somebody running after his wife. And the one man that really has a fancy for his wife is right under his nose, and he doesna ken it. Come away into my sitting room, Mr. Hawke, and get warmed at the fire. I’ll have a meal for ye in ten minutes.”\n\n“And who is this man who has a fancy for the lady?” Hawke asked as the sitting-room door closed behind them.\n\n“The General’s secretary  — young Mitchell. A nice lad, and more of an age with the lady than the General is. What he wants with a secretary is more than I ken. He’s been retired this past ten years, and all he does is write to the papers, exposing this and exposing that, and wanting to abolish this and abolish that.”\n\nTen minutes later Hawke and Tommy sat down to a meal in the dining room. In the opposite corner two hikers were finishing supper. They were rough looking customers; they watched Hawke and Tommy in silence, and after a few moments they rose and went out.\n\nThe General’s voice was heard in the hall, shouting for Emmy. Then a woman spoke, and the General answered her.\n\n“Well, I’ve been looking for you all over the place. It’s bedtime. Come and have your hot milk.”\n\nThe General came into the dining room, scowled at Hawke and Tommy, and sat down at a table by the fire. He was followed by a pale woman of about thirty. A young man was with her, and Hawke surmised that this was Mitchell, the secretary.\n\nThe three of them sat in silence throughout the meal. Several times Hawke saw the woman and the young man glance at each other. There was no mistaking that glance, yet the General was too preoccupied with his newspaper to notice it.\n\n“There’s going to be a blow-up there, guv’nor,” whispered Tommy.\n\n“I think you’re right, my lad,” answered Hawke. “It has the makings of a nasty situation. And now let’s turn in. We’ll try to get away pretty early in the morning.”\n\nMacDonald himself showed them up to their rooms. A warm fire and a paraffin lamp were burning in each of them. Hawke did not undress at once. He stretched himself out in an easy-chair and prepared to smoke a final pipe.\n\nA few minutes later he heard a car draw up in front of the inn. He went to the window and peered out between the curtains into the darkness. He could see the car down below, with dark figures moving backwards and forwards in the light of the lamps.\n\nHe heard MacDonald welcoming the newcomers. Then he saw — in a flash of light from a torch — that the car was a Bentley. He let the curtains slide back into place and went thoughtfully back to his chair.\n\nHe was interested in the General, with his curious fear that someone was running after his wife.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nFoul Play\n\nHawke sat musing until a slight sound outside his door roused him.\n\nHe went swiftly over to the door and opened softly. By the dim, reflected light of the lamp inside the room he saw a dark figure moving down the passage. He recognised the back of one of the hikers, and he fancied that the man was rather unsteady on his feet.\n\nHawke closed the door and went back to his chair.\n\nHe must have fallen into a doze again, for later he was awakened suddenly by a loud crash of breaking glass outside.\n\nHawke rose to his feet and stood listening intently. There was no sound at all for several seconds. Then someone hammered thunderously on the front door.\n\nHawke sprang towards the door. He reached the hall in a matter of seconds, and found MacDonald standing blinking, with a lamp in his hand. Hugh Mitchell was drawing the bolts on the front door, and both of them were fully dressed.\n\n“Did ye hear it, then, Mr. Hawke?” asked MacDonald. “What can it be, I wonder?”\n\nMitchell got the door open at that moment, and in the dim light they saw the flat, peaked hat of a policeman in the opening.\n\n“There’s been an accident out here,” he said urgently. “Gentleman’s fallen out of one of your upstairs windows and through the glass roof of the porch. Give us a hand to get him inside. It’s a good thing I was passing at the time.”\n\n“It is indeed, Sergeant,” said the innkeeper\n\n“Bring the poor man in here,” he added, as Hawke and Mitchell helped the policeman t o raise the limp, pyjama-clad body from the floor of the porch.\n\n“God save us!” whispered MacDonald as the light from his lamp fell on it. “It’s the General! Bring him into the lounge just now.”\n\nHe went ahead and held the door open. When they had laid the General gently on a sofa, Hawke made a quick examination. Then he glanced up.\n\n“Dead,” he said quietly.\n\nHe turned to the body again and examined it more carefully.\n\n“An accident of this kind will no’ do your place any good, MacDonald,” said the policeman at length in a low voice.\n\n“I’m not sure that it was an accident,” murmured Hawke without looking up.\n\n“Suicide, then?” said the sergeant.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Ye don’t mean — Ye don’t mean it was murder?”\n\nHawke straightened himself.\n\n“I rather think so,” he said briskly. “You don’t mind if I carry on just now. Sergeant? I’m Dixon Hawke.”\n\n“I knew that fine, sir. Photographs in the papers, ye ken. That’s all right, sir.”\n\n“Very well, then, I don’t think we’ll waken any of the others just yet. I’d like to have a look at the General’s room first. But you might call my — Wait, though. Here he is.”\n\nTommy had come into the room. An overcoat was thrown over his pyjamas.\n\n“What’s up, guv’nor? I heard a crash. Somebody hurt?”\n\n“The General’s dead, Tommy.”\n\nTommy whistled slowly through his teeth, glanced at Mitchell and said nothing.\n\n“We’ll go up to his room,” said Hawke abruptly. “Sergeant, you’d better come. And you, MacDonald. Mr. Mitchell, you and my assistant will watch the body.”\n\nHawke went over to a writing-table and took a handful of envelopes from a rack. All but one of them he slipped into his jacket-pocket. Then he beckoned to the sergeant, leant over the body, and gently forced open the right hand. Lying in it was a piece of white tape, about three inches long. Hawke had noticed the end of it protruding from the clenched fist.\n\n“That is what makes me think there was foul play,” he said quietly as he slipped the tape into the envelope and handed it to the sergeant. “You’d better take charge of that. And, by the way, if you look at his tongue, you’ll find that the under side of it has been bitten slightly. And now we’ll go upstairs.”\n\nMacDonald, with a lamp, led the way up to the General’s room.\n\nJust inside the doorway Hawke paused and looked round slowly. The bed was disturbed, as though its occupant had left it hurriedly. Otherwise, everything seemed to be normal. The window — a casement — was wide open. Hawke held the lamp down to the floor and gave a sharp exclamation.\n\n“See that, Sergeant?”\n\nClearly showing on the pile carpet were the marks of nailed shoes. The dead man’s shoes, which were laid outside the door, were soled with rubber. Only one or two of the prints were visible. Hawke arranged a chair so that they would not be disturbed, and went into the room.\n\nWhile the other two looked on, the detective made a quick but thorough inspection of the room. He picked up a burned match-end from the reading-table at the side of the bed, put it into an envelope, and gave it to the sergeant.\n\nOn the mantelpiece, in a glass of water, was an upper set of false teeth.\n\n“H’m. That explains why the tongue was bitten on the under side only,” said Hawke.\n\nVery carefully he lifted the false teeth out, slipped them into an envelope, and gave them to the sergeant.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe General’s Secretary\n\nHawke went over to the bed, folded back the clothes and turned over the pillows.\n\n“Ah! That’s what I wanted,” he said suddenly.\n\nOn one of the pillowcases was a speck of blood. Hawke turned it up and examined the end of it.\n\n“Notice anything?” he asked the sergeant.\n\n“Can’t say I do, sir.”\n\n“One of the tabs is missing. It’s been torn off.”\n\n“Ay, you’re right, sir. So it has. One of the ribbons for tying it on. Now, where can it have got to, d’ye think?”\n\n“You have it in an envelope in your pocket,” said Hawke quietly. “And I think that’s about all we’re likely to find.”\n\nHe was interrupted by the noise of the door opening. He swung round and saw a man peering into the room.\n\n“I say,” said the newcomer. “Is anything wrong in here? We heard a noise.”\n\nMacDonald glanced helplessly at Hawke.\n\n“This is Mr. Skinner, sir,” he said. “He arrived with a friend late to-night. Will I tell him — “\n\n“Come in,” said Hawke curtly.\n\nThe man came into the room. He was followed by another younger man. When Skinner came into the light of the lamp Hawke exclaimed:\n\n“Good heavens! It’s you.”\n\nThe other peered at him.\n\n“Dixon Hawke! Well, I’m blessed! You’re the last person I expected to see, Hawke. How are you?”\n\nThe two men shook hands, and Skinner introduced his companion as Allan Byars.\n\n” Mr. Skinner’s an old friend of mine, Sergeant,” Hawke explained. “And a very useful man to have here to-night. He was one of the best men in Scotland Yard before he retired six months ago.”\n\nHe turned to Skinner.\n\n“I’ll tell you what’s happened as we go downstairs, old man. MacDonald, you might waken these two hiker fellows and the General’s wife.”\n\nDownstairs, Hawke, Skinner and the sergeant went into MacDonald’s sitting-room.\n\n“I’ve told you, Sergeant,” said Hawke, “that this is murder. But perhaps you didn’t quite notice why I came to that conclusion. It’s very obvious. The General was smothered in his bed with a pillow. In his struggles he bit his tongue, and you saw the small bloodstain that resulted on the pillow. He also tore off one of the tapes from the pillowcase, and we found it clutched in his hand. He was then pushed out of the window in order to fake suicide or accident. By the way, I don’t think I ever heard his name.”\n\n“Askew,” said Skinner. “I saw it in the hotel book when I was registering.”\n\n“Thanks,” said Hawke. “Well, it’s clearly not an accident, because he’d have let go that tape as he fell. Instinctively he’d have used both hands to catch hold of something. And he’s the very last type in the world to commit suicide.”\n\n“Can you suggest any motive, sir?” asked the sergeant.\n\nHawke shrugged. “There’s one very obvious motive. Mitchell — the secretary — and Mrs. Askew are in love with each other.”\n\n“Then we’d better be having a word with Mr. Mitchell,” suggested the sergeant.\n\nHawke nodded, and the policeman went to the door and called for Mitchell.\n\nThe young man was ill at ease when he came into the room, but Hawke wasted no time.\n\n“You are General Askew’s secretary?”\n\n&#39;’Yes.”\n\n“What did your work entail?”\n\n“Writing letters mostly,” said Mitchell. “The General sometimes wrote a dozen letters to the papers every day. It was a kind of passion with him.”\n\n“I see,” said Hawke, nodding. “What were you doing downstairs tonight?”\n\n“I had a dose of toothache. I came down to get some whisky from the General’s decanter in the sideboard. The — the accident happened just as I got into the hall.”\n\nHawke nodded again.\n\n“I was there myself just a few seconds after the General fell, so that more or less confirms your story. There’s just one thing more. General Askew appeared to me to have been an exceedingly jealous man. Had his wife in the past given him any cause for this?”\n\nMitchell tinned an angry red.\n\n“General Askew never had any cause to doubt her, though he thought so,” he replied curtly.\n\n“Thank you,” said Hawke. “That will be all, I think. If these hiker fellows are down yet, you might send them in.”\n\nMitchell nodded and went out. The sergeant glanced suspiciously at Hawke.\n\n“Do you think he and the lady were in it together, sir?” he asked.\n\n“Impossible!” said Hawke definitely. “It would take two strong people to lift a heavy man like Askew through the window, and Mitchell was certainly downstairs when that was done.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nA Slip of the Tongue\n\nThere was a knock at the door, and the two hikers came sheepishly into the room. Hawke stared at them for a moment, and then said sharply:\n\n“What business had you in General Askew’s room to-night?”\n\n“Me?” said one of them indignantly.\n\n“I wasn’t anywhere near — “\n\nHawke silenced him with a wave of the hand, and glanced at the other.\n\n“Well?” he snapped. “What about you?”\n\nThe man shifted uncomfortably.\n\n“Come along!” said Hawke. “Out with it! One or other of you left his footprints in the General’s room.”\n\n“Well,” said the second man slowly, the General’s room is next to mine. I went in by mistake.”\n\n“What happened?”\n\n“The old man sat up in bed and started to curse me. Then he struck a match and started to light his lamp. But I didn’t wait. I just bolted.”\n\n“Very wise,” said Hawke dryly. “He was a quick-tempered man. I believe you’re telling the truth.”\n\nThe sergeant broke in. “I wouldna let it go at that, sir. Ye see — “\n\nHawke interrupted him gently.\n\n“It fits in quite well, Sergeant. You remember the burnt match that we picked up from the table at the bedside? That was used to relight the lamp. The General smokes cigars, as you may have noticed from the cigar-case that was lying on the dressing table. But there was no sign of his having smoked a cigar after he had gone to bed — no ash or anything.”\n\n“He might have lit it at his bedside, sir,” said the sergeant slowly, “and gone over and smoked it by the window.”\n\nSkinner chuckled.\n\n“On a night as cold as this, Sergeant? Not on your life! If he smoked anywhere, it would be in bed. And you try smoking a cigar with your false teeth on the mantelpiece. It’s not very easy, Sergeant.”\n\nThe sergeant made no reply, and Hawke laughed.\n\n“You’re still pretty sharp, even after six months’ retirement,” he said to Skinner.\n\nThen he rose abruptly, paced once across the room, and stood looking down into the dying embers of the fire with a frown of concentration on his face. At length he turned very slowly and said in a hard voice:\n\n“I know who committed this crime. Sergeant, come with me. I’ll not be five minutes, Skinner. There’s just one point.”\n\nHe went swiftly from the room, and the sergeant followed him through the hall to the lounge, where Tommy was waiting with MacDonald. For several minutes Hawke paced up and down the room without speaking. The others watched him curiously. Suddenly he stopped and turned to face them.\n\n“Where are Askew’s false teeth?” he asked the sergeant.\n\nThe sergeant fumbled in his pocket and produced the envelope that Hawke had given him, with the teeth inside. “Here, sir.”\n\n“Then how did Skinner know that they were on the mantelpiece? They were in that envelope and in your pocket before he came into the room. He must have been in the room before. And in it long enough to notice that the dental plate was on the mantelpiece. An innocent man wouldn’t have kept that dark, Sergeant.”\n\n“You’re right!” said the sergeant in a hoarse whisper. “But you’re not going to tell me that the gentleman from Scotland Yard — “\n\nHe was interrupted by the roar of a high-powered car in the stillness outside. For an instant no one moved.\n\n“And an innocent man wouldn’t try to escape,” Hawke said. “I expected to hear that car.”\n\nAs he spoke he went quickly to the door. A swift glance into MacDonald’s sitting room showed that it was empty. The window was standing open.\n\n“Tommy!” shouted Hawke. “MacDonald! Come with me! Sergeant, you’d better stay here and take charge.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA Lover’s Vengeance\n\nIt took them five minutes to get the Bentley started in the cold night air. But once it was started Hawke wasted no time.\n\nThey could see the lights of the other car far across the moor. Hawke edged the Bentley on a little harder, until even Tommy was moved to say something.\n\n“Watch out, guv’nor!” he shouted. “We’ll be ditched again!”\n\nHawke said nothing. The lines of his face were hard and tense. The car swooped down into a hollow. There was a bend at the foot. The tyres screamed on the ice and began to slide. MacDonald shouted with horror, and the car lurched sickeningly into the ditch, slithered for a few yards, and came to a halt.\n\n“I told you to watch what you were doing, guv’nor!” gasped Tommy breathlessly.\n\n“I knew perfectly well what I was doing,” said Hawke calmly, and he sat back and pulled his pipe from his pocket.\n\nHawke pulled once or twice at his pipe until the tobacco was burning evenly. Then he turned to MacDonald.\n\n“MacDonald,” he said, “I’m going to tell you a story. About three years ago General Askew had a secretary — a girl called Helena Barnes. Her mother was ill, desperately ill, and needed money for a special cure. But they had no money.\n\n“The girl’s brother was struggling through the university. And the girl, as a last resort, stole from the General. He found out. She told him that her brother would pay it back when he was qualified, but it was no use. The General was a hard man. He prosecuted her, and she served eighteen months in prison.\n\n“The detective in charge of the case was a brilliant man from Scotland Yard. Hyde was his name. You know him as Skinner. He felt that justice had gone astray. The law was satisfied, but not justice. When the girl came out he met her. They fell in love, and were going to be married. The newspapers made a great story of it.\n\n“Then General Askew thought it his duty to write to certain public men, pointing out that it was wrong for an ex-jailbird to marry an officer of Scotland Yard. The result? The girl committed suicide, and Hyde was forced to retire.”\n\nHawke paused, and MacDonald said cautiously:\n\n“How do you come to know all this, Mr. Hawke?”\n\n“My work keeps me in touch with Scotland Yard. I knew Hyde, and I got most of the details from him. Unfortunately, it didn’t occur to me that this was the same Askew until Hyde came into the room that time. Then everything fitted together like the parts of a jigsaw puzzle. I knew that Hyde had been following the General all over the country, waiting for an opportunity. The General himself told me this. Only he had drawn a wrong conclusion. He thought that it was someone with whom his wife was having a liaison. He was a man stupidly jealous of a very much younger wife.”\n\nHawke paused again.\n\n“Hyde was never the same after his fiancée’s death,” he went on at length. “He went slightly mad, I think. But he was sane enough to commit what was nearly a perfect murder, with the help of the girl’s brother. And, if I’m not mistaken, he’ll have his plans well laid for just such an emergency as this. The pity is that I didn’t know he was here until after I had point out to the sergeant that it was not an accident. If I’d known he was here, I’d have fitted the jigsaw point in time and held my tongue. As it was, I had to clear the others by denouncing him.”\n\nThere was a brief silence.\n\n“Ach, well,” said MacDonald after a time in a curiously husky voice, “I’ve nae doubt he’ll get away all right — him and the poor lassie’s brother. We might have caught up on them if we’d kept to the road, but the surface being that bad, there’s nobody could blame us for finishing up in the ditch. The sergeant will be sorry to hear about our — accident.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Hawke quietly. “I thought you’d say something like that. And I believe justice has been done. Tommy, there’s some fine big stones in that dyke over there. And a couple of hours’ hard work ahead of us. Jump to it, my lad!”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

Sobbing across the Florida bay like an embodiment of fury, it buffeted Dorothy Janeway’s new gray sedan. She tightened her hands on the plastic steering wheel, feeling the whole car shiver in a wailing blast of wind.\n\nDriving alone, she was prey to a thousand fears — the lonely empty stretch of spray-swept road — the possibility of a flat tire. She realized she was a person who despised loneliness, and being on the highway late at night like this appalled her.\n\nExcept for the two frail holes her headlights bored in the black wet night, she could see nothing clearly. Dimly, she made out the shifting shadows of tall pines heaving and bending beneath the force of the storm.\n\nHer sensuous lower lip crept between her teeth. Perhaps she should have stayed over in Bradenton with Harry and Sue. But she’d laughed at Harry’s fears.\n\n“Of course there are storm warnings. But I’ve plenty of time to get back to St. Pete.”\n\n“No use arguing, Harry,” his wife Sue had sighed. “What Dorothy Janeway intends is always what she does — but do be careful, darling.”\n\nThere was a reason Dorothy Janeway meant to be home exactly on schedule. But she said nothing about this to Harry and Sue. The visit with them had been nice, she was anxious to be home with Robert in the storm — that was all.\n\nHer eyes glued to the slick stretch of highway, she thought of the way Robert had looked the day she’d packed to visit in Bradenton. She had snapped her bag closed, not wanting to look at him again.\n\n“I’m sure this is the best way, Robert,” she had said. “Lord knows I don’t owe this girl anything, least of all my generosity in allowing you to see her again. But these things are better when the break is final and complete, if there’s no room left for willy-nilly hope and indecision in her mind. You’ll have a day or so to think things over, to get in mind just what you’re going to say to her.”\n\nShe had looked at him then. A tall, lean man with a fine-boned face, gray sprinkling his temples, wearing tropical worsteds debonairly. Moody eyed, his face white about the lips. President of her family’s company, Larkin’s Citrus, he had the worldly appearance of an artist.\n\nShe had looked down at her bag. “When I get back from Brandenton, perhaps we can live on the beach for a week and you can do a painting.”\n\nThe indrawn expression of his face hadn’t changed. “You’ve been darned decent about this, Dorothy.”\n\nHe’d stowed her bag in her car, and kissed her goodbye with lips cold against her cheek. She’d tried to smile. She’d been sure it would pass. He would break off permanently with the redheaded Janice Carter. There’d been difficult times before. Robert had always been moody; sometimes in the early years of their marriage, his crazy drinking bouts lasted days at a time while he railed against this house, against Larkin Citrus.\n\nBut he loved the comforts her money bought too well ever to break away. And Dorothy was pleased with the bargain of their married life: Robert cut a good figure as host and husband. Not since their honeymoon had he suggested they live on his meager income while he established himself with his painting. She’d exerted all her charms to get him to enter her father’s firm. He was successful except for a lack of firmness with the employees.\n\nThe storm outside the car was melting into one continuous roar. Dorothy Janeway breathed relievedly when she saw the street lights along Fourth Street were still burning. Soon the light power would go off, leaving the city desolately black, in hurricane-riven oblivion.\n\nWatching skittering dead palm fronds, she wheeled into her driveway from the deserted street. Her rambling Spanish style house stood limned faintly against the black maw of sky.\n\nThrough the iron grillwork enclosing the patio, she could see a single lighted window. She clamped her hand on the horn, waited, blew the horn again in short, angry barks. Nothing happened, the rumbling wind increased.\n\nImpatiently, she slipped into her rain hood. She blew the horn twice more in long, annoyed blasts. Then she opened the car door. The wind struck with such force she had to cling to the door handle. Rain, wind-driven, slashed her cheeks. Lowering her head, she ran to the garage doors. Counterbalanced, they swung up easily.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe House\n\nWhen she had the car safely in the garage beside Robert’s, she made her way through the house to the lighted study. The study was empty. All the rest of the house was dark.\n\n“Robert?”\n\nThe rising thunder of the hurricane made the silence here in the house all the more hateful.\n\n“Robert!”\n\nStanding in the doorway, she reminded herself coldly that a single lamp turned low in a silent house was no reason to get the shakes. But Robert’s coupé was in the garage. He must be in the house.\n\nShe heard a loud metallic crash, realised it was a metal chair hurled by the wind against one of the pillars in the patio. It struck her then that Robert had done nothing to ready the house for the blow. Windows unshuttered, lawn furniture exposed in a battened-down town.\n\nShe went on standing there, staring at the light, the silent deserted study. Annoyed because she knew Robert had furloughed the servants the moment she was out of the house. Now, where was he?\n\nShe crossed to the telephone, picked up the receiver, dialed. There was nothing, no contact, just the immensity of silence.\n\nShe went stiffly through the house, turning on lights as she passed each switch. Out in the gleaming white kitchen, she found the candles she’d bought for candle light dinners. She was glad she had plenty of them. The power would be going off soon.\n\nThe cabinet door stood open. Tensing, she thought if someone beside Robert were in the house — had heard the car horn — hidden …\n\nIt’s nerves, she told herself firmly.\n\nWith the box of candles under her arm, she started back to the living room, glancing at windows and doors as she passed, making sure they were closed and locked. Except for the things outside, she felt the house, unprepared, could weather another hurricane. She paused in the dining room, listening to the wind. It was sending tremors through the house now.\n\nIn the living room, she put the box of candles on an end table and sank in a deep club chair. There was nothing more she could do now but wait, listening to the rain against the windows. The lights flickered, dimmed, and she stiffened involuntarily. There were hours of utter darkness ahead. But she didn’t want candlelight yet. She hoped feverently the lights would not go out until Robert returned.\n\nFrom her chair, she could not avoid seeing a portrait Robert had done of her, on the opposite wall. He could really paint, she admitted reluctantly, but somehow she’d never liked this particular painting.\n\nNow she found herself staring at it. The lights dimmed again, the face in the painting seemed to come to life, the shadows about the cheekbones deepening, the eyes leaping at her, almost glowing.\n\nShe caught her breath. Rising, she moved slowly toward the painting. The hurricane pounded against the walls of the house.\n\nWhy, she’d never really seen this painting before. Those lean cheeks, the tilted, stubborn chin, the contempt in the violet eyes, the hauteur stamped in the shadowed planes of forehead, cheeks and jaw.\n\nShe thought, but I’m not like that at all. How monstrous of Robert to do such a thing.\n\nChilled, she sank in the club chair again, pushing herself far back in it. Remembering the painting was done just after her father died. She’d been almost prostrated by grief. Robert had stunned her after her father’s death by being almost gay. He had even suggested they sell the house.\n\n“Of all things!” she’d said. “And, I suppose, the Firm?”\n\nAnd the Firm. Go away together. All she could think was, father built a success here, and Robert mustn’t be allowed to throw it away on a whim such as painting.\n\nShe tore her gaze from the portrait, her hands splayed on the arms of the club chair. She listened to the awful whisper of the hurricane; shadows lengthened in her gaze, and nameless dark phantasms bubbled in her mind. Her father’s grave swept by the fury of the storm, the way he’d always said she was his daughter, now he in his loneliness, she in hers … .\n\nHer lips trembled. She turned her head again to stare at that horrid painting. She brought her eyes back to the study doorway. Her heart lurched. She was positive she’d left the study door standing open. Now it was closed.\n\nShe crouched in the chair, unable to move. A draft of air of course, swinging the door gently closed.\n\nShe stood up. After a moment, she went to the study door. There with hand on the knob, she listened, hearing only the throb of the storm. She flung the door open.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Smoldering Darkness\n\nIt was as if clammy hands laid themselves upon her, tight on her throat. A draft of air might close a door. But it couldn’t do this. She remembered distinctly she’d left the study light burning. Yet now the study was illumined only by the glow spilling wanly from the living room.\n\nShe braced herself against the doorjamb. She saw nothing in the study from the living room glow to alarm her. She would walk to the study lamp, unscrew the bulb, certain she’d find it burned out.\n\nWith an effort, she took a step. She was three steps inside the study when the whole house plunged in blackness.\n\nShe smothered the scream. She clenched her hands tight at her sides, feeling the agony of the pulse hammering at her temples.\n\nIn the smothering darkness, she made her way to the end table where she’d laid the candles. She clasped one up, reaching in her pocket for her cigarette lighter. Flame wavered on the candle wick and sent out bleak wan shadows in the living room. She sighed. It was so nice to have light again.\n\nShe hadn’t thought of holders and the end table was one of her favorites. But she began lighting candles from the first one, dropping wax to hold them upright, and lining them up on the table. She created a tiny world of light, determined she would spend the night in the club chair, the guttering candles beside her.\n\nShe huddled in the chair, feeling cold, with the darkness pressing in damply upon her. There was a lull in the wind, bringing a momentary silence that made her feel as if her brains were being sucked out through her ears. In this silence, she heard the gentle closing of a door … .\n\nBracing her arched back in the club chair, she stared at the study doorway. It was still open. But beyond it — the closet door?\n\nNew thrusts of wind and rain enveloped the house with a crash that deafened her. The candles flickered, feeble and impotent. Her eyes caught the first movement in the study, a shifting of shadow against shadows.\n\nShe inched her way out of the chair. Realized she was silhouetted starkly against the candlelight. Trembling, she could feel beads of clamminess in her palms as she struck out in a spasm of movement of her leaden arms and pushed over the end table. The candles winked out.\n\nShe knew he’d been waiting for the power to fail. Involuntarily, she stepped backward. Then she was stumbling through the suffocating blackness. She knew her beloved house so well, yet for a moment she completely lost her direction.\n\nBlindly, she located the dining room buffet. Her shaking hands sought a drawer. When the drawer was open, her fingers froze and she endured the desperate thought she was going to faint. Beneath her groping fingers, the rest of the set was there, but long, keen carving knife was gone.\n\nBreath sobbing out of her in soft moans, she made her way along the dinning room wall.\n\nShe saw the faint wink of light in there almost like a firefly, as the wan ray of a pencil flashlight touched here and there, seeking her. Coming closer to her. Until it touched her.\n\nShe screamed, reeling away from the wall. She clawed her way through a jungle of furniture, down a corridor of night, babbling wildly to herself.\n\nShe’d escaped the little light. She was in the kitchen. She remembered the door that opened on the side lawn.\n\nShe opened the door. The wind roared in, sending something crashing behind her, needling rain through the screen in a fine, cold spray.\n\nOutside, the wind tore the breath from her, leaving her lungs burning. Gripping her, it hurled her bodily along the side of the house. Stumbling, she landed in a huddle in the wet grass, pushed herself to her knees.\n\nRain streamed down her face, her hair was wet and harsh against her neck and cheeks. Sodden and numbed, she searched for the shadow of the house next door. Just a small expanse of lawn to cross. Then safety, with other people around her.\n\nShe moaned as a shadow slashed at her, missed and struck the side of the house, a wet palm frond, torn by the wind.\n\nReeling to her feet, huddled against the house, she shivered as the wind plastered her wet clothes tight against her.\n\nShe saw the wan pencil flashlight again. It too, moved alongside the house, nearing her, winking low to the earth.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nRobert!\n\nDorothy Janeway knew she could never reach the house next door.\n\nI’ll get back inside, she thought, lock all the doors. Lock myself in a room.\n\nShe grabbed at the slippery spider-working of thin wrought iron bars that enclosed the patio. Clutching at them, she moved forward until she reached the gate. Opening it, she stumbled into the patio.\n\nShe found it calmer here, sheltered on three sides by wings of the house. She ran to the portico, rattled the doorknob of the small storage room that opened off the kitchen. It was unyielding, and she remembered she’d checked every window and outside door when she’d first discovered she was alone.\n\nTerror had blanked her mind. Trapped her here in the cul-de-sac formed by the house … .\n\nOn the wall beside her a yellow spot splashed. She twisted, and the light caught her in the eyes. There was no time to move, not even time to shrink. He dropped the light and sprang upon her, his knife glinting. Even in the raging storm she could hear his breathing. She could feel his hands, clutching at her throat.\n\n“Robert!”\n\nHe was smashing her back. She was falling into depths as black and turbulent as the hurricane itself. She thought: There are two hurricanes. One in Nature. One in Robert.\n\nHer head struck something hard. Lights pinwheeled behind her eyes for an instant before they vanished. Dorothy Janeway ceased to hear the hurricane … .\n\nDorothy felt the warmth of crisp white sheets against her body, sunlight against her face, a cap swathing her head down to her ears, which must be bandages. She smelled, faintly, biting antiseptics, knew she was in a hospital.\n\nThere was a soft scuffling of feet, sound of voices. There was someone named Conlan from the police who wanted to question her. A doctor warning that he was rushing things. Then Conlan again, saying they only wanted to know if Mrs. Janeway had some idea where her husband might have gone.\n\nAnd then Sue’s voice, and warmly Dorothy realized Sue had ridden up from Bradenton to be with her.\n\n“You’re sure it was — Robert?”\n\nThe man Conlan answered Sue, his voice low. As she listened, her eyes closed, the torrents of rain swept again through her mind, and the hurricane raged anew in Dorothy Jane way’s brain.\n\nJanice Carter was dead. Robert had found her body on the beach before her cottage.\n\nThe two had had a last quarrel. According to Janice Carter’s maid, the redhaired commercial artist had railed at Robert that he look at himself, soft as cheese, well trained as a lap dog, afraid to lose the soft berth that had decayed him. Robert must have awakened under the sting of her words, packed a bag, returned to her cottage, only to find her body down on the beach.\n\nThe winds howled through Dorothy’s mind now, listening to them. In his way, Robert must have loved Janice intensely, for her death sent him dear out of his mind. All his paintings were found in his house, ripped to shreds. All that saved his wife was his thought he’d killed her when he struck her head against the patio pillar. He’d left her sheltered there, the carving knife at her side.\n\nRobert? Dorothy Janeway thought. There was a phrase she tried to remember, something about the Gods first making mad whom they would destroy.\n\nTears stung her lids, a faint moan escaped her lips.\n\n“Dorothy! Darling, this is Sue. I’m taking you home with me. Everything is all right. Doctor, she’s coming out of it. Can you hear me, Dorothy ? How do you feel, darling?”\n\nDorothy Janeway opened her eyes.\n\n“Feel?” she whispered. “I feel like a very hollow rusty little tin god. … “\n\n“Delirious,” said Mr. Conlan with a frown. “Well, I can always come back later.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

Curiously enough the history of this notorious killer and jail breaker, whom the newspapers once lightly termed the worst criminal in America, is a love story, a passion of the abyss.\n\nLate in the afternoon of the twenty-ninth of July, 1912, an excited young man, hat drawn down upon his eyes, entered the shop of a jeweler on Delancey Street, New York, and asked about a watch that had been left for repairs. A moment later he drew a pistol from his coat and shot the innocent watchmaker to death. Apparently the motive of this mad assassination was robbery, but the sound of his own pistol evidently frightened the man away, for he fled into the street, ran wildly through a crowd, dodged into one door of a crowded saloon and out the other, and so eluded his trembling pursuers.\n\nWithin forty minutes the same man walked into the side door of a cigar shop in Cooper Square and shot the legs from under an inoffensive clerk. Once more he fled without waiting to get any money, and within a few minutes two uniformed policemen ran him down in a cellar, where the killer surrendered without a struggle, though he was doubly armed and had a pocket full of ammunition.\n\nThis lunatic gunman proved to be Reynolds Forsbrey. His name and face were not new to the police. As a boy he had been taken for attempted forgery, and at the age of fifteen he had been sent to the House of Refuge for a term of four years. Thereafter, while still a minor, he was caught trying to be a burglar, and he was sent to Elmira, where his criminal education made some progress. For, shortly after his release, he became a successful housebreaker and continued in this historic profession for two years. Then the law laid hold on him again and sent him to Sing Sing to “do” a couple of years.\n\nSomewhere along this juvenile pilgrimage through the deeps, Forsbrey had learned to take narcotics, and he came forth from the big house at Ossining a confirmed drug addict. This was the man who had killed one shopkeeper and fearfully wounded another on that declining afternoon in July. Some time earlier he had been suspected of another shopkeeper shooting in Brooklyn, which could not be proved against him, but in which he had participated, as now developed.\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Actuating Force Behind These Strange Crimes\n\nQuietly the police began to seek the actuating force behind these strange crimes of Forsbrey. Some were content to say that he was a drug fiend and let it go at that. The deeds of these unfortunates needed no motivation of others, who understood more clearly, continued to seek, and shortly they found Reynolds Forsbrey’s reason and motive cowering and waiting in a room in Brooklyn — a woman, the thing he loved.\n\nHer name was Margaret Ryan, and her story is simple and everlasting. A girl of twenty, with the light of innocence still in her eyes, she had met Forsbrey at a public dance and come to love him.\n\nShe was a stenographer and an orphan, lonely and starved for tenderness, living restrictedly in the home of an aunt. She had known nothing about the man’s record or character, and she had never doubted that he was what he seemed to be and actually was by trade, a poor young plumber.\n\nThe two had met and struck fire in some strange, subtle way. They had planned to elope, and on that afternoon when Forsbrey went out and shot down two men, she had been left waiting for him in that sordid Brooklyn room. He had gone to get the money to make their wedding possible, but he had not told her how he planned to have it. All this terrible story the police fed her, after they had found her and dragged her from her room to question her. When she could no longer doubt that the man she loved was a discharged patient of prisons and a killer, she said simply:\n\n”I don’t care what he has done; I love him. He may be all you say. I didn’t know it, but it doesn’t make any difference. He was kind and gentle to me, and I love him.”\n\nHer inquisitors stared at her and never forgot.\n\nChapter 3\n\nForsbrey’s Astounding Performance In Jail Breaking\n\nForsbrey was sent to the Tombs to wait trial for murder, and Margaret Ryan was set free. Here began Forsbrey’s astounding performance in jail breaking and the girl’s humble and terrible devotion.\n\nJust a month after his apprehension Forsbrey was found in his Tombs cell, with a bottle of hydrochloric acid and three saws, trying to cut the bars and get away. He was immediately transferred to another cell, and a trusty prisoner was stationed before it to see that nothing more came of this man’s wild attempts at liberation. Margaret Ryan had brought him the saws concealed as stays in her corsets, and the bottle of acid was wrapped in the coils of her hair.\n\nForsbrey laughed when they took his tools of freedom from him and put him in the isolation cell.\n\n”This place can’t hold me,” he said. “I’m going away from here.”\n\nThe keepers smiled, but four days later they gaped, for Forsbrey was gone.\n\nWhile the trusty was absent from before his cell, Forsbrey managed to loosen the screws in the ventilator grille in his narrow home, using the metal of his suspender buckles as a tool. Wrenching the iron register from its place, he laid it on the floor, squeezed his body through the opening into the air shaft, and then half slid, half dropped into the carpenter shop, two flights below.\n\nHere there was an aged keeper on guard, but this worthy gentleman had been out to a political dinner the night before and was sleeping off his over merriment.\n\nForsbrey walked out into the night-clad yard of this famous old jail, laid a plank against the high wall, crawled to the top, and dropped perilously into Center Street, where hardly a wheel moved or a footfall sounded, so empty are some of the busiest New York streets after night has descended.\n\nFor a month the police sought Forsbrey in vain, sending their warnings into all parts of the country and making vain guesses at his probable line of flight. Finally, through a blunder of his own, Forsbrey was found in a little apartment in a far corner of the Bronx, living sedately with Margaret Ryan.\n\nNow he was permitted no further delays. The officers of the law felt it imperative to get this man inside one of the great prisons at once, so they accepted his plea of guilty of murder in the second degree, and a few days later Forsbrey was in Sing Sing, sentenced to serve from twenty years to life.\n\nHe did not remain long in this house of bondage, but was speedily transferred to Dannemora, whose reputation as an unbreakable prison is wide and justified. Forsbrey was now in the strongest and most inaccessible of prisons, far from New York City and the aid of Margaret Ryan. No doubt he was secure at last, and the keepers and wardens of prisons might take their ease in their strange inns.\n\nForsbrey began in Dannemora that lasting and unwavering vigil over adverse circumstance that is the lot of every prisoner that would be free. He waited and watched and yearned. The letters came from Margaret Ryan at stated intervals, were duly read by the prison censor, officially stripped of anything objectionable, then grudgingly passed along to the waiting long-termer.\n\nHis answers were treated in the same way before they were sent out to Margaret Ryan. Some wondered at her devotion to a man who had no other correspondent on the planet. Most said, from the depth of experience, that she would forget in time. Her letters would grow shorter, and the intervals between them longer. At last she would write no more, and Forsbrey would sit utterly and interminably alone — like the others.\n\nBut there was in these two people the rare thing that upsets calculations and makes mock of wisdom. Even time could not sever them. A year passed without any cooling of their devotion. Then two years, and three and four. Her letters came as often as the prison regulations permitted, and just as often his went back.\n\nIn December, 1916, after Forsbrey had been four years confined in Dannemora, he made another bid for freedom and the society of this unforgotten, unforgetting girl.\n\nHe was employed in the machine shop of Dannemora, where his practice as a plumber made him useful. Here he secretly constructed a heavy cannister of sheet iron, into which he poured several gallons of gasoline. By applying pressure to this inflammable fluid through a force pump in the shops, he hoped to make a bomb powerful enough to blow one of the guard towers from the corner of the prison wall, or tear out the end of a cell house.\n\nIn the commotion which would follow, he expected to scale the wall and get away. Forsbrey was forced to work on his bomb slowly and cautiously and only in odd moments of time, but he made progress with it, and in December of 1916 he decided it was ready to use.\n\nHe had now to his advantage the result of four years’ good conduct. The officials at Dannemora could find nothing in his record to warrant the apprehensions of the officers who had sent him there. Evidently the Forsbrey tradition was a myth, and he was no more difficult to detain than other men. If he had ever been a determined escaper he had got over it, as the four years of exemplary conduct proved.\n\nConsequently his mail was no longer carefully watched, and there was a general tendency to be lenient with him, for he could be as affable and gentle as a boy. Thus Forsbrey managed to communicate to Margaret Ryan the fact that he had prepared a bomb and was ready to try again.\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Pair of Riding Horses, Food, and Arms\n\nThe girl rushed up to Plattsburg by the first train, carrying the money she had been able to save in the years of Forsbrey’s confinement. Her wages had been hoarded in the hope that they would one day be used to reunite her with her lover. It was the deep of the Northern winter, and the snow choked every road and lay high upon the trees in the vast forests that clothe that region with austere beauty. Yet she determined that there was one way to freedom in case Forsbrey should break from the walls. The road to Canada lay buried in terrifying depths of snow, but she believed she might fight her way across the border with her lover, if the chance came.\n\nAccordingly, she hired a pair of riding horses, prepared food and arms, then made her way to the vicinity of the prison to wait for Forsbrey’s issue.\n\nBut two days before this unhappy man was ready to spring his coup the officers found the gasoline bomb and destroyed it. So Margaret Ryan waited vainly in the white, ironic wilderness.\n\nShe was finally picked up by local police and sent back to New York, with a warning. And on the twenty-eighth of December Forsbrey was transferred to Auburn Prison. He had got the run of things at Dannemora, and it was considered policy to send him to another jail, where he would not be familiar with the routine and the conditions of his detaining house.\n\nAt the same time the officials of the prisons dealt him the bitterest blow of all. They had seen how the cureless passion for the girl outside had almost succeeded in providing an escape for Forsbrey, and they determined to sever her from him completely. Forsbrey was denied the privilege of sending or receiving mail. He lay in his prison utterly alone, with the hunger for this distant, but devoted, woman eating into his brain.\n\nThe prison authorities had not yet gauged this man or his need. He had failed at Dannemora, and failure has never yet wrung much respect from men. In spite of his earlier exploits, Forsbrey was regarded as a common type of prisoner. Worst of all, no one understood the thing that impelled him to demolish the bars of his prisons. A love-driven criminal was a man beyond the reckoning of the officials.\n\nFour months after his transfer to Auburn, however, Forsbrey was to cut a deeper furrow into the memory of his keepers’ brains. He was not closely confined at Auburn, but was allowed the liberty of the prison, along with the fifteen hundred other men. Some added care was taken, but on the whole he was free to do as he liked. Prowling about the prison yard, ever seeking the weakness that would open the way to freedom for him, Forsbrey noticed that an aged guard held the office of turnkey at one of the important rear gates.\n\nWith the keys to the doors this man sat behind a set of bars. If he opened these inner gates, the outer barrier was still locked. Whoever has been in a prison understands this double-locking system. On entering, one set of gates is closed and locked behind the entrant before the second set is opened. It is an old precaution against a sudden rush of convicts. Forsbrey saw this old man at the double gates, and he had an idea.\n\nWith a bundle of soiled laundry in his hands, a few morning’s later, Forsbrey sauntered across the prison yard. He approached the wicket of the old turnkey, signaled for the open gate, and was dimly scrutinized. The old man supposed that this must be some prisoner on a casual errand, and he opened the gate. Forsbrey pulled the door far open, deposited his bag on the floor, and turned as if to go. Instinctively the old guard stooped to pick up the bundle, and instantly Forsbrey struck him down with a hammer which he had concealed in his sleeve. Then he beat the old warder insensible, stripped him of his keys, opened the outer gate, and was free.\n\nBut, once outside the walls, Forsbrey displayed that helplessness that characterizes many of the most notable jail breakers. He had been unable to make preparations or receive the aid of confederates, and he stood before the glowering walls of Auburn, free, but unable to hold his advantage. He struck out blindly, without plan or reason, and a few hours later a hound traced him to a neighboring hayloft, where he meekly submitted to rearrest, and was taken back to Auburn.\n\nBecause of his attempted flight from Dannemora nine years had been added to Forsbrey’s term. Now a second impost of nine years was laid upon his life, so that he stood committed to a term of twenty years to life, plus eighteen years. This may seem a little illogical, but it is so written upon the legal records of the prisons.\n\nChapter 5\n\nIsolation\n\nAt last the prison officials began to see the character and powers of this sad man. He could be trifled with no longer. Henceforward he would spend his life in the isolation ward.\n\nInside the walls at Auburn is a semidetached modern building of stone and steel, one story in height and containing twenty-four detached cells, each with its small exercise yard behind it. These cells and small yards are arranged back to back, in two equal rows of twelve each, and around them all is an encircling corridor or passage, so that the watching keepers may saunter completely around these rows of cells, as a patrolman on his beat may walk around a block of houses. Beyond the corridor lies the building wall of heavy masonry, with barred windows near the ceiling. At either end is a double steel door, with at least one turnkey always on duty. And beyond these doors or gates lies the prison.\n\nEach of the twenty-four isolation cells is a detached room, not more than eight by ten, and perhaps nine feet high. In the front is a barred steel door secured by ponderous double locks. In the rear wall of each cell is a solid steel door, which allows the prisoner to reach his exercise yard when it is unlocked by a keeper. To the left of each such door and near the top of each cell is a small barred window.\n\nThe exercise yard is of the same size and construction as the cell itself, save that it has no roof except a complete grille of one-inch steel bars, set about five inches apart and firmly held in concrete and masonry. All the floors and sidewalls of the cells and exercise yards are of hopelessly thick stone slabs, firmly cemented into place.\n\nInto one of these little tombs Reynolds Forsbrey was locked.\n\n”Let’s see you get out of here, my boy!” exclaimed the keeper.\n\nIt was a bit of justifiable prison pride, for these isolation cells were considered the last word in security. No one might hope to break from one of them. Let Forsbrey try his luck. He had against him not only the vault-like security of these awesome cells and this hopeless building, but there were special provisions of routine to add to the escaper’s discouragement.\n\nSo that no man might get used to his cell and find some weakness in it, the prisoners in the isolation ward were moved from cell to cell every few days, in an endless rotation. The man who was in cell No. I to-day was in cell No. 3 before the week’s end, and it took him two or three months to get back to his first cell, in case he had any deviltry afoot there. Moreover, a keeper was stationed inside the isolation ward day and night, and it was his duty to walk around the corridor every half hour and peer into each and every cell.\n\nCould Forsbrey beat this terrifying place? His keepers smiled with confidence, but his fifteen hundred fellows, with whom he was now elevated among the heroes, gave him their hopes.\n\nForsbrey sat down on his stool in his solitary cell and said not a word. This was to be his home for eighteen years beyond his natural life, or so the law said. Well, if he must have the patience to suffer the penalty he must have the resolution to escape it. He waited and watched. Nothing happened. The drab uneventfulness of prison shrouded him. No word was allowed to reach him from the single being toward whom his shackled dreams went out.\n\nThe spring and summer crept past, funereal procession of endless and starless nights, succeeded by brief days, on each of which the guarded man was let into the sunshine of his exercise yard for one hour, to pace like a bear in a den and stare upward through the bars at the remote freedom of the clouds and sky. The courage must have sunk out of any heart, but not Forsbrey’s. He saw the hopelessness of his confinement, and yet he hoped and planned. There was no way, and yet he cut one out of chance and desperation. And thereby the demoniac drug taker and killer changed the abhorrence of other men into a sure, if grudging, admiration. For the celebrity which he had achieved as a jail breaker proved to be the outward key for Forsbrey in the greatest of all his breaks.\n\nIn the autumn of 1917, after Forsbrey had been six months in the isolation ward at Auburn, it was decided to transfer a number of prisoners from this impregnable house to Dannemora, among them a certain French prisoner from a town near the Canadian border. This transfer did not apparently affect Forsbrey in any way, and he took little interest in it until a few nights before the move was made. The prisoners in the isolation ward had just been shifted again, and Forsbrey found himself in a cell next to that of the Frenchman. In the middle of the night Forsbrey heard a tapping on his wall in the old code of signals familiar to all long-term men. Forsbrey listened and responded by similar rappings. Finally, after patient effort, he was able to get the message:\n\nThe outgoing Frenchman had a saw hidden in the weight box of the window in cell No. 3. He could not take it out with him, but he wanted Forsbrey to have it. Good luck!\n\nSo the battle with the watchfulness of the keepers began. It was four weeks before Forsbrey got to cell three. In the night he managed to pry out the wooden front of the sash-weight box, and there he found the thin steel hand with the hard, fine teeth. It was true!\n\nAgain the difficulties under which this man worked must be made clear. Every day the cells were inspected by the keepers for the express purpose of making sure that no sawing or digging was going on. Every half hour in the day and night a keeper came to the cell door and peered in to be certain that the prisoner was making no attempt to escape.\n\nIf Forsbrey was to cut a bar, he must do it a few slashes at a time, in these half-hour intervals, without noise. He must then manage to conceal the cut so that the keepers might not find it on their daily inspections. But, even if he succeeded in all this, would he be transferred from cell No. 3 before he was able to make his dash for liberty ? And if he managed to cut a bar on the window of his cell and get out into the exercise yard, how was he going to manage to cut a second bar in that steel grille which roofed the yard?\n\nObviously, with a keeper coming every half hour to peer into his cage, Forsbrey must have both bars cut before he tried his break. The determined prisoner saw what the men who built the isolation ward had missed. By standing on his washstand he could reach out through the bars of his window and touch the bars which formed the roof of the exercise yard.\n\nSo it was possible to cut the roof bar first and then the window bar. If he could manage to conceal the marks of the saw in the steel till the job was done, there was hope. He would at least be outside in the prison inclosure, with no task before him but the scaling of the high wall.\n\nThis astounding man attacked the hopeless problem with the skill and courage which made him worthy of human attention and sympathy. First he hacked the bar in the roof grille at its farther end, as far out as he could reach. He would take a few hacks at it and then return to his bed, pretending to sleep. The keeper came on his half-hour round and saw the notorious escaper snugly in his cot.\n\nAs soon as the man was far enough down the corridor, Forsbrey was up on the washstand again, tearing fiercely at the steel with his saw teeth. In two nights he managed to cut the bar nearly through, so that it hung at one end by a thread. He had still to cut the near end of this bar and the second bar in his cell window.\n\nWell, so much had been done. Forsbrey filled up the cut with dust and covered it over with a little green paint scraped from the other bars. Then he dropped his saw back into the weight box of his window. The next day he was transferred from cell No. 3.\n\nAt the end of six weeks he was back in this den, whose darkness was so suddenly illumined with hope. He attacked the bar in the window and cut it almost through at one end, in a single night, while the warder walked past every half hour and peeped in at the inert convict under his blanket.\n\nOn the second night Forsbrey cut the window bar at the other end, and now it hung only by two thin fibers of metal. A stout jerk would pull it out of place and make an opening about eight by fourteen inches, through which Forsbrey was certain he could force his lithe body. Once more he filled the cuts with earth and plaster dust, covered the surface with scrapings of green paint, and lay down to wait for the inspection of his cell.\n\nAbout noon the keepers came, let him into his exercise yard, and then inspected the cage for signs of trouble. By some evil chance one of them took hold of the window bars and shook them vigorously. Forsbrey’s heart stood still. But the keeper happened to catch hold of one of the sound bars, and nothing happened. Only one end of the bar in the roof of the exercise yard, only a few hours of cutting, stood between the prisoner and freedom. He was already exulting at the issue when the order came to change cells again. Two months went by before Forsbrey again saw the inside of cell No. 3.\n\nChapter 6\n\nFortuitous Circumstances\n\nIt was the seventh of March, 1918. Now his time had come. At eleven o’clock in the night the keeper in the isolation ward made his rounds and saw that all the men were quiet in their cells. He had just peered into the last cell, No. 24, and gone back to his chair to take his ease till the eleven-thirty round, when he heard a noise and jumped up to investigate. As chance would have it, he started around the corridor from left to right, so that he reached cell No. 24 first and cell No. 1 last.\n\nThis fortuitous circumstances gave Forsbrey ten or twelve minutes, the time it took the warder to make the rounds. Had the keeper started in the other direction he must have reached cell No. 3 in less than a minute, and he would have caught the escaping prisoner before he could have got through the roof of the yard. As it was, the astounded keeper found this cage empty, and Forsbrey was gone. What he had heard was the snapping of the bars and the struggle of Forsbrey to drag his body through the narrow hole in the window grille and then through a hole in the roof of the yard.\n\nImmediately there was an instant alarm and precipitate pursuit. The convict had a start of not more than fifteen minutes, and the officers believed he must still be inside the walls. But here they erred, and thereby added to the escaper’s lead.\n\nForsbrey, once he had got to the top of the isolation ward, ran along the roof to the farther end, where the building abuts the prison lumber yard. Here he hung by his hands and dropped into the mud and slush below. Picking himself up, he dragged a long piece of lumber from a stack and laid it diagonally against the outer wall of the prison, a trick he had employed earlier in escaping from the Tombs. Crawling up this board like a monkey he gained the top of the wall and then, hanging by his hands once more, let himself fall.\n\nThe moment he landed upon the hard, cold ground he must have been overcome with misgiving and terror. All this indescribable waiting and watching, all this prodigious labor, all these risks and vigils — and for what?\n\nHere he was just outside the wall, in prison clothes, unarmed, without money, without a confederate, hundreds of miles from the nearest friend or a city with whose underworld he was associated. There was no cover for him at hand, and only the rarest chance of reaching a place of hiding remained. The situation must have overwhelmed him. Before him stretched a single road, and he took it. He fled eastward, hoping to catch a train and get as near New York as possible before the telegraph and telephone would bar all lines of advance.\n\nAll things considered, he managed well enough. The searching parties that went out from prison and the posses that formed everywhere, as soon as the news of his escape got abroad, were unable to find him for forty-eight hours.\n\nBut late on the second night after his flight some railroad workmen in the little town of Locke, twenty miles from Auburn, saw a man skulking in a box car and immediately concluded that this might be the celebrated Forsbrey. They did not dare tackle so notorious a criminal alone, so they sent word to the prison, and an armed patrol was hurried out to investigate. Before the officers could arrive the man in the car was overcome with hunger and went to a near-by cottage to beg food. With this he returned to his hiding place and sat down to appease his gnawing appetite. He was still munching when half a dozen gun barrels peered through the car door at him, and the chase was at an end. The man who could perform such marvels inside his prison did not know enough to board only a moving train, or to steal food if he must have it.\n\nForsbrey went back to Auburn and his isolation cell, and a few days later he was transferred back to Dannemora, the prison he had not been able to beat. When they brought Forsbrey back to Auburn from the box car where he had been hiding, he was taken before the warden.\n\n”If you’d let me hear from Margaret Ryan,” he said hopelessly, “I wouldn’t be trying to escape.”\n\nThe writer of this article arrived at Auburn a few days later and talked with the warden; he found the prison official under no illusions about his man. There was no question that the fever of love for this chance-met girl was the driving power behind all the strange, dark labors and high achievements of this famous jail breaker.\n\n”But what can one do?” asked the warden. “If we let them correspond, she helps him to plot escapes; and if we don’t let them write, he is all the more determined.”\n\nChapter 7\n\nMelancholy Romance\n\nIt has been four years since Forsbrey last broke his chains,, and perhaps he will try no more. Failure may have chastened him, and luck deserted him.\n\nThe woman in this melancholy romance has not been more kindly dealt with than the man who loves her. When Forsbrey went to prison she set out to get money for his assistance by any means that came her way. She threw herself again and again at the barriers of the law. She tried to match her feeble strength and fragile charm against an adverse world, and she was soon undone.\n\nThe dark substreams of metropolitan life had shortly caught her in their deepest currents. She floated a while, washed from place to place, like driftwood. Then she gave it up one night, turned on the gas, and swallowed poison; but her room was entered in time, and she was dragged back from the grave.\n\nOn her dresser was a note: “I am Margaret Ryan, the sweetheart of Reynolds Forsbrey.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Massenet’s Elegy\n  The Law of Compensation\n  I Told Him My Secret\n  A Literary Effort\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nMassenet’s Elegy\n\nTomorrow at 7:32 a.m. I shall have reached the end of my thirty-fifth year.\n\nI have prepared a program for the morning that I have well-considered for fifteen years. At 6:30 I shall arise and breakfast with good appetite. From 7 to 7:25 I shall occupy myself in filling the bath-tub and regulating the temperature of the water. It will take at least fourteen minutes to get the exact warmth desired, something between 98 and 99 degrees, Fahrenheit.\n\nHaving completed this task to my satisfaction I shall go into the living room, place a record of Massenet’s Elegy on the music machine and start it off, softly and slowly. I shall then return to the bathroom. Again testing the water and regulating the flow of hot and cold to maintain the required temperature I shall climb into the tub. With a razor I shall cut the arteries in both wrists.\n\nThis will be done at 7:32 exactly — the hour of my birth and the end of my thirty-fifth year.\n\nI shall lie back contentedly and laugh. My body and the water, being in caloric harmony, there will be no pain. This I have learned of the Romans, who, of all men, know best how to live splendidly and die luxuriously. To the compassionate music of the Elegy I shall glide and melt into the Infinite with the quiet smile of a victor.\n\nFor I shall have defeated the Law of Compensation, beaten it as it never has been beaten before.\n\nI am not insane. A cringing, spiritless, whining world will doubtless call my act one of an unbalanced mentality but what care I? I have no reason that society would accept for this deed of self-elimination. I have no financial difficulties, no worries prey on me, my health is perfect, I have not been unsuccessful in love — in fact, as I write this tonight, I am exuberantly and exultingly happy and care-free. When the cat pounces the rat will not be there. I can picture his look of chagrin.\n\nI am putting this on paper, not that others may profit by my example, for I know they will not. Frankly, I am doing it in a spirit of braggadocio. I want a world of rats to know that one rat has escaped the claws of the inevitable. I want it known that the years that are mine I have taken and used to the utmost. The years that Compensation takes unto itself I shall not intrude upon. We are quits. We are breaking even and to break even with it is victory for me — complete, smashing, thorough and absolute.\n\nEven at the risk of being tedious I shall go into some details for it is only in this way that the full extent of my triumph can be made plain to a race of futile, unthinking, servile pawns.\n\nWhen I was twelve years old my father died. He was in the thirty-sixth year at the time. He had been ill for many months with a malady that must have been extremely painful. His groans broke into my sleep at all hours of the night. I often heard him plead with the doctor for morphine.\n\n”If I only could die,” he moaned in his agony.\n\nI remember the sufferings of my mother as she nursed him. She had been a pretty and joyous creature but in those dreadful months the pink in her cheeks fled before a dead sallowness, the eyes that had once laughed and sparkled with the joy of living lay drearily deep behind dark circles, the lustre departed from her hair, a hopeless stoop came into her shoulders and the shuffle of despond into her feet.\n\nI think I was glad when my father died. I cried at the funeral, not because of his passing, but because of her he had left behind — that broken, crushed mother of mine.\n\nAt twelve one is not given much to speculation or introspection, yet I wondered. Why had my father been tormented so? His death I understood clearly. That was merely the end, and I knew that all things had to end, but why the torture of his last hours?\n\nHe had been a kind-hearted, gentle soul, considerate and self-sacrificing. He had worked hard for mother and me, he had given of his substance to the needy and bent a shoulder to the feeble. His life had been clean and wholesome, yet he had been smitten with flaming darts. I could think of no reason.\n\nSix months afterwards my mother died. She, too, suffered greatly, I know, but so weak was she in spirit and body that no voice was left loud enough to cry her agony. My wonder increased. Why had she been smitten so?\n\nI went to live with my father’s brother. Uncle John was thin and inclined to irritability, yet he treated me with much kindness, unsmiling but very real. I remember one evening when Aunt Susan had sharply called me in from play to my neglected studies, he had said:\n\n”Let the boy alone with his fun. Later on he will have troubles enough. Don’t rob him of his blessed childhood.”\n\nAnd he had sighed.\n\nThere were two other members of the family, one a boy about my age, good-natured and full of animal spirits, the other an older sister of Aunt Susan, a sweet-tempered, self-effacing little woman, who had been born a cripple. One leg was shorter than the other. Congenital hip-disease, they called it. I grew very fond of Aunt Stella.\n\nUncle John was troubled with dyspepsia. After each cautious meal he took pills. They didn’t seem to help him much for I still recall his distress on the few occasions when he grew reckless and tasted of forbidden things. I remember the half-sorrowful, half-envious look in his eyes as he watched George and me romp around the place, slide down the balustrades and in other boyish ways give ear to the call of strident vitality within us. The wistful eyes that observed us as we gorged at meal times come vividly before me, even now.\n\nOne winter’s day when the sidewalks were icily slick, Aunt Stella fell on the sidewalk and hurt her bad hip. There was an operation, gangrene and finally the great emancipation.\n\n”Uncle,” I said, three days after the funeral, “why did Aunt Stella suffer so?”\n\nHe seemed startled for a moment. Then he answered:\n\n”My boy, when you are about twice as old as you are now you will understand. It is the law of compensation. We all must pay for what we take out of life.”\n\nI questioned him further but he would not pursue the subject. I didn’t sleep much that night. My mind was racing with the problem of compensation but making little headway. In the course of a restless doze I dreamed that angels and demons were fighting for the possession of my body. The angels seemed to be hopelessly outnumbered and were getting the worst of it when suddenly they came over to the side of the demons and joined them sticking knives and pitchforks into me.\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Law of Compensation\n\nLife at Uncle John’s soon returned to its normal gait. George and I again romped all over the place although I felt myself a bit subdued and prone to spells of puzzled reflection. My Uncle’s attacks of dyspepsia continued and Aunt Susan complained almost constantly of feeling poorly without any definite ailment as far as I could learn.\n\nWe had many visitors. Mostly they were men and women in the late thirties and forties. Although much of the conversation was beyond me I liked to sit quietly in the large living room and listen to the callers. I believe it was during this period that my views relative to the Law of Compensation took coherent shape.\n\nWhile my foster-parents’ friends discussed every subject under the sun there was one topic upon which each and all spoke fluently and often — their ailments. Everybody seemed to have something the matter with him or her.\n\nMrs. Austin had neuralgia, Mr. Hawkins had a heart lesion, Mr. Swift suffered from constant, inexplicable pains in the back, Mrs. Steffens brooded about an incipient goitre, Mr. Holliday was worried with a tenacious cough and Mrs. Taylor’s stoutness preyed on her mind.\n\nOf all the visitor’s my favorite was John Shelton, a school principal. He had no particular malady except that his eyes gave him trouble. He complained that they hurt when he read at night.\n\n”Mr. Shelton,” I said to him one evening when we happened to be alone in the living room, “do all people get sick when they get to be thirty or thereabouts?”\n\nHe laughed good-naturedly.\n\n“That’s a funny question. Of course, not.”\n\n”Why is it, then,” I asked, “that people of that age are always talking about their ailments or looking worried? There’s you, for example. Why aren’t you happy all the time, like I am?”\n\n”Oh, you’re young,” he replied. “You have no cares, no responsibilities. There’s nothing to keep you from being contented twenty-four hours in the day.”\n\n”That’s what I thought,” I replied. “As you grow older you get the things that make you unhappy.”\n\n“That’s the way of life,” he answered soberly. “Take my advice, young man, and get all the pleasure you can out of your boyhood. The sweetness of living is now yours.\n\nSuddenly he turned with a laugh and said:\n\n”Paul, do you know where your heart is?”\n\n”Certainly,” and I struck my left side with the hand.\n\n”You’re wrong,” he smiled. “It’s here!”\n\nHe pointed to a spot three inches to the right of the place I had indicated and two inches lower.\n\n“Know where your stomach is?”\n\nI showed him where I thought it was.\n\nApparently I knew less about the stomach than I did about the heart. I was somewhat ashamed and told Shelton that we had just started the study of anatomy at high school.\n\n”Books will never tell you just where your vital organs are,” he said, “and the longer you remain in ignorance the better off you will be. When you do learn exactly where your stomach is, it will be the finger of pain pointing it out. Suffering is the perfect instructor in anatomy.”\n\nJust at that time other callers arrived and the questions trembling on the point of my tongue went unasked. Afterward he avoided the subject of anatomy.\n\nChapter 3\n\nI Told Him My Secret\n\nThe next three years passed rapidly, happy, joyous, unrestrained years. My plan of life was rapidly developing. I was determined to squeeze out of existence every drop of happiness it contained before the location of my heart was known to me with exactness.\n\nWhen I was not playing I observed men and women along novel lines. I read faces for signs of content and unhappiness. I fell into the habit of checking up the number of times I had seen this or that individual in a month, how many times he had been smiling, how many times he had been frowning, how often he had appeared at ease, how often worried. I did not let these studies interfere with my main program. I sought enjoyment with almost hysterical insistence. I would permit nothing to depress me, nothing to divert me from my purpose.\n\nAt eighteen I was sent to college. Because knowledge came easily I was a good student. Had it been otherwise I would have quit the pursuit of learning and sought less strenuous occupation.\n\nI had a room-mate, Arthur Gates, a jolly, harum-scarum, rich man’s son, who worshipped at the shrine of Play as feverishly as I. Although he was not lacking in serious moments he was dumfounded, I know, when I told him my secret.\n\nWe had been in the history lecture class together that afternoon when the instructor suddenly turned pale, clutched his coat lapel and fell at the foot of his desk. He was a man of about forty and seemingly had been in good health. We helped take him home. I learned that he was a sufferer from angina pectoris, an unusually painful affliction of the heart.\n\nIn our room that evening Gates mentioned the instructor’s illness.\n\n”That could never happen to me,” I remarked.\n\n”Why?” he asked. “Have you a guarantee on your heart?”\n\n”No,” I answered slowly, “but I shall not live that long.”\n\n”What are you talking about? Duckworth isn’t over forty-five.”\n\n“When my forty-fifth birthday comes around,” I replied calmly, “I know I will have been dead ten years.”\n\nGates laughed.\n\n”Been to see a fortune teller?” he jeered.\n\n”No, but on the day that I finish my thirty-fifth year I shall kill myself.”\n\n”How do you know,” asked my room-mate, “that you won’t get angina before you’re thirty-five?”\n\n”I don’t, but it’s hardly likely. The percentage is in my favor.”\n\nGates was beginning to be impressed with the fact that I was serious. He gazed at me with puzzled eyes.\n\n”Arthur,” I said. “I want you to listen to me for a few moments. What I am about to tell you I have told to no other person and will tell to no other person. I feel that I must unbosom myself to someone. Will you listen seriously?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\nI went on:\n\n”I am now twenty-one years old. I have excellent health, plenty of money, no troubles, domestic or otherwise, and what are regarded as excellent prospects. Yet, I tell you in cold blood that at 7:32 a. m., on April 6th, 1920, I shall end my life. That will be the exact hour of my birth, thirty-five years before. Just how I shall do it I do not yet know. Naturally I shall take the least painful and least unpleasant way.”\n\n”But why?” interrupted Gates, who had been watching me with strange fascination.\n\n”That,” I replied, “will develop in the course of what I am about to tell you. Understand I am not trying to influence you in any way. I know that you will not agree with me. When I was a boy my father and mother both died in great agony. I can see them now, gray with torture, their pallid features furrowed with the lines of suffering and the perspiration of pain on their foreheads.\n\n“I can still hear my father pleading for death — death that stood outside the door leeringly biding its time.\n\n”Afterwards I lived for many years at the home of an uncle. There I saw more suffering. I began asking myself these questions — Is life worth living? If so, how long should one live? When do the tears of existence begin to outweigh the smiles? At what point in the span do the joys of carrying on no longer balance the sorrows?\n\n”In seeking answers to my interrogations I made a close and detailed study of scores of men and women. I watched their faces and searched their souls. I have continued the researches at college, coldly, scientifically. I have tables and charts and masses of statistics, and the conclusions I reached by observation have been borne out by analysis and precise data. And my conclusion is this: The average life after thirty-five is not worth living.”\n\nI saw a “why” trembling on Gates’ lips and went on:\n\n”The span of human life is seventy years. In the first thirty-five we sow, in the other thirty-five we reap. It is the Law of Compensation. The pleasures and enjoyment of existence are freely bestowed in the first half of the span, but the bills begin coming in with the thirty-sixth year. I have made up my mind not to pay. When the collector comes I will be out.”\n\nMy room-mate shook his head.\n\n“That’s certainly a bizarre theory,” he said.\n\n”It’s not theory,” I returned. “It’s a fact, a grim, irresistible fact. As I told you, I have reached my conclusions by way of scientific research.”\n\n”But how?” asked Gates. “I don’t understand.”\n\n”For example,” I replied, “I have gone to a man of thirty-seven night after night for a month and reviewed the entire day with him. I have tabulated the whole of his waking hours under three heads — Joy, Sorrow, Neutral.\n\n“Under the first caption I have listed everything, no matter how trivial, that afforded the subject content or satisfaction.\n\n“Under Sorrow I have scheduled every disappointment, every ache, every annoyance, no matter how petty — everything he had hoped would not happen, and so on.\n\n“Under Neutral I have put these things that could not properly be classed under either of the other headings.”\n\n”And the result?”\n\n”In the particular case I am speaking of there were twi:e as many notations under Sorrow as there were under Joy. I conducted my inquiries with a great number of men and women over a long period and the results were about the same. With younger persons it was just the reverse. The dividing line seemed to be just at thirty-five. Between thirty and thirty-five the Joys and Sorrows about balanced with a great number of notations in the Neutral column. Under thirty the Joys and Neutrals seemed to have the field pretty well to themselves.”\n\n”Often, of course, the Law of Compensation begins operating lightly and years may elapse before the victim notices that he is being dunned for payment. But settlement must be made and it is made through the body, through those held dear, through ambition, pride, vanity, through everything that is cherished and clung to. But I am going to dance and leave without paying the piper.”\n\nGates listened quietly to my conclusion and with serious expression.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, he said, “The ordinary person would laugh at you, Paul, and call you crazy, but I believe that I understand you. Boyhood sorrows have merely distorted your views of life. I have no doubt of your sincerity and I do not question that right now you believe that you will kill yourself when you are thirty-six. Permit me, as a friend, to doubt it. I venture to say that you will be married in 1920, be the father of several children and would blush and stammer like a schoolgirl if I should happen along and repeat what you have just told me. You are young and in the next fifteen years your conception of life will undergo a radical series of changes.”\n\n”No, Arthur,” I returned, “I shall not change my mind. I propose to enjoy the time I have allowed myself to the utmost. At the end of that period you will read of my death — if you haven’t forgotten all about me. That’s all. Let’s go down town, have a few drinks and see a show.”\n\nGates was glad to go. I never mentioned the subject of my plans to him again. During some of our boisterous celebrations I often caught a queer smile in his eyes, but he said nothing.\n\nAfter graduation we separated. Gates went to his home in California while I moved to New York. For a few years we corresponded in a loose fashion and then lost touch.\n\nI lived up to my set program. With a generous income I was able to do about what I pleased. I went where I wished, ate and drank what and where I wanted, and did little work except that connected with looking after my property. I remained free of serious love entanglements, my health continued excellent and I had no worries. I do not recall an ache or a pain or a severe disappointment in fifteen years.\n\nThere was a girl — her name is of no moment — a girl of wondrous beauty and celestial character, who did stagger my resolution for a brief spell. When I felt myself weakening I went to Bellevue Hospital where I knew a house surgeon, and walked through the wards. The Law of Compensation was operating on high gear that evening. I finished my tour, had a good laugh and never saw her again.\n\nSo this is the last night. I feel strangely happy. For my final repast I have ordered a royal gorge. I shall dine heartily at midnight and drink many a glass of rare vintage to the vanquished Law of Compensation. Then to bed for a few hours of calm rest. After that, tomorrow morning and 7:32.\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Literary Effort\n\nThe following letter was received in the coroner’s office from Dr. J. P. Sypes:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe enclosed communication or manuscript was found on a table in the room where Paul Traverse died last night. His death was entirely natural and was due, as stated in the burial certificate, to acute gastritis. The attack followed upon an unusually heavy meal he had eaten before retiring. The matter I am sending you was, I presume, a literary effort on his part.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

      "content_html": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of the microscope in conjunction with photography is now an established branch of police science. One of the most incredible convictions ever obtained in the United States by means of microphotography is related by J. H. Wigmore in his legal volume, “The Science of Judicial Proof,” wherein he quotes a report written by Luke May in the American Journal of Police Science — a report concerning the arrest and conviction of a kidnaper in a northwestern State.\n\nIt was on a December afternoon in 1928 that a little girl left school and started toward her small-town home, the path leading through a section of wooded country. As she walked through this patch of forest, she was seized from behind by a man who put a cloth over her head and face to muffle her outcries. Thus kidnaped, she was cruelly mistreated and subsequently released. She later told the authorities that her abductor had worn a white cloth mask to conceal his identity. Beyond this fact she could give only a meager description of her assailant.\n\nThe local sheriff and his deputies made an examination of the spot where the kidnaping had occurred, finding a cleverly constructed “blind” such as hunters sometimes erect when shooting at game birds. This blind was made of branches and saplings near a fir tree close to the trail through the forest. Several small branches had been hacked from the fir tree by means of a knife, the severed ends being thrust into the ground to afford concealment for the kidnapper as he lay in ambush.\n\nAround this same time, a man named Clark was arrested at a local hotel and held on suspicion. Among the various personal articles taken from him at the time of his arrest there was a pocket knife with three blades. Moreover, Clark’s room contained two cedar branches for Christmas decoration.\n\nTo the naked eye, neither these cedar boughs nor the three blades of Clark’s pocket knife revealed any identifying marks. Quizzed by the authorities, the prisoner admitted that he himself had cut the cedar branches with the knife under discussion, but he flatly denied having cut the lengths of fir at the scene of the attack on the little girl. He maintained that he knew nothing about the abduction.\n\nThe sheriff now turned over several items to Luke May’s police laboratory. These items included the fir boughs found at the woodland ambush, the knife taken from the prisoner, and the two lengths of cedar decoration from the defendant’s hotel room. All were examined microscopically.\n\nThis examination revealed pitch, such as exudes from fir trees, upon the largest blade of the knife. No other blades had pitch-stains on them. In addition, the largest blade showed microscopic serrations and irregularities on its cutting edge, as is usual with a knife which has been used and sharpened.\n\nTests were now made with the suspected blade. By means of a specially designed instrument, the knife was forced through of number of fir boughs and cedar sailings of the same size, and taken from the same trees, from which the “blind” had been cut at the scene of the crime.\n\nThese cuttings were placed under a comparison magnascope until it could be determined what angle the knife had been held when the ambush was whittled. This fact having been determined, the next step was to make microphotographs of the branches cut for ambush, the cedar boughs in the prisoner’s room, and marks made by the prisoner’s knife-blade upon saplings tested in the laboratory. And those microscopic markings matched identically in every detail!\n\nIn brief, just as a bullet can be matched up with the gun that fired it — through the science of ballistics — so also did science prove that the prisoner’s knife was the one that had cut the fix branches to build a “blind.”\n\nBy using a microscope, the law had got its man!\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

Moreover, one of the innumerable gritty particles which were continually working in around the window sash had got into Estelle Ballard’s eye. And, as if this was not enough to insure her discomfort, there was an eternal nerve-ragging duet of hopeless wailing from two grimy children who sat, or rather squirmed, about the seat and the floor, midway up the car.\n\nUnder the circumstances, Estelle Ballard was not a bit surprised at the return of her too-familiar headache, the headache which, with some of her other ills, she thought she had left up there in the mountains, under the influence of the bracing air and the unaccustomed restfulness. Not even the thought of the great new adventure on which she was embarking could ward off such purely physical discomfort. Rather, the reverse was true; her mind turned easily and naturally back into the old weary treadmill.\n\nSqualling children, poverty, discomfort; the everlasting excessive demands on her time, her patience, and her endurance — this was life! At least, it had been her life for seven years. There had been enough of it, and more, to deaden the buoyant romance, in whose grip, as a twenty-year-old girl, she had married Tom Ballard; enough of it, surely, for a lifetime!\n\nYet other people found things different; others avoided responsibility, lived in a quest for pleasures of all sorts, and found them. Other people had tasty homes, undefiled by the broken toys, tom papers, and other litter left by young savages. They had servants, money, time to enjoy the theater, luncheons in town, shopping trips — oh, everything!\n\nOnly some foolish women elected to undergo the other sort of life; some like herself, and like that bedraggled, weary-faced mother up ahead, who was vainly trying to soothe her young charges into quietness.\n\nA scornful laugh came to Estelle Ballard’s lips as she thought of her attitude only a few years before, when so many of her girl friends had studied stenography, or nursing, or something else preparatory to a vocation. None of that for her! The prosaic, work-a- day prospect had distinctly not appealed. But, thanks to her father’s guidance, she had taken a commercial course, had learned enough about bookkeeping and typewriting to be of help to him in his little retail business; although she had never intended to use her knowledge in any other way than that. Drudgery of any sort had never appealed to her. She had wanted, and had frankly stated so to her friends, love, romance — life!\n\nLife! Well, she had had it! Tied down for years, with no help but her own hands, no chance to leave the house even for an evening call on a neighbor. This was the very first vacation she had had; and, instead of filling her with eagerness to be back home, it had been all too short, had made the prospect of a return bitterly distasteful.\n\nOf course she couldn’t blame Tom Ballard. It was not really his fault — not in a moral sense, anyhow — that he did not get ahead more rapidly, that he did not make the huge sums of money which she knew she could so easily learn to spend and enjoy.\n\nHe was of the patient, plodding sort, the kind who would never make any startling success, unless by pure accident. He was the kind, too, for whom she did not need to dress up and appear at her best, when she was feeling at her worst. His affection was steady, unimpressed and unaltered by the things which he considered trifles, which he was as likely as not to fail to notice entirely.\n\nBut that didn’t help her case any! She had little enough to thank him for, anyway; even this vacation trip to the mountains, her first, he had insisted on only at the orders of the doctor. No; Tom could hardly have done otherwise; and the vacation, itself, had only whetted her appetite for the things that she had missed.\n\nEstelle Ballard laid her magazine in the seat beside her and devoted a few moments of successful attention to removing the cinder from her eye. A trainman popped his head in at the car door and called: “Fitchburg!”\n\nEstelle gave a start. Already? She noted with satisfaction that the mother with the two whining children was making preparations to leave the train here. And the headache which had so long bothered, began suddenly to disappear.\n\nIt must be the magic of the place, she thought. For this was the junction point, the beginning of her adventure. This was the place where, under other circumstances, she would have left the train and waited in the station for the accommodation train that would take her home to Sladeville.\n\nShe sat, very stiff and self-conscious, staring fixedly out the window, until the car began to move away from the station. Then she weakly relaxed and gave a huge sigh of relief. She had done it! She had not weakened, as she had feared. She was on her way to the big city — to Boston, to the new life of which she had dreamed! She seemed to have left her cares, her feeling of oppression, behind her with the flying landscape. Freedom!\n\nShe was in no mood to apologize to herself for the step she had taken; she was too gloriously, deliriously happy in it. All that she had missed for years was now to be hers — hers! No one to claim her time, to circumscribe her actions, her desires. Nothing to do but to earn a living, and she had little doubt that she could do that! For that matter, a very small wage would suffice at first; the freedom alone would be joy enough. Later, she could attain a position where she could satisfy her craving for the gayer things.\n\nThe children — well, they would not be so badly off as at first appeared. Tom’s maiden aunt, who was staying with them now, could continue her care of them. She might not be an ideal guardian, but neither had Estelle, herself, been. Her querulous temper, her too great proneness to scold and punish and nag, were bound to have a bad effect upon children of that age. It would be too bad for Tom, of course; he would feel her loss keenly.\n\nShe’d have to let him know, of course: write him, somehow, in such a way that he could not trace the letter. Otherwise he might think her dead, or kidnaped, and waste time and money and worry in trying to find her. She could spare him that by simply telling him the truth. Boston was a large enough place so that she could easily lose herself in it; a change of name was about all that would he necessary, except to keep out of the way of people there whom she and Tom both knew. It would be hard at first, of course; but in a few months at the most, every one concerned would be that happier for it — especially herself.\n\nOn the whole, they were pleasant thoughts that quickened the journey to the city. Estelle Ballard, in spite of her weeks of planning, had no very definite idea as to just what she would do first. The little money which she had been able to save out of her meager vacation allowance would hardly permit her to go to a hotel; she must immediately find a boarding house, from which, as a headquarters, she could seek work. It was nearly lunch time when the train pulled into the great gloomy shed of the North Station; she would get a paper, bring it with her to a lunch room, and scan its “board and rooms” columns while she ate.\n\n&amp;lt;h6 class=”btt&amp;gt;Back to Top&amp;lt;/h6&amp;gt;\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nIn A Strange City\n\nShe skipped nimbly down the car steps onto the platform. In addition to her hand bag she had but a single suit case, which she found no burden at all in her new-found strength, though a bit awkward to handle in the crowd.\n\nShe pushed through the throng to the nearest news stand and fumbled at her hand bag. Finally she sat her suit case down; it was too awkward, trying to open the bag with one hand. She unclasped the bag and the small pocket within it and reached for two pennies. As she drew them out a look of blank consternation was on her face. The pennies she found, and a few other bits of small change; but there should be bills there, too. She had been robbed!\n\nFor a moment terror gripped her. Alone, in a practically strange city, with less than eighty cents to her name! She carefully searched the bag once more. She was not mistaken; there was no more money in it. The bills which she had so carefully hoarded were gone!\n\nThe newspaper forgotten, Estelle Ballard thrust the change back into her bag, picked up her suit case, and thought quickly. Her numbed mind was unable to accept her loss. Why, she would not even have enough to go back to Sladeville — the place which, though she had deliberately cut loose from it, she still instinctively looked upon as a refuge in case of emergency. And this was on emergency!\n\nHer quick, frightened eyes roved about the station. It must have been after she alighted from the train, while she had been hurrying in the crowd through the train shed, that the theft had been consummated. In her haste she had brushed against many people; and she would not have noticed any slight touch at the bag which had been hung over her wrist. Moreover, she was sure that the money had been intact while she was in the train. But, out of the hundreds, who could it be? How could she possibly hope to identify the thief? She had noticed none of the people particularly — none but one crippled fellow, against whom she had bumped, and then apologized when she saw that he limped.\n\nSuddenly she saw the very person she had in mind, making, with a haste which was exaggerated by his painful limp, for one of the farther exits. Without pausing to think Estelle darted after him. He might be the robber; at any rate, she purposed to find out. Now that she thought of it, he had rather clumsily got into her way, it seemed; she had forgotten the fact in her pity for him. If he were, the fact that he had not already escaped could be explained by two things; first, his limping gait, and, second, his probable assumption that she would not look in her bag until she had left the station. He could not have guessed that she would stop at the very gate of the train platform to buy a paper.\n\nInto the street she determinedly sallied. The limping youth was still in sight — thanks to a press of traffic along the street which he had attempted to cross. His enforced pause in the middle of the highway enabled her to decrease the distance between them, and when he stepped onto the sidewalk she was not far behind.\n\nHe looked around furtively and saw her; his pace quickened, and he made for the doorway of a place whose fittings proclaimed it to have once been a saloon. Almost running, Estelle pursued. She spoke to him as he turned at the doorway.\n\n“Don’t go in there, or I’ll call the traffic policeman! Walk right on — I’ll walk with you.”\n\nAlmost to her surprise, he obeyed. The woman had spoken incautiously, thoughtlessly; but the youth’s sudden acquiescence indicated to her that he was indeed guilty. She fell into step beside him. Even then, she had a half-humorous thought that they must look to be an ill-assorted pair; he, with his shrunken, ill-clad body, his twisted leg, and his sallow, wizened face; she — but she, herself, Was probably not much to look at, after her seven years!\n\n“I want my money!” She spoke the words in a low voice, but decisively.\n\n“Money? What money, lady?”\n\nEstelle Ballard’s heart sank. If he were to brazen it out she could not prove that he had her money, even if her suspicion was correct.\n\n“That policeman is still within call,” she reminded. “I want that money. I know you’ve got it.”\n\nOne glance at her determined face and he weakened. He must be a very inexperienced crook, she thought, to be unaware of the strength of his position, or else a very experienced one, too well known to the police to risk investigation.\n\n“I — I!” he wavered.\n\n“Twenty-five dollars, it was,” she insisted. “I’ve a good mind to call the police, anyway. The idea! Robbing unsuspecting travelers.”\n\n“Don’t, lady!” he whined in real terror. “Don’t call the cops. I — I’ll give you money. I ain’t saying that I took yours, but — I’ll give you money. Only don’t call the cops!”\n\nIn his abject pleading his face looked pitiful. He was little more than a boy, after all, she thought.\n\n“How old are you?” she demanded, as he fumbled at his pocket.\n\n“Sixteen, lady. I — “\n\n“Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? Don’t you know where you’re bound to end up?” She began to feel a pity for the wizened boy.\n\n“I ain’t a crook — honest, lady! Not a Regular crook. I — I got to get a living, ain’t I ? And with this bum leg of mine — my old man done that to me when I was a baby.”\n\n“He — he did?” said Estelle sympathetically.\n\n“Yes. He was a sort of a bum, a no-good. But, bad as he was, he looked after me, in a kind of a way, till two years ago. Since then I’ve had to shift for myself, and I generally think I’m pretty lucky if I get enough to eat and a shake-down for the night. I don’t always get them, I’m telling you!”\n\nHe had produced two ten-dollar bills and a five — just the denominations which she had missed. The woman noted, too, that one of the bills was a note of a New Hampshire bank, thus confirming her belief that it was her own money.\n\n“But your mother,” she said in a low voice. “You must have had a mother?”\n\n“Yes. She was a lady, I guess! I don’t remember her much, but she was all right. She couldn’t stand the old man — she pulled out, beat it, a long time ago, and ain’t never been heard of since — not by me, anyhow.”\n\n“How old were you then?” The woman took the bills from his hand.\n\n“Five years, or somewheres around that.”\n\n“Oh!” Estelle’s breath unconsciously made the exclamation. Five — that was the age of her own eldest boy, her Jimmy.\n\n“Here!” she said quickly, as the youth started to slink away. “I — I can spare this — so you can have enough to eat and a place to sleep.”\n\nShe thrust one of the ten-dollar bills back into his hand. “For the sake of your mother — the mother who deserted.”\n\nWith scarcely a “thank you,” he was gone, around a corner. As Estelle Ballard turned to retrace her steps to the station she came face to face with a policeman.\n\n“You’re a stranger here, aren’t you, ma’am?” inquired the officer. “You have to be careful about people you meet on the street. Lots of robberies lately. That fellow you were just talking to, now — you haven’t been robbed, have you? Do you miss anything?”\n\nEstelle Ballard set her suit case down on the walk and opened her hand bag. She made a pretense of counting the contents.\n\n“No. My money’s all here safe.” It was fifteen dollars instead of twenty-five, thanks to her generous, pitying impulse ; but it would be enough. Enough to —\n\nShe had not decided what she would do. She returned to the station, bought her paper, and went to a seat in the waiting room to open it. But the paper claimed small part of her attention.\n\n&amp;lt;h6 class=”btt&amp;gt;Back to Top&amp;lt;/h6&amp;gt;\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Chance, Anyway\n\nThat pickpocket, that mere boy — the boy whose mother had deserted when he was a mere baby! Just the age of her own; but she was leaving two, instead of one. If the mother had remained, perhaps the crippled young fellow would have turned out differently. He would have had a chance, anyway.\n\nNot that Tom Ballard was a “bum, a no-good;” far from it. But — a father is away from home too much to have enough influence on his children. And Tom’s aunt was all right in her way, too, but unaccustomed to youngsters. Perhaps she would not care to stay, but, whether she did or not, there was just one person whom the two children needed, and would always need. That person was herself, Estelle Ballard!\n\nThe things she had planned for herself in her new life of freedom suddenly seemed quite flat. Perhaps there had been more joy in the imagined foretaste than there would be in the reality. However that might be, she found her thoughts straying into other channels. She caught herself wondering if little Jim still had the faculty of somehow getting his shoes untied when he was out at play; if baby Gertrude still toddled after him in the same old way. She wondered if — but of course they did!\n\nIt was only a month that she had been away from them; what was it that made it seem so much longer? Of course they were the same, hadn’t changed any, or at least but a very little bit. Did they ask for her at night as they were tucked in bed ? Did they cry, as they used to do, every time she had planned to go out for the evening, until she had practically given up ever going out? They had tied her down so, but they had tied her with bonds which reached the heart.\n\nShe found herself on her feet, making her way to the information window; she heard herself asking, almost without volition, a question.\n\n“Connection for Sladeville? Only once a day, from here. Ten in the morning. You can’t get there before to-morrow, ma’am.”\n\nSladeville! It somehow didn’t seem quite so drab, after all, not when she thought of that crippled boy who had picked her hand bag. She still had enough money to get back — back home. But not, of course, if she had to pay a hotel bill to-night.\n\nShe bethought herself of Joe Burrows and Madge. Madge was an old schoolmate of hers. She could go and see them; no doubt they would invite her to stay the night. To insure that they would, she postponed her call until late in the day. The intervening time she spent at her almost forgotten lunch, and at a picture show. The pictures did not interest her greatly, somehow, though she had few opportunities of seeing any. Yet she felt a sense of restfulness, of satisfaction with the world. Was it because of her act of charity to the crippled youth at the station? Or was it because she was going home?\n\nShe found Joe and Madge, in the evening, at their three-room Commonwealth Avenue apartment. They were cordial enough, to all outward appearance; yet Estelle Ballard felt out of place with them. They were too urbane, too unreal — too bored, perhaps.\n\nJoe suggested a show, as if that were the only proper sort of entertainment which could be devised for a visitor. When Estelle admitted that she had spent the afternoon at one — without a thought that the movies might not be Joe’s idea of a show — her hosts hastily arranged to get a fourth hand for a game of bridge.\n\nAs the game almost silently progressed, Estelle Ballard could not help feeling that the rest of the party were probably as bored as she, herself, was. This was the sort of thing that she had dreamed of, yet it was unutterably flat and distasteful to her. The apartment was too precise, too gleamingly luxurious and orderly.\n\nThere were no scars on the chairs, no pencil marks on the wall paper. At home, now, every article of furniture had its own history, a history recorded in scratches and dents. And it was too unnaturally easy, too monotonous, to sit down after supper with nothing to do but amuse one’s self — no little ones to put to bed, to get drinks of water for. It was dull, that was it. Madge and Joe had never had any children; they had become accustomed to living for themselves only; they had become dull, too.\n\nSleep was a welcome relief to Estelle Ballard that night. The davenport in the living room was a fairly comfortable bed; and it was there that she slept. Her predominant feeling before sleep claimed her was a great loneliness; a single afternoon and night of the longed-for irresponsible life had been plenty for her, was driving her back gladly to take up the burden.\n\nIn the morning, after breakfast, she departed earlier than she needed to. With thanks for their hospitality, with invitations to come and visit her in Sladeville, invitations which she knew they would never accept, she departed. She went straight to the station; nothing in the city, nothing in the world, could tempt her interest now, in the prospect of her journey home.\n\nThe train was made up at last Estelle was one of the first to board it. She sat quiet, while the car gradually filled; sat with folded hands, gazing idly out the window. But her thoughts were far from the gleaming tracks, from the hurrying baggagemen who were rushing trucks about.\n\nShe was not shaken from her revery until a bump signified that the engine had been attached, and some one slipped into the seat beside her.\n\n“Estelle!” She looked around. It was Tom. “Estelle! You — did you come to Boston to look for me? You were to have been home yesterday — only I couldn’t make it to be there to meet you. I had to come — a business trip — “\n\n“Business?” asked the woman. She smiled at Tom and pressed his hand warmly. He was smiling back at her, affectionately, but proudly, too. She could read his face like a book; her years with him had taught her that. He had a secret of some sort, she knew; a secret which impatiently awaited utterance.\n\n“The head office of the company sent for me,” he announced. “The superintendent of the Sladeville mill is being transferred to a larger one; and I’m to have his job!”\n\n“Really!” Estelle did not need such news to make her happiness complete; she was going home, where she belonged; that was enough. Yet Tom’s advancement to a superintendency had — well, pleasing possibilities!\n\nHe forgot about pressing her for her reasons for being in the city. She was glad of that; he need never know. Even if he did, later, it would make no difference; she had learned her lesson, had made the right choice; he would never think the less of her for that.\n\nIt was only when the countryside, visible through the train windows, began to take on the familiar appearance of home surroundings that the new job exhausted itself as a conversational topic. Then Tom, with a laugh, pointed to an item in the city paper which he had held on his lap throughout the journey.\n\n“You know how old-fashioned Aunt Martha is, dear. Just before I started on the trip, she warned me, in that way of hers, to look out for pickpockets while I was in the city. According to this, her warning was not so ridiculous, after all.”\n\nEstelle Ballard leaned over and read the item.\n\n“‘Limpy’ Lannigan, notorious pickpocket and sneak thief, was arrested this morning in a down town subway station, after he had seized the purse of a seventeen-year-old salesgirl on her way to work. The girl’s presence of mind in following him to the street, after noticing her loss, coupled with the infirmity from which he gets his nickname, prevented his escape.\n\n“Lannigan is an old offender, and has done time on four occasions in the past. Aside from petty theft, his specialty is begging. In that role, with his twisted leg and the underfed air of dejected juvenility which he is able to assume, he has wheedled the charitable public of this and other cities out of large sums, in the past.\n\n“Lannigan looks to be about eighteen years old, although, from his prison record alone, he must own nearly twice that number of years. Arraigned in municipal court, he was held in default of bail for the grand jury.”\n\nShe passed the paper back.\n\n“I don’t care,” she said absently. “I’m glad anyway. It was worth it! Because it was that which showed me — “\n\n“What’s that?” asked Tom, mystified.\n\n“Never mind!” answered Estelle Ballard, laughingly. “Sladeville! Here we are! And — look! There’s your aunt, with the children, waiting for us!”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

There stood Mrs. Ada Headley, a neighbor, blood streaking her face, her clothing stained.\n\n”We’ve been held up by gangsters,” she sobbed. “They’ve kidnaped Bob.”\n\nAnd then she fainted.\n\nAfter carrying the badly-wounded woman to a couch, Cole made two telephone calls: to Greene County Memorial Hospital and to Sheriff Henry Flowers.\n\nJust before the sheriff arrived, Cole heard hurried footsteps outside his door. It was Bob Headley, who later told Sheriff Flowers the most puzzling story he had heard in many a day.\n\n”We, my wife and son, were returning from a visit to West Virginia,” began Bob Headley. “I stopped the car close to the barn when two men stepped out of the shadows and called ‘Hands up.’ “\n\nOne man had quickly stepped behind Headley and poked him in the back with a gun and Headley had handed over his wallet.\n\nThe other bandit was covering Mrs. Headley, standing a short distance from her husband. The son, John, was still in the car. Then, suddenly, without any warning, the second bandit began firing at Mrs. Headley.\n\nThe poor woman staggered and collapsed.\n\n”Get in the car,” the bandits ordered Headley.\n\nThe man, hands high up over his head, had to obey. Then the men saw the boy and told him to get out and go in the house. And they watched the boy until he was inside the door. ,\n\nHeadley, in the machine, was ordered to take the wheel while one of them kept him covered. He drove down the road a way, then the bandits ordered him out of the car. That was the last he had seen of them. He had waited until they were out of sight and hurried back. Seeing a light in the Cole house, he had hurried here.\n\nBoth men were masked, Headley told the sheriff. Both were middle-size, one larger than the other, rather shabbily dressed. He knew of no reason for the hold-up. He rarely carried large sums of money and he had had only a few dollars with him. Why he had been chosen for a victim, he could not see.\n\nAn alarm was sent out immediately for the Headley car. At the hospital Mrs. Headley was put on the operating table. There was one bullet in her jaw, three in her breast and another in her abdomen. In addition, there were fourteen punctures in her intestines, said Dr. Henry Scott.\n\n“It will be a miracle if she pulls through,” Dr. Scott told the sheriff.\n\nNot much could be done until daylight. Then Sheriff Flowers and his colleague, Deputy Sheriff Jack Ohndorf, started out on the hunt for the Headley machine.\n\nFortunately there had been practically no traffic on the road during the night and the tracks of the Headley car were still clear-cut. The bandits had traveled down toward Kuhntown and Nettle Hill as Headley had said.\n\nBut the tire treads stopped abruptly shortly after Headley had been put out of the machine. Now on foot Flowers and Ohndorf tried to find the explanation for the missing prints. And they soon located the Headley car, turned into a side road, Hoover Run Road, concealed from the main route by overhanging trees and thick bushes.\n\nOther tire marks showed the presence of another machine. And the explanation was obvious. The bandits had parked their car here. On their return from the hold-up, they abandoned the Headley car and stepped into their own.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nDetails of This Mysterious Affair\n\nTwo details in this mysterious affair stood out. According to Headley, and Mrs. Headley had backed up this detail before going on the operating table, the second bandit began firing at her after her husband had handed over his wallet.\n\nWhy? There was no reason for the shooting. Neither husband nor wife had offered any opposition.\n\nThen why kidnap Headley? They didn’t need him as a shield to protect them from the bullets of pursuers. No one else had been around. And why that mile ride in the Headley car? Were they afraid their own machine might be recognized? Were the bandits local people, known to the Headleys?\n\nThe watch for the Headley machine was called off. Had anyone seen another car, color and make unknown, on the road around eleven o’clock? Or noticed anything else suspicious during the night?\n\nConstable Ralph Lohr, who also runs a general store on Route 18, was closing up shortly after eleven when he heard a car racing down the road. He watched it. It was a gray sedan. This had been barely a half hour after the hold-up and the machine came from the direction of the Headley place. And for lack of a better clue, a call now went out for the gray sedan.\n\nThe sheriff hadn’t much hope of locating the machine. To his great surprise, however, it was found the next day abandoned in a field on the farm of George Bissert, just outside Waynesburg.\n\nThe sedan wasn’t Bissert’s. But its license plates quickly identified the owner. It belonged to a Mrs. Otis Cumberledge over at Nettle Hill, a community on a direct line from Pine Bank where the hold-up had taken place.\n\nMrs. Cumberledge was well-known, a widow with two children, having a hard time making a living since her husband’s death.\n\nShe hadn’t used the car the night before. It was usually left on a path that led from the road to her house. Evidently the bandits knew this custom and had simply taken her machine.\n\nThe rest of the day was spent by the men under Sheriff Flowers cruising along the roads in the neighborhood of Waynesburg, asking all who lived off it if they had seen the gray sedan. It hadn’t yet been identified as the machine used by the bandits but there was a chance it had been.\n\nThe returns were nil. But Deputy Sheriff Ohndorf, his keen eyes skimming over both sides of the road, noticed something unusual in a field off Route 18 close to Nettle Hill. Getting out of his car, he hurdled the fence for a better look.\n\nHis hunch was a good one. For here Ohndorf picked up two suits of clothing, one rather small, the other much larger.\n\nBut even more intriguing were the two masks underneath. The bandits had worn masks. Were these the clothes they had worn? And why had they discarded these garments and in an open field?\n\nIt didn’t make sense. Bandits wouldn’t take the time to change garments, especially within such a short time of the hold-up and so close to it. Their main interest would be in getting as far as possible from the scene.\n\nSheriff Flowers was by now convinced the shooting of Mrs. Headley was no ordinary hold-up. Nor were the persons involved ordinary bandits. There was something peculiar about the whole affair.\n\nGossip in a small community often provides an important clue. Sheriff Flowers now let it be known that he was interested in any chit-chat that involved either of the Headleys.\n\nOf Mrs. Headley he heard only the best. She was a devoted wife and mother. Of late, however, she had been much upset. Neighbors had seen her with red eyes, tearful. And local gossip credited her unhappiness to the roving eye of her husband. For that roving eye had lighted on a local widow and stayed there. And the widow was none other than Mrs. Cumberledge.\n\nA couple of years earlier, Bob Headley had been an employee of the Equitable Gas Company and this job brought him along Route 18, close to a gas station the Widow Cumberledge had opened across from her home after the death of her husband.\n\nHeadley often stopped here for a chat. The friendship ripened. The two were often seen together in the Headley machine. Mrs. Cumberledge’s family had disapproved; both her mother and sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Pettit, who lived with her, tried to persuade the widow to stop running around with Bob Headley.\n\nBut their arguments had not broken up the romance.\n\nSheriff Flowers now began to wonder if there was any tie-up between this thwarted affair and the surprise hold-up. That Mrs. Headley had been shot and not her husband puzzled him considerably.\n\nThe two suits of clothing abandoned by the bandits were worn and shabby. But the garments worn by one gave off an odor, earthy and personal. They had been worn recently, he was sure. And he hoped they might be recognized.\n\nHe began showing them to some youths of the neighborhood.\n\nOne lad, in his teens, admitted they looked familiar to him. After much persuasion, he added he thought he had seen them on Ellis Cumberledge, the widow’s fourteen-year-old son.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Tip and a Confession\n\nThat was enough of a tip. And the sheriff, in his car, headed straight for the Cumberledge home. Had the son, he mused, decided to take matters into his own hands and have it out with Bob Headley? Was the shooting of the wife an accident?\n\nHe found Mrs. Cumberledge and her sister together and came quickly to the point. He showed the mother the smaller suit of clothing. It had been identified as belonging to her son.\n\n”I’m going to take Ellis back with me,” he finished. “I think he’s tied up with this hold-up.”\n\nMrs. Cumberledge began to cry.\n\n“I can’t let you take Ellis,” she sobbed. “He knows nothing whatever.”\n\n”But you do?” interrupted the sheriff.\n\nThe woman nodded her head.\n\nIn a few minutes she told a story that was to shock the community for many a day.\n\n”We did it, Elizabeth and I,” said Mrs. Cumberledge quietly.\n\n”You two women?” ejaculated the astonished man.\n\nBob Headley had shown no inclination to divorce his wife and marry the widow. If his wife were dead, they reasoned, he might. And together they worked out the hold-up as a blind, planning to shoot the wife and thus clear the way.\n\nMrs. Pettit had donned Ellis Cumberledge’s worn suit; Mrs. Cumberledge had put on an old pair of trousers and coat belonging to her late husband. Then the two women drove to the Hoover Run Road, parked their own machine, and walked to the Headley farm to wait for the Headleys’ return from their trip to West Virginia.\n\n”Then you deliberately planned to kill Mrs. Headley?” demanded the astonished sheriff.\n\nBoth women nodded.\n\n”Which one of you fired at her?”\n\nMrs. Pettit spoke up. “I did,” she admitted.\n\nThen came an explanation which provides a sample of the amazing logic, or lack of it, by which some minds arrive at a conclusion.\n\n”My sister thought it wouldn’t be right for her to marry the man whose wife she had shot,” explained Mrs. Pettit. “So I said I would shoot her.”\n\nSo pretty and slim Elizabeth Pettit had taken on this task. They each had a pistol. But Mrs. Cumberledge’s had been only a toy. Lest Headley recognize her, she had stood in back of him, pressing her pistol into his back. But Elizabeth Pettit had deliberately aimed the old .22 caliber Iver-Johnson breakdown model revolver which had once belonged to Mrs. Cumberledge’s husband at Mrs. Headley and fired.\n\nBoth guns, thrown into a field on the way home, were recovered.\n\nMrs. Headley recovered. But the two women were held. And despite his denials, Bob Headley was also, the authorities concluded, involved.\n\nIn March, 1941, both Mrs. Cumber- ledge and her sister, Mrs. Pettit, were found guilty with the former getting a sentence of from two to six years, the latter, from two to four years.\n\nAnd the last week in April, a jury decided Bob Headley had known of the plot against his wife and found the husband guilty, sentencing him to a period of three and a half to seven years in prison.\n\nAnd Waynesburg, satisfied, relaxed.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  A Bold Coup\n  The Girl\n  An Odd Impatience\n  The Theft of the Necklace\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nA Bold Coup\n\nSome time in the golden afternoon of a perfect tropic day the Queen Ann weighed anchor and with a swaggering, carefree air steamed out of the harbor of the Piraeus, nose in the wind, pointed to the open sea.\n\nFrom a position on the starboard rail on the broad promenade deck, Captain Valentine, as he called himself, stared back at the far shore-line. With each sturdy pulsation of the ship’s powerful engines Athens grew smaller, more toylike in size and shape. A smile of something not unlike relief touched the thin lips oi the adventurer. A bold coup which concerned the office of the British Embassy, a window in the building, a new Terrington safe and an oxy-acetylene blow-pipe with water-rheostat had made it necessary he leave the city without delay.\n\nSo he packed his booty, English gold and silver coin, in the false bottom of one of his three kit bags and departed. And now he was safely aboard the Queen Ann, adrift on Aegean Seas, bound for Alexandria; any of the ports in the Grecian Archipelago where fancy might bid him to disembark.\n\nSome twelve days later the Queen Ann swung into the Western Harbor, finding an anchorage in the let of a great breakwater amongst a throng of Egyptian coasters, canal-boats, and the usual busy water-craft that ply both the harbor of Alexandria and the Mediterranean.\n\nAgain at the rail on the promenade deck, Captain Valentine regarded the city across the spread of waters. The customs officials had come and gone; there was nothing to prevent him going ashore when it was his pleasure.\n\nYet he idled at the rail, brooding eyes on the city.\n\nIn the gathering dusk, the light of Pharaohs hung like a silver star between earth and sky; to the east the Mohammedan quarter of the city, set squarely upon the peninsula that separates the harbor, was cloaked with purple draperies — over it a new moon, slender as the scimitar of a Turkish brigand, threw a wan reflection on the oil-stained waters.\n\nTo the south lay the city, baking in the breath of the forty-day khamsin sweeping down from the deserts.\n\nCaptain Valentine drew himself up, tapped the ashes from his pipe and turned to confront the purser.\n\n”Beg pardon, sir, but the last tender is just going ashore.”\n\nSome fifteen minutes later, curled up in the stern of the motorboat, the odor of the East keen in his nostrils, Captain Valentine watched the city as it sprang up to meet him. And again the old question presented itself.\n\nWhat lay ahead — mystery, adventure, the lure of the unknown — plunder?\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Girl\n\nIt was when he had pushed aside his demitasse, in the splendid grill of the Hotel Marina, that Captain Valentine first perceived the girl. She occupied a table set well back from the center aisle, under the sheltering arms of a royal palm. And she dined leisurely, now and again laughing merrily at something her companion was saying.\n\nIn his quick, trained glance Captain Valentine observed the beauty of her piquant face, the dusky languor of her eyes, the lustrous glint of hair that was neither gold nor red, but yet a blending of both, the scarlet of Japanese- rose lips and the unstudied grace and charm of a slim, beautifully made body, draped in some cool, thin, white silk.\n\nThe adventurer transferred his gaze to the man opposite her; a tall, handsome, well-made individual whose nervous fingers played with the stem of a champagne glass. The adventurer frowned slightly. The face of the man was familiar; so much so that he sat still and allowed memory to creep back into the corridors of Yesterday.\n\nAt once he remembered the deserter from the French Condemned Corps; the caravan route to Timbuctoo — Port Said and that same handsome face.\n\nThe man was one Armel Touchet, a French crook and associate of the Apaches of Paris, until the long arm of the Government had snatched him up and sent him to Africa.\n\nClipping the end carefully from a cigar, Captain Valentine struck a match, encountering the eyes of the man. He still frowned as the other looked casually away. Who was the girl? What her status that she should dine so openly with one who, if in Paris, would immediately be pounced upon and hustled off to prison?\n\nAnd Touchet himself? What was he doing here in Alexandria; what ill- omened quest was responsible for his presence — what crime did he contemplate?\n\nAs if to find an answer to his questions, Captain Valentine surveyed the other diners in the grill. A swarthy Egyptian prince with his staff officers; a Jewish merchant; a party of Greek youths and a very old French woman, be-wigged in the fashion of the Empire, with a maid who danced in constant attendance — all these the roving eye of Captain Valentine rested briefly upon but found no answer to the riddle of Touchet’s presence.\n\nTo a waiter who came to remove coffee-cup and finger-bowl, he spoke: “Can you tell me the name of the young lady in white — yonder?”\n\nThe waiter bowed, after a glance across the room.\n\n”But certainly,” he replied in French. “She is a Mademoiselle Bowen. The gentleman with her,” he added, “is a Monsieur Sasson from Algiers.”\n\nCaptain Valentine smiled a trifle.\n\n”Thank you. You are familiar with the elderly lady with the maid?”\n\nThe waiter lifted his brows.\n\n”Monsieur does not know her? Surely then monsieur is a stranger. She is Madame Regnier, the wealthy, who but yesterday only purchased the famous Necklace of the Pharaohs from Yestini, the jeweler! A half million dollars, it is said, was the price!”\n\nCaptain Valentine felt a thrill leap through him, he was perfectly familiar with the identity of Madame Regnier, the richest woman in France, as she was sometimes called. He was equally familiar with the marvelous emerald necklace that had been given the title of the Necklace of the Pharaohs, through the fact it had been discovered in an Egyptian tomb centuries old.\n\nThe smile bit deeper into the thin lips of the adventurer. It was not difficult now to link the presence of Touchet with Alexandria.\n\nLeaving the table after a time. Captain Valentine made his way out and into a spacious lobby, where buzzing electric fans sought to combat the sweltering heat of the early evening. Excitement like an intoxicating draught ran warm within his blood. The Necklace of the Pharaohs! Chance had not led him from Athens to Alexandria without fixed and definite purpose. Loot worth the ransom of a king! And, seeking it, a dangerous scoundrel who dined with a girl he himself meant to know before the night grew haggard!\n\nHe had kindled a cigarette when Touchet and the girl in white emerged from the grill. They parted after a minute of conversation, the girl stepping out through the hotel’s main entrance, the French crook turning to the elevators, where, after a minute, he swung about on his heel and crossed directly to the lounging adventurer.\n\n”We have met before, I believe,” Touchet said grimly. “Unless I am greatly mistaken, you are one who calls himself Captain Valentine.”\n\nThe adventurer flipped his cigarette.\n\n”And you,” he said coolly, “are Touchet, a deserter from the quarters of the French Condemned Corps of Biskra. When we last encountered you were engaged in the profession of plundering caravans. We also ran across each other at Port Said. There you — “\n\nTouchet thrust his face close to the one who eyed him indolently.\n\n”A warning, Monsieur the Captain,” he said, controlling his voice with an effort. “Alexandria is not large or comfortable enough to hold us both at the same time. You understand?”\n\nCaptain Valentine laughed pleasantly.\n\n”I understand you perfectly,” he replied carelessly. “But,” he murmured, turning away, “your words to me resemble only the sighing of a breeze.”\n\nWhen the elevator had engulfed the figure of the French crook, Captain Valentine made his way out of doors.\n\nOn the southerly side of the hotel were gloom-filled gardens. Had the girl taken one of its many paths? Moving forward through the dusk, Captain Valentine picked a way among the shrubbery. All was quiet save for the roaring of the khamsin overhead.\n\nFor a minute he thought the girl in white had stepped into Quick Street. Then, suddenly, as he was about to retrace his steps, he caught sight of a moving blur in the shrubbery.\n\nIn another minute he was at the girl’s side.\n\n”Your pardon, mademoiselle,” he said, employing a quiet, courteous tone. “Believe me to be no Don Juan when I crave a moment’s speech.”\n\nIn the darkness her eyes glowed.\n\n”What,” she inquired colorlessly, “is it you wish to say?”\n\nHe took a step toward her, thoughts flashing like drawn swords through his mind. Better, he decided, to come to the point at once without fencing.\n\n”I saw you at dinner in the grill,” he explained. “Your companion, a gentleman who calls himself Monsieur Sasson, I have reason to know is Touchet, a notorious French criminal. I thought you might be interested in knowing this — if you do not.”\n\nA long silence followed his words.\n\n”Thank you,” she said after a time. “It — it is very kind of you to interest yourself. And now if you will leave … I wish to think over what you have said.”\n\nBack in his hotel room Captain Valentine, some hours later, made ready to retire. He had ascertained that Touchet’s room was directly over his; that the apartments of Natalie Bowen (as the hotel register read) were somewhere on the floor below — that Madame Regnier’s luxurious suite was on the fifth floor, overlooking the gardens.\n\nHe went to his window and looked out. No balcony was before it; it was forty feet from the ground below.\n\nThe door of his room locked and a chair placed under its knob, Captain Valentine looked to the chambers of his service revolver before slipping it under his pillow.\n\nFor all of the weariness inspired by the heat, slumber was delinquent in arriving. His mind was filled with myriad thoughts of the Necklace of the Pharaohs, of the girl, Natalie Bowen, and of the meeting in the gardens. Had she been aware of Touchet’s identity? Was she an accomplice? Her voice had betrayed no emotion; it was impossible to reason, as slumber came at last, either one way or the other.\n\nIn all corners of the world Captain Valentine had slept, and under all conditions. Years of training, the training of necessity, had presented him with the gift of awakening at the slightest sound.\n\nThus it was that some time between midnight and dawn his eyes opened with a jerk and his hand crept under the pillow and gripped his revolver. Motionless and breathing heavily, he strained his ears.\n\nSilence for a time, save for inconsiderable night sounds — then a footfall not three feet distant from him; the glimmer of a knife as a bar of intruding moonlight fell full upon it.\n\nSweeping up the bedclothes with his left hand and gripping his revolver with his right, Captain Valentine launched himself at the muffled figure of his would-be assassin.\n\nThe sheets and unused blankets parried the flashing thrust of the knife. In another minute, dropping them and closing in, he had his fingers about the throat of his unbidden guest, with difficulty repressing the cry of astonishment that surged to his lips.\n\nThe throat his fingers dug into was the throat of a woman!\n\nShe fought with tigerish ferocity, but the combat was of short duration.\n\nCatching the arm that held the wildly stabbing dagger, the adventurer bent it double and forced her up against the wall. A groan fell from pain-twisted lips. He increased his pressure until a cycle of minutes sped past.\n\nThen the knife clattered to the floor and the woman fell limply into his arms.\n\nHolding her to him with an arm of steel, the adventurer reached for the light switch and snapped on the electricity. He found himself looking down into the face of the small maid he had perceived waiting upon Madame Regnier in the grill at dinner.\n\n”I will give you your choice,” he said, thrusting her off from him. “You will answer the questions I put to you, frankly and fully, or I will hand you over to the authorities on a charge of attempted murder! Take your choice.”\n\nThe girl, a pretty brunette, nursed her twisted arm, glaring at him.\n\n”Speak quickly!” Captain Valentine commanded.\n\n”I will answer you,” she said sullenly.\n\n”First, how did you get in here?” She indicated the window.\n\n”Down a rope.”\n\n”From the room of Monsieur Touchet?”\n\n”Yes; from the room of Monsieur Touchet.”\n\n”You are in his employ, of course. You were instructed to knife me?”\n\nA slow smile haunted her lips. “Oui.”\n\nCaptain Valentine twirled his revolver. He might have expected Touchet would not be tardy in striking.\n\n”Futile 1” he murmured. “Now for another question. Your gallant employer is planning to steal the necklace of the lady in whose employ I presume he placed you. I am interested to know in what manner the necklace is to be obtained. Tell me.”\n\nThe girl shook her dark head. “Never! You cannot make me. If you touch me again I will scream for assistance! When it comes I will say you enticed me into this room and attacked me! My word is as good as yours!”\n\nThe adventurer twirled his gun again, amused at her assurance.\n\n”No,” he differed pleasantly, “you will not do that for two reasons. One, that I will immediately lay before the authorities here in Alexandria a complete and authentic history of who Monsieur Touchet happens to be. I fancy the French Embassy will thank me for turning over a deserter. The other reason,” he went on placidly, “is that I will shoot you down without hesitation if you so much as open your mouth! Now will you tell me?”\n\nShe looked at him for a long minute.\n\n”I do not know much,” she said finally, with a shrug. “Monsieur intends to take the necklace at a supper party Madame is giving to-morrow evening. It is during the meal the emeralds are to be stolen. How or in what manner, I do not know. That is al …peak the truth.”\n\nCaptain Valentine pursed his lips.\n\n”One more question and .you may go. Who is Mademoiselle Natalie Bowen?”\n\nShe presented a blank face to him.\n\n”You refer to the young lady in white — Monsieur’s partner at dinner tonight? I do not know he …ever saw her until last Tuesday — the day I arrived from Paris with Madame.”\n\nCaptain Valentine walked to the door, unlocked it, drew the protecting chair away and looked into the corridor.\n\nWhen he saw it was deserted he motioned to the girl.\n\n”That is all. You may go!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nAn Odd Impatience\n\nWarily watchful through the following day, Captain Valentine saw nothing of the Bowen girl or of Touchet. Madame Regnier was in evidence during the early afternoon in the lounge room of the hostelry, the girl who had visited the adventurer the previous morning close beside her.\n\nCaptain Valentine felt, despite the absence of Natalie Bowen and the French crook, that several things were becoming clear to him. Since learning that Madame Regnier’s maid was a creature of Touchet’s, he had speculated as to why the maid had not herself lifted the emeralds. He found an answer to this when the day clerk at the hotel allowed the adventurer to artfully draw him out. The necklace, it appeared, was kept safe under lock and key in the vault of the hotel, beyond the grasp of reaching fingers.\n\nIn no small way satisfied by the in- • formation, Captain Valentine kept to the point and learned that the supper party the French woman was giving the same evening was to be held in one of the dining-rooms on the second floor, and that the guests invited included, besides Touchet and Natalie Bowen, several English port officials, their wives, and a wealthy Greek tobacco merchant.\n\nWhen the clerk mentioned the name of the girl in white the adventurer raised quizzical brows.\n\n”Mademoiselle Bowen? You mean, of course, the young lady in white? A very pretty and charming young person, indeed. I wonder who she is.”\n\nThe clerk, bursting with information, leaned confidentially forward.\n\n”Very pretty and charming,” he agreed enthusiastically, “and so young to travel alone. She has conic from London and is going to Bombay, so I understand, to join her father, an army major. Two more days,” he added, “and she will be gone.”\n\nAs the afternoon waned. Captain Valentine felt himself beset by an odd impatience. Before many more hours elapsed he must outwit Touchet and obtain the necklace. The affair of the British Embassy office in Athens must even now be in the hands of the secret agents; the menace creeping toward him with the slow but certain rapidity of a gathering monsoon. For him the long trail; never the luxury of rest at any one particular point — danger, like his own shadow, hung at his heels, driving him on and ever on. To linger in Alexandria might be fatal to all hopes of a future … .\n\nLearning the exact location of the private dining-room Madame Regnier had engaged, he made his way to the second floor and pushed open its unlatched door. Investigation proved it more than suited his purpose. It was a chamber of no great dimensions, yet one ample enough to accommodate a party of twelve or more. It contained a long center-table over which was suspended a low hanging chandelier.\n\nBut these things Captain Valentine considered last.\n\nHis quick eye focused on a small ante-chamber adjoining the room, at once a part of it but separated and shut off by heavy, woven-grass portieres, making the room a private place, used no doubt by waiters to store empty dishes or cool champagne.\n\nMaking sure the corridor in which he stood was free from spying eyes, Valentine admitted himself and crossed to the ante-chamber, drawing back the curtains. A smile sprang to his lips.\n\nIt could not have been better adapted to his purpose. A single, wide window protected by a wire mesh screen opened directly upon a narrow iron balcony that ran the length of the hotel.\n\nBack again in the lobby, where the twilight was seeping in from Quick Street outside, Captain Valentine caught sight of the girl who called herself Natalie Bowen. She stood in the doorway of the lounge room, her red- gold hair glimmering with fairy fire in the reflection of the recently kindled wall sconces, a proudly poised youthful figure, fascinating, almost unreal in the blue Egyptian twilight of the old gods.\n\nShe saw him even as he saw her, and came toward him.\n\n”May I speak with you — outside?”\n\nCaptain Valentine nodded, his gaze on her beautiful face.\n\n”I shall be honored.”\n\nThey made their way to the gardens where he had sought her the previous night.\n\n”I am so frightened,” she said, in a hushed voice. “ …m sure now you must be correct about Monsieur Sasson. I have done very wrong in accepting his hospitality, but I didn’t know. I met him on a Royal Mail steamer coming in from Algiers, and he told me he knew my father, was a friend of his. He seemed to be so certain — “\n\nShe halted, fingers twisting together.\n\n”If there is any service I can render,” Captain Valentine said earnestly, “please command me.”\n\nShe dropped a hand to his arm.\n\n”Oh, if you will! I could never thank you enough! This is my plan. I wish to go tonight without his knowledge … think I am afraid of him since you spoke. I have been invited to the supper party of a dear old lady … . Madame Regnier, but afterwards —  one of the coast steamers sails at two- thirty in the morning — he would never imagine I would take that — “\n\nCaptain Valentine fingered his chin.\n\n”You wish me to put you aboard her? An excellent idea. I shall consider myself fortunate that I may aid you if only in this small way. Please leave the matter of obtaining reservations entirely in my hands. I will see to it that a stateroom is had. And I will have a conveyance ready to pick you up at — “ he thought a minute … he side entrance of the hotel, to the east, at, say, fifteen minutes of two. If you can slip out by that exit no one, I am sure, will be the wiser.”\n\nShe drew closer to him and lifted her face to his. In the gloom, at that moment, she was very desirable and appealing. It was only with an effort that Captain Valentine resisted the temptation to take her in his arms.\n\n”Thank you,” she breathed. “I knew I would not need to ask in vain!”\n\nShortly before dinner the adventurer purchased an outside stateroom on the coast vessel the girl had mentioned.\n\nBack in his room at the hotel again, he became busy with his preparations for the impending work of the night that lay confronting him. Donning a serviceable tweed suit, he slung his revolver on its silken cradle under his left armpit, transferred the plunder in the false bottom of a kit bag to two money-belts about his waist, and consigned all of his luggage to one of the native boys employed at the hotel.\n\nFull instructions he voiced and, to make doubly sure there was no chance of mistake, had the youth repeat them three times before he was satisfied.\n\nAfter dinner in the grill — a meal consumed without sign of either Touchet or the girl — he idled away an hour in the lobby and then sought his room.\n\nRestless and impatient by turn, for he was never one cut out to play a waiting game, the adventurer paced the length of the rug underfoot, smoked countless cigarettes and let his mind throng with speculative fancies.\n\nAgain he asked himself if Natalie Bowen was as guiltless as she appeared; if she was, in reality, a tool of Touchet’s — as much so as his intruder of the previous morning. There had been minutes when he was certain she was merely a bright-faced English girl traveling to join a military father; other, moments when he was not so sure — when he was almost positive she was a pawn pushed about by the sensitive, cunning fingers of the French criminal.\n\nOnly the night in its passing might give him the answer to the riddle.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Theft of the Necklace\n\nAt midnight Captain Valentine extinguished the lights, closed the door of his room for the last time, and made his way down to the gardens.\n\nSkirting the bulk of the sprawling hotel, he arrived at length at its easterly termination — where the iron balcony that ran down and past the private dining-rooms had its beginning.\n\nIt was an inconsiderable feat for him to leap up, catch the lowest iron bar and draw himself up and onto the balcony proper. He did this without hesitation, keeping well to the shadows.\n\nIn no great space of time he crouched before the wire-mesh screen of the window of the ante-chamber to the room in which Madame Regnier was holding court — a room brilliant with light and noisy with gusty laughter.\n\nWith the utmost caution Captain Valentine removed the screen and lowered himself across the sill. On noiseless feet he stepped to the grass portieres  — this after first darting the beam of a pocket torch about and making sure no waiter lurked in the half gloom.\n\nHolding the curtains so they might betray no movement, the adventurer inserted an eye to their slit.\n\nIn the next room Madame Regnier sat at a table sparkling with glass and silver. She was at its head, wonderfully gowned. About her withered throat, like coals of living green fire, the splendid Necklace of the Pharaohs hung, each irradiant stone winking and glimmering in the glare of the chandelier.\n\nAt the woman’s right sat Natalie Bowen, beautiful in a simple evening frock that displayed her charms to the fullest. Opposite her was the rotund figure of a man whose profile bespoke Greek blood.\n\nTouchet, sleek and smiling in perfectly tailored evening clothes, occupied a place at the foot of the table: the remainder of the chairs were filled with people the adventurer had never before seen, nor, in any likelihood, would ever see again.\n\nSwitching his gaze from the face of Natalie Bowen to the green stones about the throat of Madame Regnier, he felt a slow fire begin to burn deep within him. A king’s ransom I With the necklace for his own he might return to London or Paris, buy an estate and settle down to the life of country gentleman. He could barter it for all those things he had never known — love, the joyous high notes in the serenade of life, luxurious ease and the freedom from the carking fear of the long, apprehending arm of the law!\n\nComposing himself to wait the next move in the drama unfolding on the stage before him, Valentine eyed the two swarthy waiters moving quietly about the table. Were they, too, in the employ of the French criminal? Now and then he saw one of the men exchange a secret glance with the handsome man at the end of the table.\n\nA long hour passed.\n\nAt half after the hour of one the supper showed signs of drawing to a conclusion. Cordials and liqueurs having made their appearance, conversation became general, then men consulting watches, the ladies pushing chairs hack.\n\nStiffly still behind the curtains, Valentine waited. It was a matter of minutes now before Touchet would strike; before the blow would fall … .\n\nIt came as the thought flickered through his mind.\n\nFrom the foot of the table Touchet caught the eye of the waiter who had exchanged the glances with him, half lifted his hand as if to brush back his hair.\n\nFollowed almost immediately a sharp, distinct click — absolute darkness as the chandelier was snuffed out!\n\nExclamations broke out, a babbling dissonance of voices laughing and inquiringly raised.\n\nThen a sharp scream in the voice of Madame Regnier:\n\n”My necklace!”\n\nBefore the echoes of her voice had merged in the rising confusion, the chandelier blossomed with light again, revealing the elderly French woman standing in her place, both hands pressed to her bare throat, eyes distended with fear and horror.\n\n”My necklace!” she screamed. “It has been stolen!”\n\nIn her excitement in the dark she had knocked over her glass of crème de menthe — the liqueur lay in a puddle on the white cloth, dripping over the table edge onto the skirt of the wonderful evening gown.\n\nAll present were standing. Touchet, unruffled, leaning a little forward.\n\n”Your necklace, Madame?” he said, as if perplexed. “Stolen? Have the doors locked then at once 1 Let no one leave until it is found!”\n\nA waiter sprang to the corridor door and turned the key.\n\nAs fie did so, the stout Greek opposite Natalie Bowen gave vent to a startled exclamation, staring fixedly down before him.\n\n”Your necklace 1 Behold — “\n\nLeaning forward he dipped a hand into the puddle of creme de menthe and lifted from it the emerald string, sticky, but still scintillating under their covering of the fluid, fire-eyes that glowed as they lay coiled in the hand of the Greek, open pendant drooping from between his fingers.\n\nThe tense silence was abruptly shattered by a universal sigh.\n\n”Oh, Mon Diou!” Madame Regnier wailed, catching up a napkin and seizing her necklace. “I thought I felt it cut away! And it fell — it was my own fault! Ah — may I beg you to excuse the accusation — I was overcome — “\n\nWaiting to hear no more, Captain Valentine, a coldness stealing into the heat within his blood, moved back to the window, stepped out of it, replaced the screen and traversed the balcony.\n\nDropping down from it where he had jumped up, he lowered himself to the ground and made his way rapidly to the side entrance of the hotel. The taxi he had engaged earlier in the evening chugged quietly some little distance from the small porte-cochère.\n\nWith a glance at the luminous dial of the watch strapped to his wrist, Captain Valentine spoke to the chauffeur and threw open the door.\n\nIt lacked fifteen minutes only of the hour of two.\n\nThe soft thud of a closing door whirled him around. A shape glided out of the darkness and the girl joined him, a cloak over her evening gown, a small leather bag in one hand.\n\n”You did not fail me, M’sieu,” she said almost gaily. “Come — let us hurry. I left him in the lobby — ”\n\nCaptain Valentine assisted her into the vehicle, jumped in beside her and dosed the door.\n\nThe cab rattled into Quick Street and turned toward the harbor.\n\n”You have my ticket?” the girl questioned. “Do please tell me how much I owe you — “\n\nTime, the adventurer felt, was precious. The thing must be done with without delay. Leaning close to her he dropped a hand to her arm.\n\n”I’ll trouble you,” he said in a voice as cold as polished steel, “for the necklace you stole from Madame Regnier!”\n\nShe fell back against the upholstery, gasping.\n\n”The — the necklace — “\n\nHe shook her arm impatiently.\n\n”The necklace you removed from the neck of Madame Regnier before you dropped the substitute Touchet supplied you with into the creme de menthe. The necklace Monsieur allowed you to retain so as to make the trail more baffling! Come — hand it over!”\n\nThe harbor loomed up, streaked with the lights of anchored shipping, like broken ribbons of many hues.\n\n”I think you are the devil himself!” the girl said, her voice quivering. “Ah, M’sieu, would you take it from me? True, I stole it — but — but failure to hand it over to Touchet means death  — for me!”\n\nShe inclined her head toward him, eyes dim with unshed tears.\n\nCaptain Valentine sensed the subtle fragrance of a delicate perfume that clung to her — an odor like incense.\n\n”Come!” he ordered roughly. “None of that! I’m as desperate as you or your charming partner in crime! The necklace, and at once! I should dislike intensely to use force — “\n\nWith a strangled sob she slipped a hand into an inner pocket of her cloak. It came out clutching the Necklace of the Pharaohs. The adventurer snatched it from her, dropped it into his coat pocket and opened the side door of the tonneau.\n\n”The ticket I purchased,” he said whimsically, “I will make no charge for. I intend using it myself. And so — adieu!”\n\nBefore the quay the taxi had wheeled up to stood the boy from the Hotel Marina, the adventurer’s luggage at his feet; beyond him the tender of the coast steamer waited …\n\nValentine’s last impression, as the craft put out into the harbor, was of the girl’s pale face, the eyes wet with unshed tears, the delicate perfume that seemed to follow him … unforgetful.\n\n~ The End ~\n\n"

He knew then, as he had never known before, that he was too old to remain the matinee idol he had been for years. And the knowledge that the murder of James Stephen would make him wealthy within a year brought him no comfort at the moment. For he knew that wealth could never make up for the adulation in which he had basked all of his life.\n\nHe used the touch-up pencil on the streaks of white in his thick main of hair, cursed suddenly and bitterly, and whirled to where his dresser stood white-faced and fearful.\n\n“This isn’t my pencil!” he barked savagely.\n\n“Look, Mr. Drexler,” the dresser said nervously, “I thought the number two pencil would give better color, make better stage!”\n\nCurtis Drexler slammed the pencil against the wall. “Who the hell cares what a young squirt like you thinks; get the hell out of here and don’t come back! I knew what made good stage before you were born!”\n\n“Yes, sir, Mr. Drexler; I’m sorry. Mr. Drexler!” the youth sidled through the door, closing it softly.\n\nThe actor grinned, stepped softly to the door and turned the key. Then he returned to the light-framed mirror, finished his make-up for the third and final act.\n\n“Five minutes, Mr. Drexler,” a voice called just outside the door, and light footsteps drifted down the hall.\n\nCurtis Drexler stood, opened the right-hand drawer of the dressing table, slipped the revolver into the side pocket of his tweed coat. His face was suddenly hard, and his eyes bleak and piercing, beneath the mask of grease paint.\n\nHe had to work fast now, for he had less than five minutes to commit a murder and make his stage appearance for the final act. He smiled a bit when he saw the automatic on the top of the table.\n\nHe used that gun in the play; and later, when the police investigated the shooting of the producer, he would casually offer it for examination in the ballistics laboratory. They would never know that he had brought a revolver with him this evening.\n\nHis eyes flicked to the clock above the mirror, and he felt his breath catch in his throat. He had less than four and one-half minutes left.\n\nHe unbolted the small door at the rear of the room, slipped through into the property tunnel, raced lithely toward the iron steps at the end.\n\nHis nerves crawled at the thought that some grip might spy him running down the dim hall.\n\nHe went up the iron steps swiftly but quietly, anxious now to finish what he had planned. The iron treads creaked and squealed a bit in protest, and he slowed so that there would be less noise.\n\nHe heard the dull murmur of the audience behind the balcony door at the first turn of the stairs, felt a dull glow of satisfaction. He knew what they were talking, could almost give their comments word for word. He had known for a week that the play would be a smash hit, and that knowledge had consolidated the vagrant plans he had nurtured in his mind for the past month.\n\nHe felt no animosity or hate against James Stephen; he was but an obstacle that had to be removed. With James Stephen’s death, his fifty per cent interest in the play would revert to Curtis Drexler by virtue of a clause in the contract that they had drawn up before casting the play.\n\nDrexler had written the drama three years before, but had been unable to find a backer. Then Stephen had put up most of the money necessary, for a fifty per cent interest. Drexler had retained twenty per cent, and the remaining interest had been sold to three men.\n\nBecause he and Stephen had known each other for twenty years, and to keep chisellers from gaining an interest in the play, the contract had been drawn so that the interest owned by either man reverted to the other in event one died during the play’s run.\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Decided Hit\n\nNow, with the play a decided hit, James Stephen had to die, so that when the run was over, Curtis Drexler would not have to end his life as a hundred matinee idols had before him.\n\nDrexler passed the balcony door, ran lightly up the remaining steps to the upper floor of the theater building. He cautiously opened the stairway door, made certain that no one was in the hall, then slipped through.\n\nHe huddled at the producer’s office door, listening intently for the sound of voices. Satisfied that the man was alone, he palmed the knob, carefully and quietly edged the panel open a crack.\n\nThe office was so tiny and cramped that the opening door almost touched the back of the chair in which Stephen was sitting. The producer was poring over a set of books, totally oblivious of the opening door, his white shirt gleaming in the dim light.\n\nCurtis Drexler lifted the revolver in a hand that was rock-steady, tightened his finger on the trigger. The gun blasted again and again in the stillness of the tiny room, the reverberations almost deafening. Six dark spots sprang into high relief on the whiteness of the producer’s back.\n\nJames Stephen came to his feet, his head turning toward the murderer, his face tight with agony and surprise. He tried to whirl, but his feet tangled, and he fell heavily to the cluttered floor.\n\nCurtis Drexler caught his breath in horrified excitement, jerked the door shut, raced the few feet down the hall to the panel that led to the property tunnel.\n\nHe fled down the steps, remembering the terror and agony in the man’s face, and he thought for a moment he would be ill. Then his face hardened and his eyes lost their look of fright. He turned the stair corner, took the last few steps in three leaps, scurried into the open door of the furnace room. He jerked open the door of the roaring furnace, tossed the murder weapon into the crackling flames.\n\nThen he whirled, dashed down the tunnel until he came to the small door of his dressing room. He locked the door behind him, sat breathlessly at the dressing table. He smiled tautly when he saw that he still had thirty seconds before his entrance. He touched at his makeup with a powder puff, caught up the automatic, and left the room.\n\n“Mr. Drexler?” his dresser said the moment be appeared from the dressing room.\n\n“Get to hell out of my sight!” The actor’s nerves were still so taut he almost struck the youth.\n\nAnd then he was on stage, coming in from the left, his resonant voice picking up his cue with the ease of long practice. He bowed slightly, acknowledging the muted applause of the audience, then played the part he had written for himself so many months before.\n\nHe spoke his lines with all of the skill he possessed, acting his part like an automaton that could do nothing less than excellent, but his mind was on those last hurried minutes before his entrance.\n\nHe could find no flaw that might trip him up. Should he be questioned about his footprints on the stairs, or his fingerprints scattered here and there in his hurry, he could almost laughingly explain that he had the run of the building since he was a co-producer. And should they make a nitrogen test of his hand, he had only to say that there would naturally be burned powder on his skin since he fired a gun during the play.\n\nNo, he could not find the slightest of flaws.\n\nChapter 3\n\nMen Gathered in the Wings\n\nHe was making his next to the last speech, when he saw the men gathered in the wings. He staggered a bit, recognizing them, regained his poise almost immediately. He felt the wild gust of laughter beating at his throat, but his voice was even and unhurried.\n\nHe made his fifteen-second exit, right center, caught at the frightened arm of his dresser. His voice was harsh and strained, with an undercurrent such as the youth had never heard.\n\n“You did it again, didn’t you?” he said, “You thought you’d prove that you know better staging than myself!”\n\nThe youth shrank back, tried to free his arm from the heavy hand.\n\nCurtis Drexler laughed aloud, shrugged tiredly.\n\n“Forget it, lad,” he said. “Maybe you’re right. My day has already passed.”\n\nHe heard his cue, stepped back upon the boards. He spoke then as he had never before in his career, giving each line the mocking cynical twist that it demanded, hearing none of it, conscious only of the shocked incredulous face of James Stephen who stood in the wings with three of the house detectives.\n\nHe took the automatic from his pocket, as the action demanded, laughed cynically as the actress flinched in simulated terror. He lined the gun on her, felt the mockery of his heart flooding his mind with regret because of the thing he had tried to do.\n\nHe looked once directly at the audience that sat so tensely, so breathlessly, in wait for the smashing climax. He heard the frightened cry of his dresser as he lifted the gun the youth had thought did not have the stage appeal of the blued revolver. He had known, when he saw James Stephen still alive, that the youth had switched the blanks and real bullets in the two guns with the intention of telling him before he took a gun on stage.\n\nHe lifted the squat automatic, as the action demanded, placed the muzzle squarely at his temple, and pulled the trigger.\n\nHe didn’t see the final curtain come swooping down, but he would have been gratified to have heard the smashing applause that echoed for minutes after his last appearance.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n"

Good-morning.”\n\nThe story which Hawke was shortly afterwards recounting to his assistant, Tommy Burke, concerned the salvage of a twenty-foot sailing boat from Yarthorpe Bay.\n\n“There was a rough, circular hole in the bottom of it, forward, underneath the decked-in locker,” remarked Hawke, “and this appeared to have been deliberately cut. It had been patched from the inside with a piece of tarpaulin, nailed down, and caulked with pitch — a very crude and foolish kind of repair.”\n\n“It was a pretty old boat, eh?” queried Tommy.\n\n“No. That’s the remarkable thing about it. The boat was brand new.”\n\n“Wasn’t the tarpaulin patch effective?”\n\n“It might have been had it been left intact, but it was split right across, as though somebody had put his heel through it.”\n\n“An accident?”\n\n“It wasn’t in a position where it could have been trodden on accidentally. As I say, it was inside the forward locker.”\n\n“Somebody must have accidentally dropped some sharp, heavy object on it.”\n\n“Perhaps. But now we come to the really odd side of the business. The bodies of two passengers were hauled to the surface. These were a man and a woman, and round the body of each was a circular lifebuoy.”\n\n“What? Then why didn’t they float?”\n\n”Because attached to each lifebuoy was a piece of rope connected to a fifty-six-pound weight, presumably used in the boat for ballast and anchorage.”\n\n“That’s a silly sort of thing to do with lifebuoys! By the way, is it usual to carry those things in small sailing boats?”\n\n“No. The life-saving jacket is more usual, since it occupies less space. These lifebuoys were a shade smaller than the usual ship’s lifebuoys, so that they fitted rather tightly about tho bodies.”\n\nHawke paused to light his pipe, at which he puffed reflectively for a space.\n\n”The dead man was Hector Morgan, a salesman,” he proceeded, “and the woman was Miss Isobel Duckworth, a millinery buyer. I understand that she was a handsome woman, of striking personality, with whom Morgan had been acquainted for several months.\n\n”Now, as Morgan insured his life less than a year ago, the suicide clause applies, and if he took his own life the claim is not payable. We are asked to ascertain whether it was suicide or accident.\n\n”If you support the accident argument,” went on Hawke, “you have to explain away the extraordinary circumstance of those weights being attached to the lifebuoys. And if you favour the suicide idea you have the equally difficult poser as to why lifebuoy’s were employed at all.\n\n”Naturally, therefore,” the detective continued,”we look to see if there could be a third explanation, having no contradictions and illogicalities in it.”\n\n”The third explanation, of course, would be that it was murder,” exclaimed Tommy. “Do you mean that either Morgan or the woman secretly tied those weights to the lifebuoys with the object of committing both suicide and murder?”\n\n”That is what was in my mind,” agreed Hawke.\n\n”In that case, our job is to find out which of them was the perpetrator and which the victim.”\n\n”Not likely to be easy, is it, eh?” remarked Hawke.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Poetic Estate Agent\n\nOn arrival at Yarthorpe. Hawke called on Mr. Pargeter, the manager of the Yarthorpe Boat-building Yard.\n\nMr Morgan, the boat-builder said, had called on him about three weeks previously and purchased the boat in which he had gone to his death, paying £175 in cash. He had berthed it in the harbour, and had since sailed it once or twice in the evenings. Mr Pargeter did not know Mr Morgan’s address, nor anything about him, apart from his making that particular transaction.\n\nAt the local police station Hawke inspected the odds and ends which had been taken from the salvaged boat’s locker. The only item which appeared to interest him was the discarded stub of a cheque-book.\n\nIt was of the type issued by the Southern Union Bank, but the counterfoils gave no clue as to the branch from which the book had been issued.\n\nOne of the entries was “Self — £175.”\n\n“That’s the price of the boat, Tommy,” Hawke pointed out to his assistant. “I wonder why he didn’t give the boat people a cheque instead of drawing cash?”\n\nSubsequent inquiries during that day yielded the bewildering information that neither Morgan nor Miss Duckworth had ever had an acccount with the Southern Union Bank.\n\nWith a view to getting information on her past life which might tend to show whether or not she was a potential suicide before her death, Hawke called on the employers of the late Miss Duckworth.\n\nThere, in a department-store at Westwick, some twenty miles from Yarthorpe, he learned of her friendship with a married man, a Mr. Mervyn Quintock.\n\nMention of his name always occasioned the hesitant half-smile and the doubtful exchange of glances, and the reason became apparent when Hawke met Quintock in the Westwick Golf Clubhouse.\n\nHawke was able to have a highly-confidential talk with liim in a corner of the deserted lounge.\n\n“She was like a magnet to me, a magnet, my dear fellow,” he said, when Hawke mentioned Miss Duckworth. “It was an affinity stronger than even I, a poet, would have thought possible.”\n\n“I understood,” said Hawke mildly, “that you were an estate agent.”\n\nMr. Quintock winced and clicked his tongue, but made no reply to Hawke’s statement.\n\nHe sighed, rose, and walked round his chair, before reverting to the subject of Miss Duckworth.\n\n“She was part of me, don’t you understand ! When she and I were near one another it was like the approach of positive and negative electrical elements!\n\n“But I am married, Mr Hawke. I am tied to another woman, and my soul was on the rack, for I realised I must do what was right. I must do the right thing, you see  —  the right thing … ”\n\nHis voice trailed off, and he was introspective for a moment.\n\n“The thought of breaking my vows, of — of ridding myself of my obligations,” he resumed presently, “was as intolerable to me as — as the thought of not being able to — to possess this other — to remain in communion with my affinity.\n\n“And now,” Quintock continued, “how do you imagine I felt in face of Miss Duckworth’s ultimatum?\n\n“‘It cannot go on like this,’ she said. “Another man has come into my life now.’ Another man!”\n\nQuintock shuddered.\n\n“The thought was utterly unbearable, but she was uncompromising. Either I left my wife and went away with Miss Duckworth or she would marry this — this other man!\n\n“I had to choose between going away with her and doing the right thing — the socially, humanely right thing.”\n\nHe walked restlessly to the window and stood staring out, his twitching hands clasped behind his back.\n\n“By the way,” said Hawke after .a time, “did you ever meet this man, Morgan?”\n\n“No,” answered Quintock in an almost inaudible voice.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Cheque-Book Clue\n\nHawke was presently talking to the club secretary in the latter’s office.\n\n“Oh, Quintock,” said that robust gentleman, looking nauseated. “Wait a minute. I must collect his sub. He said he was going to pay it to-day.”\n\nHe returned a moment later with a cheque-book.\n\n“Our tame Shelley has gone into a poetic coma,” he said, “and can’t be bothered with such sordid things. I had to take his cheque-book and fill it in myself.\n\n“His wife would have been a jolly sight better off,” he added presently, “if he’d left her. He never takes her about. Treats her like a doormat, and thinks it’s very decent of himself to grace the home with his presence.”\n\nOne of the club members whom Hawke afterwards met was a local doctor, who happened to be an old acquaintance.\n\nAt mention of Quintock, the doctor frowned.\n\n“He told me all about it,” he said, “and asked my advice. Perhaps I ought not to tell you this, Hawke, but I will. He aroused in my mind the conviction that he was toying with the idea of poisoning his wife. I became so certain that he was thinking on those lines when he spoke of his wife’s failing health that I spoke to him very bluntly about it.”\n\nAfter his interview with the doctor, the criminologist left the clubhouse, and having instructed Tommy to drive him as quickly as possible over to Yarthorpe, he remained very thoughtful during the run.\n\nWhen they returned from Yarthorpe, bringing Mr Pargeter with them, Quintock was leaving the clubhouse and making towards his car, which was parked on a piece of waste ground at the back of the professional’s hut.\n\n“Of course I know him,” said Pargeter when Hawke pointed Quintock out to him.\n\nThey had just alighted from the detective’s car, and were standing some thirty yards away from Quin took, who was not in a position to see them.\n\nThe boat-builder made his remark in astonishment, and turned a questioning gaze on Hawke.\n\n“I don’t understand,” he said. “Whose body was it that was pulled out of the bay?”\n\n“Morgan’s.”\n\n“But I tell you that’s Morgan over there.”\n\n“Yon mean,” said Hawke, “that he is the man who, calling himself Morgan, came to you and bought the boat.”\n\nPargeter nodded vigorously.\n\n“He certainly is.”\n\n“I fancy,” said Hawke as Quintock drove away, “we have enough information now to justify our putting the police on to him.”\n\nThey drove into the town, where they saw the man leaving the Southern Union Bank.\n\n“It was his use of a Southern Union cheque-book, which I saw in the clubhouse, that put the idea into my head,” remarked Hawke. “Perhaps we’d better keep track of him in case my interview with him should have persuaded him to leave the district.”\n\nThe occupants of Hawke’s car exchanged significant nods on noting Quintock’s start when, happening to turn, he saw Pargeter in the detective’s company.\n\nQuintock’s car snaked away through the traffic at a reckless speed, and Tommy had difficulty in keeping track of him.\n\nThe chase led into Yarthorpe, where Quintock again got well ahead.\n\nNear the docks of the busy little port they almost lost him. They were prevented from following for several exasperating minutes while a long line of goods trucks crawled slowly along the outer dock road.\n\nAfter a ten minutes’ search they found the car parked by a pile of merchandise on one of the jetties, but there was no sign of Quintock.\n\nPargeter had a pocket telescope, which he directed towards the open sea.\n\nTurning, he handed the powerful glass to Hawke, who saw the lone figure of the self-styled poet sitting in the stem of a motor launch, which was already a couple of miles from the shore.\n\n“He seems to have hired Joe Greenway’s speedboat,” remarked Pargeter.\n\n“I wonder if he means to try to escape along the coast,” said Hawke.\n\n“He appears to be heading straight out to sea. He’s taking a mighty long chance if he hopes to get picked up.”\n\n“It’s more likely a romantic form of suicide. It’s just about the style of thing with which I would credit him.”\n\n”Joe Greenway’s is a pretty fast boat,” said Pargeter, “but I’ve got one that’s got an extra knot or two.”\n\n#&amp;lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&amp;gt;Back to Top&amp;lt;/h6&amp;gt;\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Speedboat Chase\n\nHawke, his assistant, and Pargeter were presently gliding out of the harbour in a cabin cruiser three times larger than the one they were pursuing.\n\nThev had been following the smaller craft for nearly an hour; the sun had set and the light was fading out of the sky when Pargeter glanced anxiously at the fuel indicator, and expressed the opinion that they had better turn back.\n\nThey were now riding great mounds of swell, and it was difficult to keep the smaller craft in view.\n\n“He’s only a few yards ahead,” stated Hawke, who had been peering out through the gloom and the curtain of spray. “Hang on a little longer.”\n\nA moment later he shouted a warning to Pargeter.\n\n“Look out! He’s turned. He’s coming straight at us all out. He means mischief!”\n\nGlancing over the port side, Tommy saw the sharp prow of the small launch cutting its way over the top of an enormous roller.\n\nIts speed increased by the current, it raced down at them, and, had not Pargeter wrenched the wheel round in the nick of time, it would have cut the larger boat in two.\n\nThe passengers were flung to the floor and deluged with the huge quantities of water that were shipped by the manoeuvre.\n\nThe light was now failing very rapidly, and, whilst bailing feverishly, they had to keep a look-out on all quarters.\n\nPresently there was a shout from Tommy, “Here he comes.”\n\nThis time Quintock was charging from the starboard side.\n\nHawke had determined on his course of action, and as Pargeter swung about once more, be sprang for the boat that came shooting by.\n\nHe caught its gunwale, and, in the same instant, realised that he was in imminent danger of having his head crushed between the two boats.\n\nHis shoulders were painfully scraped, and, for a second, he found himself in the churning, foaming water within an inch or so of the cabin cruiser’s whirling propeller.\n\nHe felt his fingers slipping slightly as the small launch roared on its way, but he contrived somehow to hang on, with his body bouncing over the surface of a sea which seemed to have become solid.\n\nIn such circumstances he could not have pulled himself into the boat, and would eventually have been compelled to let go had he not been literally thrown in.\n\nQuintock, who was not aware of his presence, had turned again sharply, and this brought Hawke’s body hurtling up over the side.\n\nHandicapped by the bouncing of the boat and his own exhaustion, Hawke found it impossible to drag Quintock away from the tiller. At the same time he was aware of the close proximity of Pargeter’s boat.\n\nWith the shouts of Pargeter and Tommy in his ears he made a supreme effort and threw his whole weight on the man. They were flung heavily against the side of the boat, and there was a loud scraping sound as the small launch struck the big one a glancing blow.\n\nThe small craft overturned, and Hawke had the horrible sensation of being trapped beneath it. But only for a moment. The pressure of the air thrust it on its side before it sank.\n\nA moment later he was dragged aboard the cabin cruiser by Pargeter and Tommy. Whilst he lay there in a dazed and semi-conscious state he heard Pargeter say:\n\n“I’m afraid he’s in a bad way. I’ve seen enough cases to know the signs.”\n\nHe opened his eyes, to discover that they were talking about Quintock, to whom they were applying artificial respiration.\n\nWhen eventually, with their petrol supply almost exhausted, they reached harbour, it was quickly established that Quintock was dead.\n\nHawke later recounted his story to the local police superintendent.\n\n“Remarks Quintock made to a doctor friend of mine,” he concluded, “tend to show that he was toying with the idea of murdering his wife, but he decided that that was not the right thing to do. He was terribly anxious to solve his love problem in the right way — so he murdered the other woman! It is quite easy to imagine how he lured her and her new boy friend out for a night trip in his specially-prepared murder boat, and hustled them into the fatal lifebuoys when the boat foundered, afterwards swimming ashore himself, possibly with the aid of a cork jacket.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Peter Peck\n\n&quot;There&#39;s a guy outside wants to see you, Chief,&quot; Charlie Ward&#39;s assistant announced through the door.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s he want, Joe?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know. Says his business is confidential and urgent. Wouldn&#39;t say what. Looks harmless though, in spite of he drove up in a Rolls Royce with a chauffeur.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, send him in.&quot;\n\nWard busied himself with a sheaf of morning mail and miscellaneous police circulars. Presently a small, immaculate looking individual with an apologetic, breathless air entered the room and approached the desk timidly. Silently, without even so much as a nod, he laid a newspaper clipping before the Chief of Police. Adjusting his glasses, Ward reached for the item and glanced through it hastily:\n\nMAN KILLED AT EL GATOS GRADE CROSSING\nEl Gatos, November 1.\nThe decapitated body of a man tentatively identified as J. Peter Peck, address unknown, was discovered by a company track walker early this morning on the South West Pacific grade crossing half a mile south of the town of El Gatos. Local police believe that the man was killed some time after midnight, possibly by the San Francisco milk train. Identification was established by a wallet containing papers of the deceased.\n\nWard laid the clipping on his desk, rolled a bulbous wad of chewing tobacco into one cheek and expelled it into a spittoon some ten feet away with a resounding plunk. Wiping his chin inexpertly with the back of a grizzled hand, he looked up and eyed his visitor interrogatively.\n\n&quot;I clipped it from last night&#39;s San Francisco Bulletin,&quot; the latter explained quietly. &quot;I drove practically all night so as to be here this morning.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re a relative?&quot;\n\nThe stranger smiled weakly and placed a pair of painfully thin hands on the desk as though to steady himself.\n\n&quot;Well, no, not exactly; that is, somewhat,&quot; he answered obscurely.\n\nCharlie Ward eyed the little man curiously.\n\n&quot;Come again, please?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, it&#39;s this way,&quot; slipping nervously to the very edge of a convenient chair. &quot;There appears to have been a slight error made. The clipping is somewhat inaccurate.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure. Half the stuff you see in the papers these days is cockeyed. Them guys never get anything straight. I always tell my wife you gotta believe only ten per cent of what you read and doubt that.&quot;\n\nThe stranger smiled thinly.\n\n&quot;Precisely. Now the real truth of the matter in this particular case is that I happen to be J. Peter Peck and, to the best of my knowledge, I&#39;m not dead. In fact I&#39;d take issue with anyone who questioned the fact. I therefore feel that the report has been exaggerated; just a tiny bit, at least.&quot;\n\nHe paused for breath.\n\n&quot;I thought you&#39;d like to know.&quot;\n\nWard arched his brows and smiled calmly. As a veteran police officer, he was used to surprises.\n\n&quot;Well, now that&#39;s one for the book, ain&#39;t it?&quot;\n\n&quot;Rather.&quot;\n\n&quot;So, if you&#39;re the guy that&#39;s supposed to be downstairs on ice,&quot; Ward supplemented, fumbling in a drawer of his desk, &quot;how come we find this here wallet with your name all over the papers inside on him?&quot;\n\nMr. Peck glanced at the wallet.\n\n&quot;Very easily explained,&quot; he answered. &quot;I was held up last Monday evening in San Francisco. The wallet and the papers it contains were among the things taken from me. Incidentally, there were several thousands of dollars in the wallet when I last saw it.&quot;\n\nWard whistled softly.\n\n&quot;How much?&quot;\n\n&quot;About twenty-four hundred dollars.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s a lot of dollars.&quot;\n\n&quot;It would keep a man in cigars for a day or two.&quot;\n\n&quot;And this guy, after he stuck you up,&quot; Ward reasoned, &quot;left Frisco and come North where he had the bad luck to meet with an accident.&quot;\n\n&quot;Precisely.&quot;\n\n&quot;What&#39;d he look like?&quot;\n\n&quot;There were two of them. One had red hair and his left ear was missing. The other was short; about my size, I would say; rather thin, with a small, black, straggly mustache and swarthy skin. I should judge he were either an Italian or possibly a Spaniard.&quot;\n\n&quot;The second one fits the guy on ice. Want to take a squint at him?&quot;\n\nMr. Peck jumped to his feet.\n\n&quot;I&#39;d be delighted,&quot; he said with what sounded to Charlie Ward like unwarranted glee.\n\nWard picked up a flask of corn whiskey and slipped it into his hip pocket.\n\n&quot;I warn you,&quot; he cautioned as he rose, &quot;this guy&#39;s pretty much worked over in spots. A train went through him you know. Some people get goose pimples looking at them kind of things.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll risk it.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Red Blotches\n\nThe pair left the office and descended a flight of steps. At the end of a dark corridor, Ward led the way into a basement room. Upon one of two marble slabs in the center of the room, lay a sheeted corpse. Ward palled the shroud back, revealing a horribly mangled body. Mr. Peck leaned over the corpse, revealing none of the repulsion that Ward was sure he would exhibit.\n\n&quot;Yes, that&#39;s unquestionably one of the men who held me up,&quot; the little man said quietly.\n\n&quot;I&#39;d know that face anywhere; what there is left of it. Er — seems to be quite dead, doesn&#39;t he?&quot; he added wryly.\n\n&quot;Quite,&quot; Ward mimicked, wondering at the same time what strange complex could cause a man of Mr. Pick&#39;s evident refinement and good breeding to jest under such circumstances.\n\nThe little man leaned over the corpse again.\n\n&quot;Odd marks on his face, aren&#39;t they?&quot; he observed.\n\n&quot;Huh?&quot; Ward seemed startled.\n\n&quot;I said those were odd marks on his face,&quot; Mr. Peck repeated.\n\nWard&#39;s face clouded and he stepped closer to Mr. Peck.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s funny you should notice them red blotches, Mr. Peck,&quot; he said. &quot;I been kind of wondering about them myself.&quot;\n\nThe two men eyed one another for a moment of tense silence, and marked suspicion.\n\n&quot;Why?&quot; Mr. Peck asked abruptly.\n\nWard scanned the little man&#39;s face with an air of uncertainty.\n\n&quot;Er — do them marks mean anything to you ?&quot; he finally asked, his voice tinged with caution.\n\nMr. Peck made no immediate answer, but turned and leaned closer to the corpse, examining the faint red blotches on the cheeks with more care than he had at first taken.\n\n&quot;To the casual observer, that is, to the layman,&quot; he said, removing his glasses and facing Ward, &quot;it might appear that the deceased was suffering from a mild case of measles&quot; — he paused, glanced at the corpse again, then turned once more to Ward — &quot;but to the trained eye, I would say that this man has received a shot of xctholine caniopus into his system.&quot;\n\n&quot;A shot of what?&quot;\n\n&quot;The name means little. Xetholine caniopus is a drug; not rare, not common, but violently poisonous. Contact, even to the lips or to a flesh abrasion will bring about practically instantaneous paralysis of the cardia.&quot;\n\nThe little man blinked.\n\n&quot;Er — the heart, I refer to. Xetholine invariably leaves its mark, as you perceive, in the form of faint red blotches on the cheeks.&quot;\n\nHe thumbed in the direction of the corpse.\n\n&quot;Putting the diagnosis into simpler words, this man has been poisoned. He died from the effects of the poison as is indicated by the slight carmine tinge to the blood. The effect of this poison on the blood stream is similar to that caused by asphyxiation by coal gas or a similar substance, only not quite so brilliantly red. If this man had died as a direct result of injuries received by the train passing over his body, the blood would be darker, almost purple. Offhand, I would say that the train passed over his body some several hours after his death. Depending upon the determination as to whether the poison was self-administered or otherwise, will settle the question as to whether you have a suicide or a murder case on your hands.&quot;\n\nWard stared into the little man&#39;s eyes in astonishment.\n\n&quot;Say,&quot; he interrupted, &quot;who are you, anyhow?&quot;\n\nMr. Peck smiled benevolently.\n\n&quot;My name,&quot; he explained, &quot;you already know. I happen to be deeply interested in criminology. It&#39;s been an avocation of mine for many years. My specialty is toxicology.&quot;\n\n&quot;Tox — tox. … ?&quot;\n\n&quot;Toxicology; the study of poisons. The circumstances of this particular case are unusually close to home and I feel a personal interest.&quot;\n\nHe paused and peered into Ward&#39;s face hesitantly and then added in a voice that half pleaded and half apologized.\n\n&quot;I — could I — would you allow me to — er — work with you in this matter, Mr. Ward? I&#39;d expect no pay, of course,&quot; he hastened to add, &quot;and I can assure you that my efforts will be sincere and my intentions entirely honorable. My only interest is in clearing up the matter, or at least attempting to do so, for the — well — the fun of doing it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Some fun, all right,&quot; Ward observed wryly. &quot;But, at that price, the County can&#39;t lose much. You&#39;re hired.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; Mr. Peck enthused, his eyes shining brilliantly. He rubbed his alms together briskly. &quot;I can&#39;t tell you how deeply grateful I really am.&quot;\n\n&quot;Okay, Mr. Peck,&quot; with a shade of doubt. &quot;It&#39;s your funeral. The paper says so.&quot;\n\n&quot;Now first, I must make a test to satisfy myself that xetholine caniopus was the actual cause of death. There are a few things I&#39;ll need; a glass, an ordinary water glass will do, a small quantity of commercial alcohol and a bit of lime water. My chauffeur will get the latter two, if you&#39;ll supply the glass. Please notify him.&quot;\n\nWard hesitated, as though doubtful about leaving this unusual person alone in the morgue, but finally assented.\n\nA few minutes later he reappeared with the glass, followed almost directly by the chauffeur with the alcohol and lime water.\n\n&quot;Thank you, Christian,&quot; Mr. Peck said in the chauffeur&#39;s direction. &quot;You may wait in the car.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Law of Averages\n\nWard&#39;s eyes followed the chauffeur as he left the room.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s a big guy all right,&quot; he observed, thumbing toward the vanishing driver. &quot;Sure must have et his mush every morning when he was a little boy. Looks like he&#39;s about six foot six.&quot;\n\n&quot;Six, six and one-eighth in his stocking feet, to be exact,&quot; Mr. Peck corrected. &quot;Before meals he weighs two eighty-eight; after meals two ninety-eight.&quot;\n\n&quot;Wouldn&#39;t want to run into him on a dark night.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hardly,&quot; Mr. Peck agreed. &quot;When he first came to me, he applied for the position which he now holds under the name of Mike Dennis and explained that he generally answered to the intimate and thoroughly quaint cognomen of &#39;Butch.&#39; But I changed that to Christian. Of course &#39;Butch&#39; is more in keeping, but I do believe that Christian adds to his dignity in spite of his ears. Don&#39;t you think so?&quot;\n\nWard grunted vaguely.\n\n&quot;I have it on good authority that he put Mr. Dempsey to sleep one evening about fifteen years ago in an amateur boxing meet.&quot;\n\nMr. Peck&#39;s eyes sparkled as he glanced up from his work for a moment.\n\n&quot;Unfortunately, I happen to be worth several million dollars. There have been two attempts to abduct me. Christian makes an excellent body guard as well as chauffeur. Not much intellect, but most conscientious and as faithful as an old watch dog. I&#39;ve had him with me twenty-two months now and to date he&#39;s uttered not more than twenty-two words; except, of course, when I speak with him. A handy person to have about; most handy.&quot;\n\nBy now Mr. Peck had sterilized the glass with the alcohol and was prepared to make his test.\n\n&quot;In the glass,&quot; he explained, holding the object toward the light, &quot;I have poured some lime water. By blowing one&#39;s breath into the liquid, through a common cigarette holder, the lime water becomes a milky white; thusly,&quot; and he suited the action to the word.\n\n&quot;The balance of the test is quite simple. Several drops of the deceased&#39;s coagulated blood are now added to the water. As you see, there is no change. In a moment, I will add a little alcohol. If the lime water clears and becomes colorless again, and shows indication of a volatile oil on the surface, you may rest assured that xetholine caniopus exists in the blood stream. Although the test is simple, the chemical reaction is rather involved, being a combination and then a dissemination of structural heraetixae and third power phincus. I shall not, therefore, bother you with its details. Suffice to say, the test is infallible and conclusive.&quot;\n\nWard scratched his head in hopeless perplexity and stared in mild anticipation mingled with a great deal of skepticism as Mr. Peck poured a small quantity of alcohol into the glass. Immediately, the liquid became pure and colorless and the surface indicated a distinctly oily film.\n\n&quot;All of which bears me out,&quot; Mr. PecK said quietly, placing the glass on the table. &quot;This man has been poisoned. Our next step is to determine whether the poison was self administered or otherwise. We … &quot;\n\n&quot;Just a minute, Mr. Peck,&quot; Ward interrupted, raising his hand. &quot;There&#39;s a couple of things here I ought to explain.&quot;\n\nWard floundered for a moment of hesitancy.\n\n&quot;You see, it&#39;s this way. For about twenty years, now, about twelve people a year have died in this here town; one a month; that&#39;s the average.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes; yes?&quot; Mr. Peck interjected interestedly.\n\n&quot;But in the last month, eleven people have turned in their rain checks. This guy&#39;s the twelfth.&quot;\n\n&quot;Which more or less upsets the law of averages.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s just what I&#39;m getting at. But what&#39;s worse, is that ten out of these twelve met with deaths from accidents of one kind or another.&quot;\n\n&quot;Just how do you mean?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, this guy, for instance,&quot; motioning toward the slab, &quot;was bumped by a train. The rest met with other accidents ranging all the way from hit and run, down the line to falling off hay lofts and being kicked in the head by a mule. Nobody seen any of the accidents, but the evidence was such that you couldn&#39;t help see what happened. For instance, the guy that was kicked by a mule, he had a hoof mark on his head and his mule had a bloody hoof. The hit-run guy, we found in the middle of the highway.&quot;\n\n&quot;Coincidence. Accidents almost invariably occur in threes or fours.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure; threes and fours, but not tens and twelves. But there&#39;s something else.&quot;\n\n&quot;… yes?&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nOld Doc Kraus\n\nCharlie Ward moved a little closer and glanced behind him as he spoke.\n\n&quot;Of the ten who met with accidents,&quot; he said, &quot;nine had these red marks on their cheeks.&quot;\n\n&quot;Excellent! Gorgeous!&quot; Mr. Peck enthused through grinning lips. &quot;A multiple murder! Nothing could be clearer or more fortunate!&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, you may be tickled, Mr. Peck, but I ain&#39;t. Several of the victims were close friends of mine.&quot;\n\nMr. Peck&#39;s attitude changed at once.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m deeply sorry, Mr. Ward,&quot; he apologized. &quot;My enthusiasm carried me away for the moment. Please proceed.&quot;\n\nWard nodded and went on.\n\n&quot;At first I didn&#39;t think very much about these blotches, but when this guy was brought in this morning, I began to get kind of nervous. As a matter of fact, I was just going to phone Frisco for help when you come in.&quot;\n\nMr. Peck nodded and smacked his lips thoughtfully. He removed his glasses and wiped them slowly and carefully, polishing each lens with meticulous care.\n\n&quot;You of course have a coroner or medical examiner of some kind,&quot; he finally said.\n\n&quot;Oh, sure. Old Doc Kraus handles the cases for the whole county when they come up. There ain&#39;t enough to keep him on full time, but we send for him whenever we need him. He makes the examination and runs the inquest.&quot;\n\n&quot;What did he think about the red blotches on the faces of the nine corpses?&quot;\n\n&quot;Nothing. To tell you the truth I never thought enough about them to bring it up.\n\n&quot;And he&#39;s never mentioned it to you.&quot;\n\n&quot;No.&quot;\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t possibly conceive of anyone missing them.&quot;\n\n&quot;The Doc&#39;s getting pretty old,&quot; Ward explained. &quot;He don&#39;t see so good. We been trying to get a younger saw-bones for a long time, but nobody had the guts to tell him he was fired, I guess. He was born here; lived here for seventy-two years. He&#39;s a nice enough old guy. Matter of fact, everybody sort of looks up to him as the town granddad. He&#39;s a kindly old duffer; always doing things for folks and going out of his way to help a neighbor and things like that. I&#39;ll send for him and ask him if he noticed the marks and what he thinks about them.&quot;\n\n&quot;No, I&#39;d prefer it if you didn&#39;t. For the present, let&#39;s work quietly. As far as I&#39;m concerned, everybody&#39;s under suspicion and any word getting out that we&#39;re working on the case might spoil things.&quot;\n\n&quot;Old Doc Kraus under suspicion!&quot; Ward scoffed with a loud guffaw.\n\n&quot;Say, that&#39;s rich. Why, I&#39;d trust him ahead of my own Dad and that&#39;s saying a lot. Why he brought me into this world forty-two years ago. Used to spank me when I was a kid and needed one. Why … &quot;\n\n&quot;I did not say I suspected Doctor Kraus,&quot; Mr. Peck interrupted. &quot;I merely inferred that everybody was under suspicion until we begin to find something definite to go on. The reasons, I believe, are obvious.&quot;\n\n&quot;I get you Mr. Peck.&quot;\n\n&quot;Now then, the inquest has been performed in this last case?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes; early this morning; just before you got here. They handed down a verdict of accidental death.&quot;\n\n&quot;Have you made any attempts to identify the corpse?&quot;\n\n&quot;Certainly. We figured it was you on account of the papers. We been trying to trace you through the Frisco police. So far no information has come in.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s quite possible. I lead a very quiet life; live at a bachelor club and am not listed either in the phone book or the City Directory.&quot;\n\n&quot;I sent finger prints to the Frisco Police. If this guy&#39;s got a record, we&#39;ll know who he is pretty quick.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s fine.&quot;\n\nMr. Peck stood for a moment with a thoughtful finger to his lips.\n\n&quot;I think we&#39;ll visit the spot where the body was discovered,&quot; he decided abruptly. &quot;We can go in my car.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nAt the Scene of the Crime\n\nTen minutes later, J. Peter Peck, accompanied by Charlie Ward and followed by Christian, stepped from the machine at a point opposite the spot where the body had been found.\n\n&quot;A machine has stopped here at the side of the road quite recently,&quot; Mr. Peck offered, pointing to the tire marks in the dust. &quot;The occupant, as is indicated by those very clear foot prints, stepped from the car, crossed the ditch and walked to the railroad tracks. He was a heavy man, at that, or at least he has big feet. And they turn out more than the feet of the average person.&quot;\n\nCharlie Ward nodded agreement.\n\n&quot;Now if you&#39;ll look closely,&quot; Mr. Peck went on, &quot;you will observe that there are two sets of foot prints; one coming and one going. The return prints, significantly, are not as clear as those that go to the tracks, indicating that he was carrying a load to the tracks, but did not return with it.&quot;\n\nHe glanced at Ward for a moment, then added, &quot;It is pretty obvious what that load was. All of which gives us practically undeniable proof that a murder was committed. The deceased died of poison. We have definitely established that point. And his body was placed upon the tracks to conceal the fact; or to attempt to do so. If the deceased had walked to the tracks himself, which of course he didn&#39;t because these are not his foot prints, there obviously would be no return prints. Dead men, especially decapitated dead men, seldom, if ever, retrace their steps.&quot;\n\nHe paused for a moment of conjecture.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll take plaster casts of the foot prints as well as the tire marks. Will you attend to that Christian ? I believe you&#39;ll find sufficient plaster of Paris in the tool compartment.&quot;\n\nChristian set to work and Mr. Peck and Ward retreated to the machine. When Christian had completed his work, the trio returned to headquarters, Mr. Peck leaving again to &quot;do a little thinking.&quot;\n\nTwo hours later, Mr. Peck entered Charlie Ward&#39;s office again and eased himself into a chair.\n\n&quot;I have an idea,&quot; he informed Ward, &quot;that the apprehension of the murderer is but a matter of moments. As a matter of fact, I can put my finger on him in ten minutes should I care to.&quot;\n\n&quot;You can put your finger on him right this minute if you want to,&quot; Ward supplemented, taking his feet off the desk and flipping a cigarette butt through the window.\n\n&quot;How so?&quot;\n\nWard unlocked a drawer in his desk and drew out a tin box from which he produced a thickly padded envelope.\n\n&quot;I been doing a little scientific snooping myself,&quot; he announced with a proud ear to ear grin.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s extremely gratifying.&quot;\n\nWard thumbed toward a cigar butt in an ash tray.\n\n&quot;That,&quot; he said, &quot;is what&#39;s left of a cigar you give me this morning. It gives off a pretty thick aroma.&quot;\n\n&quot;It ought to. They cost me a dollar each.&quot;\n\n&quot;Just take a whiff of this,&quot; Ward said, handing the envelope to Mr. Peck.\n\nThe latter smelled cautiously. &quot;Why, it smells like my cigars.&quot;\n\n&quot;Exactly. Now take a squint in the envelope.&quot;\n\nMr. Peck opened the envelope and extracted a shear of currency.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s about twenty-four grand there,&quot; Ward offered.\n\n&quot;All of which is mine. It&#39;s the money that was taken from me when I was held up. I had the wallet and several of the cigars in the same pocket. The currency evidently became impregnated with the odor of the cigars. Where did you get it?&quot;\n\nWard shuffled leisurely through some papers, finally producing a telegram.\n\n&quot;This wire,&quot; he said, flourishing the message with an extravagant gesture, &quot;come in from the Frisco police while you were out. It says the guy downstairs on ice is Dominic Diaz. He was a guest at San Quentin up to four days ago where he was serving ten to fifty years for some mistakes he made when he was younger.&quot;\n\nMr. Peck nodded interestedly.\n\n&quot;It also says that when he so rudely walked off the premises without stopping to say goodbye, he was with a red headed monkey, minus one ear, that answers to the name of Mike McSweeney.&quot;\n\n&quot;I see.&quot;\n\n&quot;Mr. McSweeney had the bad taste to try to stick up our local drug emporium about half an hour ago.&quot;\n\n&quot;And he is now incarcerated in your bastille.&quot;\n\n&quot;Right. And he had your dough on him.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nDiaz and McSweeney\n\nWard sat back in his swivel chair, hooked his thumbs into the arm holes of his vest and beamed.\n\n&quot;Well, I guess that makes it pretty clear. Eh, Mr. Peck? Diaz, the dead pigeon, and this guy McSweeney take it on the lam from the big house. They stick you up, then blow North and land here. They&#39;re going to split, but McSweeney&#39;s a pig. He wants the works. So what does he do? He croaks his pal.&quot;\n\nWard cocked his head and extended his hands, palms outward.\n\n&quot;Okay?&quot;\n\nMr. Peck scratched his chin thoughtfully.\n\n&quot;Well, fairly so,&quot; he answered without enthusiasm. &quot;But before I say how clear, I&#39;d like to see this McSweeney person.&quot;\n\nA moment later a very sullen and defiant Mike McSweeney was ushered into the room.\n\n&quot;Turn around slowly,&quot; Mr. Peck ordered.\n\nThe man sulked, but with a little persuasion, he finally did as he was told.\n\n&quot;Now take your shoes off.&quot;\n\n&quot;Say, what is this, a racket?&quot; the prisoner snarled.\n\n&quot;That will be all,&quot; Mr. Peck murmured after a hasty inspection of McSweeney&#39;s feet. &quot;You may return him to his cell. And unless you care to have him prosecuted for his attempted robbery of the drug store, you may just as well notify the Warden at San Quentin to come up and get him. His list of crimes, I am sorry to say, Ward, does not include the murder of Dominic Diaz.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why — why it&#39;s as plain as the nose on your face,&quot; Ward spluttered as McSweeney was led from the room. &quot;The cigar smelling currency … .&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;ve tried hard,&quot; Mr. Peck interrupted, &quot;very hard, in fact. Your efforts are indeed commendable and I do say that your deductions are plausible, but the fact remains that McSweeney is not the man we are looking for.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, couldn&#39;t have McSweeney poisoned him and then thrown his body on the tracks?&quot;\n\n&quot;He could have,&quot; Mr. Peck conceded, &quot;but there would be no object in attempting to conceal his method of killing his confederate. Besides he is not mentally equipped to think of such things. Offhand, I&#39;d say that his I.Q. is that of an eight year old boy. Remember also, that we are looking for a man — or possibly a woman — who has killed several persons within the past thirty days, using the same method; that of the injection of xetholine caniopus. McSweeney couldn&#39;t have killed any of the others, for the very simple reason that he has been behind bars up to four days ago.&quot;\n\nMr. Peck raised his hand to silence Ward.\n\n&quot;In addition, Mr. Ward, please remember that I have a motor car full of foot print casts. Even in his bare feet, which you saw with your own eyes, he&#39;d overlap those prints a half inch all around. That&#39;s why he&#39;d his shoes removed. Also, you recall that the man who carried Diaz&#39;s body to the railroad tracks possessed feet that pointed outward. McSweeney is decidedly pigeon toed.&quot;\n\nMr. Peck raised his hands, palms upward, and then dropped them to his chubby knees with a sharp slap.\n\n&quot;Now how clear does your case appear?&quot;\n\nWard grunted and stared out of the window.\n\n&quot;On the other hand, Mr. Ward, as I before stated and now repeat, I can put my finger on the murderer within ten minutes, should I care to.&quot;\n\n&quot;Who is it?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll tell you later. There are one or two points I must clear up before I order the arrest. I&#39;d like to drop in and have a talk with Doctor Kraus first. I believe he can furnish what little information I require.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nXetholine Caniopus\n\n&quot;This is Mr. Peck, Doctor Kraus,&quot; Ward said as the pair entered the doctor&#39;s study ten minutes later.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s a pleasure,&quot; Mr. Peck conceded coolly. He drew a newspaper clipping from his pocket and handed it to Doctor Kraus. &quot;To settle an argument, would you read this and give me your opinion?&quot;\n\nThe doctor read the clipping through hastily.\n\n&quot;Why trepanning is nothing new,&quot; he scoffed. &quot;The ancient Egyptians practiced it successfully five thousand years ago. They … &quot;\n\n&quot;Never mind,&quot; Mr. Peck interrupted sharply. &quot;I don&#39;t care a rap if the practice is new or old.&quot;\n\nHe glanced sharply at Ward, who stood gaping in astonishment, then back at the doctor.\n\n&quot;The point is, Doctor Kraus, how does it happen that you are able to read fine news print and yet, while performing autopsies on nine different corpses, you missed the fact that each of those persons had died from a shot of xetholine caniopus as was clearly indicated by the red blotches on the face of each individual victim?&quot;\n\nDoctor Kraus stiffened and stared at his inquisitor with cold precision.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t quite follow you, Mr. Peck,&quot; he said smoothly.\n\n&quot;That likewise makes little difference. I also note that your toes point out considerably more than the toes of the average person.&quot;\n\n&quot;Your remark, Mr. Peck, is not alone vague, but makes no sense; at least not to me.&quot;\n\nWard intervened with a snort.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re crazy, Peck,&quot; he asserted heatedly. &quot;I tell you I&#39;ve known Doctor Kraus all my life. I&#39;ll vouch for him. I … &quot;\n\nMr. Peck silenced Ward with an impatient gesture. Then turning again to Doctor Kraus, he said slowly and clearly, enunciating each word with care and precision.\n\n&quot;There has been a murder committed, Doctor Kraus. As a matter of fact, there have been several murders, but I refer to one in particular; that of one Dominic Diaz, an escaped convict. Diaz died from xetholine caniopus poisoning. Later, his body was placed on the railroad tracks to make it appear that he had been killed by a train and to conceal the fact that he had been poisoned.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, I am aware of the incident,&quot; Doctor Kraus answered evenly. &quot;I performed the autopsy. But … &quot;\n\n&quot;And you also murdered this man, Doctor Kraus!&quot; Mr. Peck glared into the doctor&#39;s eyes as he shot the accusation.\n\nThe old man sucked in a great breath and fell back a step and Ward saw, to his deep consternation, that the kindly light that had shown in Doctor Kraus&#39;s eyes for many a year, was no longer there.\n\n&quot;The tire marks that we found on the road near the scene of the train accident, Doctor Kraus,&quot; Mr. Peck continued, &quot;were made by your car. In addition, Doctor Kraus, the poison was administered most carefully and professionally with a hypodermic needle. Only a physician, or one skilled in the use of such an instrument could so inject a poison as delicate and as deadly as xetholine caniopus.\n\n&quot;Obviously, because of the fact that you yourself were the autopsy surgeon, and because no other person in the County is familiar with such matters, you estimated your chances of detection as being extremely small. But … &quot;\n\nMr. Peck hesitated for a split fraction of a second.\n\n&quot;Drop that!&quot; he shouted, pouncing upon the aged physician and slapping a small glass vial from his hand.\n\nBut his action was just an instant too late, for the next moment, the old man slumped to the floor. Through eyes already dimmed by the instant action of the deadly poison, he peered up at Ward.\n\n&quot;I — I&#39;m sorry, Charlie,&quot; he breathed softly as Ward dropped to his side. &quot;After all these years, I — I&#39;ve brought disgrace to — to our midst.&quot;\n\nWard, panic stricken and terrified, looked up at Mr. Peck, who stood frowning down at the pair.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s nothing we can do, Ward,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Look closely. The red blotches are already forming on his cheeks. Just hold him another ten seconds.&quot;\n\nPresently Ward settled the body of the old man back to the floor. Then he rose and faced Mr. Peck.\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t believe it,&quot; he murmured, looking away. &quot;I just can&#39;t believe it. I can&#39;t see why he should have done it. There wasn&#39;t any reason for it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ah, but there was a reason for it,&quot; Mr. Peck asserted confidently. &quot;Through various channels, I discovered this morning that Doctor Kraus was deeply involved financially. His circumstances were desperate. It was vitally important that he raise two thousand dollars at once.&quot;\n\n&quot;But I can&#39;t see how his killing anybody could have brought him any money. He … &quot;\n\n&quot;You forget, Mr. Ward,&quot; Mr. Pack elucidated with a wry smile, &quot;that Doctor Kraus was not a permanent employee of the County. He was retained, as needed, to perform an autopsy and preside at the inquest. For these services, he was paid at the rate of one hundred dollars a case. Twelve inquests at one hundred each, comes to twelve hundred dollars; or at least it did when I studied mathematics as a small boy. Now, Mr. Ward, is the motive clear?&quot;\n\nWard nodded.\n\n&quot;The doctor needed eight hundred dollars more,&quot; Mr. Peck concluded. &quot;But for a strange set of circumstances which brought me here, you, Mr. Ward, might have been his next victim.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

As a newspaperman, he had frequently exposed many bogus mediums and spiritualists, but the accounts of those who had spent, or rather tried to spend, a night in the Carey house seemed so authentic and honest that Grimstead, who was enjoying his vacation in the quaint New England town of Sedley, longed to experience some of the thrills that had come to these narrators.\n\n&quot;There was a presence in the house,&quot; quavered Martin Stacy, who had once spent part of a night there. &quot;I — I felt it!&quot;\n\n&quot;Could you see it?&quot; asked Grimstead.\n\nMartin shuddered.\n\n&quot;No,&quot; he whispered, &quot;but I knew it was there — whatever it was. If anyone sneaked into your room when you were reading, without making any noise, you would feel they were there even if you hadn&#39;t seen &#39;em — wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;\n\nGrimstead nodded.\n\n&quot;Well, it was that same sort of feeling that came over me in Mrs. Carey&#39;s bedroom.&quot;\n\nMartin Stacy&#39;s story was similar to the others. They had all felt a sinister presence in Mrs. Carey&#39;s room and the feeling had always been followed by senseless, unreasoning terror that made them flee into the night.\n\nThe Carey tragedy had been the grimmest that had ever occurred in the town of Sedley. Twenty years before, Weldon Carey had brought his bride to the old Carey house, which had been built by a colonial Carey and inhabited by Careys ever since. Selma Carey was beautiful and vivacious and she appeared to be as madly in love with the old house and its colonial traditions as she was with its master.\n\nThen came the tragedy! Young Mrs. Carey was found murdered one morning — strangled to death — and her husband told incoherently how two burglars had broken into the place at midnight. One of them had throttled Mrs. Carey and the other was threatening him with a revolver, when some noise frightened them away.\n\nThe countryside was searched for the two men, but they were never apprehended and the verdict of the coroner&#39;s jury was that Mrs. Carey had come to her death &quot;at the hands of a person or persons unknown.&quot;\n\nCarey seemed heart-broken after the tragedy, and finally, not succeeding in selling the old house, he left it in charge of a caretaker and went abroad to live. In all these intervening years he had never returned to his birthplace, nor could anyone be induced to rent the place.\n\nTom Grimstead thought as he stood in front of the Carey mansion at dusk one September afternoon that he had never seen a more repellent-looking house. There was something indescribably repugnant about it, as if one were contemplating the corpse of a house.\n\nHorror surrounded it like a nimbus, and Grimstead&#39;s first impulse was to walk hastily away. But shaking off the feeling of dread that had settled upon him like an incubus, he resolutely walked up the weed-encumbered walk that led to the front door, armed with a key that he had experienced no difficulty in securing from a cynical real-estate agent, who promptly offered to wager that he would not stay the night out — a wager that Grimstead as promptly accepted.\n\nHe carried a handbag that contained a supply of sandwiches, a small automatic, half a dozen fat candles, a flashlight and two volumes of Poe&#39;s grisliest short stories. He ironically thought of these as his &quot;ghost props.&quot;\n\nBut, stout-nerved as he was, Grimstead shrank back instinctively as the front door slammed shut, leaving him in impenetrable darkness. This instantaneous plunge into blackness was sudden enough to daunt anyone, and for a second time that afternoon Grimstead was tempted to abandon his ghost quest.\n\nThen he reflected that thrills were what he had come for, and he was disgusted at the realization that he was allowing his subconscious self to be affected by the stories he had heard. If he were really a skeptic, as he had always prided himself on being, he was on the verge of the most interesting adventure of his none-too-dull life. So he opened his handbag by touch alone, turned on his flashlight and took stock of his surroundings.\n\nHe was in an old-fashioned living room at the far end of which was a huge open fireplace. In front of him a fine specimen of colonial architecture in the shape of an imposing staircase pointed the way to adventure on the second floor. The large room was fully furnished, but a smell of decay and mildew assailed Grimstead&#39;s nostrils.\n\nThe atmosphere was heavy and fetid odors of bygone days seemed to meet and commingle, and the air held a penetrating chill. Something soft brushed his face in the semi-gloom and he started back involuntarily and then laughed nervously.\n\nIt was a death&#39;s-head moth and the creature settled upon the back of a large upholstered chair, its wings spread wide, shivering as the bright ray from the flashlight illumined its ghastly markings.\n\nWith a little shiver that was not entirely due to the chill of the place, Grimstead started up the stairs in search of Mrs. Carey&#39;s bedroom, which, he had been told, was the front room at the left of the upper hallway. But first he explored the other rooms, finding them all furnished but reeking with desolation and decay. Time had wrought sad havoc upon objects of inestimable value to the collector of colonial antiques.\n\nGrimstead now turned the handle of the door that led into the dead woman&#39;s bedchamber and found himself in an ancient boudoir about which still clung an elusive odor of mignonette and lavender.\n\nAgainst one side of the wall was an antique dressing table, but the surface of the long mirror, which had in bygone days often reflected the fair image of Selma Carey, was now opaque, blurred over by the film of years.\n\nNear the dresser was a four-poster bed covered with a yellowed counterpane, and two pillows were in place at its head. It was hard to believe that no one had slept there for twenty years.\n\nWith the exception of the dust that covered everything, and a dank smell, the room and its furnishings appeared to have been left as they were on the day of the tragedy and Grimstead found himself glancing from time to time at the door of the dressing-room, which was about ten feet from the bed, as if he expected a charming figure in deshabille to come romping into the room at any moment.\n\nSo acute was this impression that he strode across the room and threw open the door of the dressing room, peering curiously within. It contained an old-fashioned tin bathtub, the paint from which was chipped off here and there, giving it a dismal look of dilapidation. On a rusty metal towel-rack hung a rotting hath towel, and from a hook in the wall was suspended a mildewed dressing gown that had once been lavender-colored.\n\nWith a look of infinite pity, Grimstead closed the door softly behind him, his vivid imagination conjuring up the picture of a lovely woman with golden hair cascading to her waist, humming a gay little tune as she prepared for her bath.\n\nHe now set the stage for his lonely vigil.\n\nLighting one of his fat candles, he placed it upon the dusty dresser in such a position that its flame illumined the bed.\n\nThen he stuck another above the fireplace on the white marble mantelpiece.\n\nDrawing up a small dressing table, he placed his third candle upon that and then he dusted off a comfortable Morris chair with wide arms and placed it where he could command a view of the entire room. The dressing table was at his left, within easy reaching distance, and on this he placed his sandwiches, his automatic and his volumes of Poe.\n\nSatisfied with these strategic arrangements, he lit his pipe, sank into the big chair and was soon immersed in The Fall of the House of Usher, which he had decided was the proper yarn for the time, the place and the man.\n\nIt was so silent in the house that the scampering of mice in the wainscoting sounded as loud as the romping of Newfoundland dogs. Every now and then one of them would squeal as if it were being murdered, and whenever this happened, Grimstead would pause in his reading and look up with a startled tenseness, expecting to see — he knew not what.\n\nThe wind was rising and it howled and moaned like a tortured spirit striving with futile hands to force an entrance through the rotting eaves of the ancient house. It was an eerie sound and Grimstead found himself forced to exert all his will power in order to concentrate upon the harrowing tale that he was reading. He felt like a spectator awaiting the climax to a particularly dramatic scene in a melodrama.\n\nThere came a lull in the wind and the mice suddenly ceased to scamper as if at a signal from a master mouse. The old house appeared to be waiting in suspense — holding its breath. Grimstead had reached the point in his story where the sound of muffled blows from the vault was reverberating through the ill-fated house of Usher.\n\n&quot;Madman,&quot; he read, &quot;I tell you — &quot;\n\nHe looked up quickly. The dying down of the wind and the cessation of the scamperings in the wainscoting made the room feel as dead as stagnant water looks. But it was not the nerve-racking stillness that had galvanized Grimstead into alert attention.\n\nIt was the unalterable conviction that someone or something was lurking near him. Reaching stealthily for the automatic, he glanced keenly around the room. Certainly he was the only living soul there! But —\n\nThe door of the dressing room was slowly opening!\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nGhostly Footsteps\n\nGrimstead stared incredulously at the widening aperture. He had thoroughly inspected the room less than half an hour before and no living creature could have been concealed there. Nor was there any other door to the room. The thing was impossible — yet it was happening before his eyes!\n\nWider, wider the door opened, and then, as Grimstead held his breath in suspense, something stepped into the room. He could not see it but he felt it, and an icy wind suddenly stirred the roots of his hair at the realization that he was no longer alone. He heard the ghostly sound of footsteps crossing the room and then the candle on the dresser suddenly wavered as if a passing breeze had slightly stirred it.\n\nAs the paralyzed newspaperman gazed wide-eyed from his chair, there came from the dresser the unmistakable sound of hairpins tinkling down into a celluloid tray.\n\nThinking that an over-vivid imagination was playing him tricks, Grimstead, by a tremendous effort of will, sat erect in his chair and was about to spring to his feet, when an amazing thing stupefied him once more into inaction.\n\nThe ghostly footsteps crossed the carpet once more, like the soft brushing of unseen wings, and Grimstead saw the bed suddenly sag — as if a body were lying there — and then one of the pillows became indented — as if a head were resting there.\n\nSomething invisible was reclining upon the bed!\n\nAs this incredible fact percolated through Grimstead&#39;s understanding, blind panic assailed him. Only one thing, he confessed afterward, prevented him from becoming a gibbering idiot. That was his discovery that the door leading into the dressing room, which was wide open after his visitant had entered, was now tightly closed. This tended to convince him that the entire episode was an hallucination due to overwrought nerves.\n\nAt any rate, he sprang to his feet, determined to probe the mystery to its depths, when a sound smote upon his ears that stiffened him in his tracks and made him snatch the automatic hurriedly from the table.\n\nSomeone was coming up the stairs!\n\nHe heard the sound of shuffling, reluctant footsteps, as if the person, thing or whatever it was, were disinclined to make the ascent. Slower and more hesitant became these ominous footsteps, and Grimstead, now utterly unnerved, gripped the automatic frantically and turned a white face in the direction of the bedroom door, not knowing what to expect. But he felt convinced that if this door opened as the other had done and no tangible thing entered he should scream like an hysterical woman.\n\nThe unwilling footsteps had now reached the landing outside the door and came to a halt there, as if the intruder were listening.\n\nThis wait seemed interminable to the crouching newspaperman who stood immovably by the table, his automatic aimed straight at the door.\n\nFinally there was a shuffle of feet and then a hand turned the knob.\n\nSlowly the door opened.\n\n&quot;Hands up,&quot; cried Grimstead hoarsely, &quot;or I&#39;ll shoot.&quot;\n\n&quot;What the devil?&quot; growled a surprised voice, and Grimstead emitted a great sigh of relief. At least it was a human being!\n\nA heavily built, bearded man about fifty years old, a stranger to Grimstead, walked slowly into the room, first glancing around fearfully before allowing his gaze to rest upon Grimstead.\n\n&quot;Now then,&quot; he said coldly, &quot;who are you and what are you doing in this house?&quot;\n\n&quot;Just what I was going to ask you,&quot; grinned Grimstead, his self-possession now fully restored.\n\n&quot;I am — &quot; began the stranger — and then came the crowning horror of that memorable evening. The man&#39;s voice suddenly broke and his tanned face turned livid with fear. He was staring with a look of indescribable terror at the bed.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s that? Who&#39;s there?&quot; he whispered in high-pitched, terror-laden accents.\n\n&quot;Why — what — &quot; stammered Grimstead and then froze into the gaping figure of a man.\n\nThe indentations in the bed and pillow slowly straightened out like a flat automobile tire when the air rushes in.\n\nOnce more Grimstead heard those ghostly footsteps and then the bearded man shrieked like a demon in hell.\n\n&quot;Selma, for God&#39;s sake, don&#39;t!&quot; he gasped. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to do it! I swear I didn&#39;t mean to do it!&quot;\n\nHe staggered back, fumbling at his throat and gasping for breath.\n\n&quot;Take your hands away!&quot; he panted. &quot;My God, you are throttling me!&quot;\n\nHis voice died out in a choking gurgle and he staggered wildly around the room, pulling desperately at his throat as if trying to unloosen the clutch of hands. Grimstead took hold of the struggling figure.\n\n&quot;You are mad!&quot; he cried. &quot;There is no one here!&quot;\n\nThe stranger did not seem to hear.\n\nHis eyes were rolling in his head and his face was turning a mottled purple. Up and down the room he threshed in agony, trying vainly to break the deadly hold that was apparently fastened upon his windpipe with the grip of a maddened bulldog. It was a horrible sight and Grimstead could do nothing but follow the agonized man, who seemed destitute of all reason.\n\nThe end came quickly!\n\nSuddenly there was a rattling sound in the man&#39;s throat and then he sank slowly to his knees and toppled forward on his face. Once more the sound of invisible footsteps and Grimstead looked up from the dead body in time to see the door of the dressing-room open quickly and close.\n\nThen he lost all control over his twitching nerves and ran shrieking out of the room, down the stairs and out into the fresh sweetness of the September night, staggering like a drunken man, his brain reeling from the horrors of that fetid bedroom.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nNothing Is Impossible Nowadays\n\nThe sight of the familiar street and the feel of the wind blowing in his face partially restored his faculties to normal, but he was trembling like a drug fiend as he entered Dr. Stoughton&#39;s office and his speech was so incoherent that the amazed physician was convinced that he was either intoxicated or insane.\n\nBut as the spell of the horror wore away and Grimstead began to talk more rationally Dr. Stoughton realized that this was no ordinary case and that Grimstead was neither intoxicated nor insane. He was that most pathetic of all objects —  a strong man suffering from overwhelming fright.\n\nDr. Stoughton had been the Carey physician and was for many years Weldon Carey&#39;s closest friend. So it was with a very grave face that he went back to the house with Grimstead, accompanied by &quot;Mort&quot; Farley, an official who facetiously called himself Sedley&#39;s &quot;chief of police.&quot;\n\nIt was with a strong shudder that Grimstead entered the house that had shattered his skepticism to bits, and followed the two men upstairs. Everything in the bedroom was just as he had left it. His candles were still burning and his automatic lay where it had fallen from his nerveless hand. In the center of the room was a huddled heap that had once been a man.\n\n&quot;Hm! This looks bad!&quot; ejaculated Dr. Stoughton as he bent above the prostrate figure. He turned the body over and the face peered up at him, distorted and black as a charred log.\n\n&quot;My God, it&#39;s Weldon Carey!&quot; he shouted, drawing back from the corpse in sudden horror.\n\n&quot;How do you know?&quot; asked Farley in awestruck tones. &quot;It has been twenty years — and this man wears a beard.&quot;\n\nDr. Stoughton lifted the man&#39;s limp left hand.\n\n&quot;I can tell by this amethyst ring on the little finger,&quot; he explained. &quot;It was given to him by his mother and he has always worn it on that finger, as it was too small to fit on any of the others.&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you think caused his death, Doctor?&quot; asked Grimstead.\n\n&quot;It was a sudden rush of blood to his head,&quot; said Dr. Stoughton, &quot;caused by a tremendous shock of some sort.&quot;\n\nThen, after a pause: &quot;It couldn&#39;t have been anything else. There are no marks on his throat,&quot; and he looked challengingly at the newspaperman.\n\n&quot;I only know what I know,&quot; replied Grimstead, and he told the whole story again for Farley&#39;s benefit, not omitting the slightest detail. When he had finished, the police official looked doubtfully at Dr. Stoughton. This sort of a case was outside of his own ken.\n\n&quot;Frankly, I am puzzled over all this,&quot; began the physician, looking more closely at the face of the dead man.\n\n&quot;It is very evident that —  Hello!&quot; he broke off abruptly. &quot;This is devilish queer, I must say!&quot;\n\nTaking a small magnifying glass from his bag, he bent over the body and examined the throat carefully.\n\n&quot;This is the most extraordinary thing that has ever come within my medical knowledge,&quot; he said gravely.\n\n&quot;What is it?&quot; asked his companion curiously.\n\n&quot;When I first looked at Carey,&quot; explained the physician, &quot;there were no marks whatever upon his throat. It was strangely white in contrast with his blackened face. But now look!&quot;\n\nHe handed the glass to Grimstead. The newspaperman looked, started, and then looked again. Without a word, he handed the glass to Farley, who looked through it long and hard. Then he whistled softly.\n\n&quot;Finger prints!&quot; he said laconically.\n\n&quot;Exactly,&quot; agreed Dr. Stoughton. &quot;They have come out on the skin like a rash. Carey&#39;s throat looked like an undeveloped negative when I first looked at it. But now, through some queer phenomenon, it has been &#39;developed.&#39;&quot;\n\nA little silence followed his words.\n\n&quot;Did you, perhaps, notice anything else when you looked through the glass?&quot; continued Dr. Stoughton.\n\n&quot;What, for instance?&quot; asked Grimstead.\n\n&quot;Those fingerprints on his throat were those of a woman,&quot; said Dr. Stoughton. &quot;They are much too small to have been inflicted by a man.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good Lord!&quot; said Farley.\n\n&quot;But they couldn&#39;t have been inflicted by a woman,&quot; observed Grimstead satirically, &quot;because you said my story was an hallucination. Beings that figure in hallucinations cannot commit red murders, can they?&quot;\n\n&quot;Humph!&quot; grunted Dr. Stoughton. Then, with a puzzled frown: &quot;What do you think of all this, Grimstead?&quot;\n\n&quot;There is only one way to think.&quot; replied the newspaperman. &quot;Carey undoubtedly murdered his wife and came back to visit the scene of his crime, as murderers from time immemorial have done. His wife&#39;s ghost was in this room. I am as certain of that as I am that my name is Grimstead. It was Selma Carey&#39;s fingers that reached from the grave and strangled her husband.&quot;\n\n&quot;Bosh!&quot; ejaculated the physician. &quot;Such things are impossible!&quot;\n\nGrimstead shrugged his shoulders.\n\n&quot;Nothing is impossible nowadays, Doctor,&quot; he said.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe little man with the gun looked down on the big man who was about to die … .\n\nIn the nearly dark room the odor of incense was overpowering; there seemed to be blood in it. Under the dull red light from the single lamp the big man, scarcely visible, looked like one already dead. He lay curled up on the couch, mouth slack, his features strained as through this deep sleep he knew the presence of death.\n\nTwice the little man raised the gun in a trembling hand! The third lime he fired, point blank, then whirled and fired … .\n\n***\n\nChief of Homicide Lou Stringer let himself down into the doctor&#39;s leather easy chair. He was still young, but there were furrows in his brow and circles under his eyes. He&#39;d gotten his ulcers quarterbacking pro football; they&#39;d grown worse on the police force.\n\nHe said &quot;Hi, Doc.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hello, Lou,&quot; Dr. Dann said. His black eyes, usually sharp, were clouded. The two men were old friends, but this time he didn&#39;t rise, and offer his hand, and start scolding because the homicide chief wasn&#39;t taking care of his ulcers.\n\n&quot;You don&#39;t look so good,&quot; Lou said. &quot;Worried about something?&quot;\n\nHe nodded at the picture of a pretty high school girl on the doctor&#39;s desk.\n\n&quot;Betty here — she still got the Hollywood itch?&quot;\n\nDr. Dann glanced briefly at the picture of his daughter, an expression that he instantly suppressed crossing his face.\n\n&quot;No!&quot; he snapped.\n\n&quot;You needn&#39;t bite my head off. I was only asking.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sorry, Lou,&quot; the doctor relented. &quot;I&#39;ve been irritable — not much sleep. Betty&#39;s all right — now.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Lou said absently. &quot;You didn&#39;t come to talk about Betty.&quot;\n\n&quot;No, I guess not. I don&#39;t really know why I did come.&quot; Lou shrugged helplessly. &quot;You know the way I work. There&#39;s a killing and I go around in a fog, hoping something will turn up.&quot;\n\nDr. Dann leaned back and folded his hands over his stomach.\n\n&quot;I know the way you work,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;You go fumbling around, helpless as a fox. And it doesn&#39;t matter who got killed, or how much he deserved to die — someone always gets convicted for it.&quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s the Victor Starke killing this time.&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course. It happened last night, and it happened only two blocks from here. Whether it&#39;s murder or suicide, if it happens in my neighborhood I can expect you.&quot;\n\n&quot;So can everyone else.&quot; Lou closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the chair. &quot;What can you tell me about the guy?&quot;\n\n&quot;Starke was a vicious criminal the law couldn&#39;t, or wouldn&#39;t, touch,&quot; the doctor said coldly. &quot;He posed as a talent scout, but his real profession was blackmail, though what any woman could see in his vapid face is beyond me. He had his office laid out like a parlor, with incense, concealed music, low lights — &quot;\n\n&quot;You know the layout pretty well. You must have had dealings with him.&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you mean by dealings ?&quot;\n\nThere was a perceptible pause before the homicide chief, his eyes still closed, said, &quot;Medical, of course.&quot;\n\n&quot;No. I went to see him about the Medina girl. She was my patient. He laughed me out of his office. Two weeks later she committed suicide. But you know that.&quot;\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t know why. You didn&#39;t say, the first time. What else ?&quot;\n\n&quot;Nothing else.&quot;\n\n***\n\nLou&#39;s eyes were open now; the lids had parted imperceptibly and his gaze brooded on the picture of Betty.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re not much help,&quot; he said. &quot;Though I can begin to understand now how it is nobody knows anything, nobody saw anything, nobody heard anything. And why nobody wants me to do anything. What you say fits our picture of him. Charges in New York, in Miami and Frisco, but nothing pinned on him. The women wouldn&#39;t testify. He must have had something.&quot;\n\nThe doctor made an ugly sound.\n\nLou ignored it, continuing, &quot;He had a few theater-agency connections to maintain a front. Now take Betty here — &quot;\n\n&quot;Leave Betty out of it!&quot; Dr. Dann snarled, half-rising from his chair.\n\n&quot;No offense, Doc,&quot; Lou said mildly. &quot;I was just going to use her for an example.&quot;\n\n&quot;Use somebody else!&quot;\n\n&quot;Okay, okay. Let&#39;s take the Medina girl. Starke sees her, tells her she has possibilities, and gives her his card. The first couple of times she comes to his office — he called it a studio — everything is on the up and up. He gives her a script to read, coaches her a bit, and pretty soon he&#39;s got the kid dizzy thinking she&#39;s going places. Then he works up to that low lights and soft music routine — &quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear these details!&quot; Dr. Dann cried. &quot;I know what his methods were! He&#39;s dead, and that ends it!&quot;\n\n&quot;Sorry Doc. I was just thinking aloud. I got a pretty good idea what happened, but if you&#39;re busy … .&quot;\n\n&quot;Go on.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, once in a while he got a kid with talent and turned her over to a coaching school, tying her up with a contract. But someone like the Medina girl might end up performing at stag parties. The bait would be raising money for her career, getting experience — the kid would believe anything he told her. A nice deal for Starke, who got fifty percent of what she earned. Not so good for the girl, who went along step by step until she was way over her head. So the motive wasn&#39;t hard to find. One of the girls — &quot;\n\n&quot;No,&quot; Dr. Dann began, but the homicide chief interrupted with an upraised hand.\n\n&quot;Ever chivalrous, eh, doc? Can&#39;t believe a woman would do it ? I was going to say one of the girls had a boyfriend, father — some man who wouldn&#39;t stand by and take it any more than I would if it was my kid. We know it was a man because we have a clear heel-print on the waxed floor. Now all we have to do is locate him. It shouldn&#39;t be hard. Starke left a complete file card on all his girls.&quot;\n\nDr. Dann exhaled slowly.\n\n&quot;Knowing all you do about Starke, you still intend to track down the man who him? You intend to expose and disgrace the girl that man was trying to protect? Or avenge?&quot;\n\n&quot;My job is to bring the man in,&quot; the homicide chief said doggedly. &quot;If he were my own brother I&#39;d have to do it. What happens then is up to the jury.&quot;\n\nHe was silent a moment.\n\n&quot;Funny thing you should say he was shot. I didn&#39;t mention that, nor did the newspapers.&quot;\n\n&quot;I assumed.&quot;\n\nLou shrugged.\n\n&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter. He was shot all right. And that&#39;s the embarrassing thing about this case. We&#39;d rather not find the man who shot him. There&#39;s no charge we can hold him on.&quot;\n\nDr. Dann stared.\n\n&quot;That doesn&#39;t make sense!&quot;\n\n&quot;It makes plenty of sense. The door to Starke&#39;s place was open, so our man with the gun didn&#39;t break in. Nobody heard the shot, so he didn&#39;t disturb the peace. And — he didn&#39;t kill Starke. In that light, and wrought up the way he must have been, he wouldn&#39;t notice that Starke was already dead, with the knife still in his back. Fingerprints on it, too, by the way. So you can see why we&#39;re just quietly forgetting the man with the gun.&quot;\n\nFor a moment the two men faced each other. Then the homicide chief said, &quot;You ought to take a week off. Doc. You&#39;re looking peaked.&quot;\n\nHe placed a five-by-eight file card on the desk and stood up to leave.\n\n&quot;Something for you to get rid of,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;I know you didn&#39;t kill Starke, and there&#39;s no use dragging Betty&#39;s name into this.&quot;\n\nLou paused at the door and looked inquiringly over his shoulder at the doctor&#39;s call.\n\nDr. Dann was standing behind his desk, a little man whose flashing black eyes offset his lack of stature.\n\n&quot;About those ulcers, you. Be in my office tomorrow. It&#39;s an order!&quot;\n\n&quot;Okay.&quot; Lou grinned. &quot; Be seeing you, Doc.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

He spoke bluntly.\n\n&quot;No!&quot; he snapped. &quot;You&#39;re wrong, McLeod!&quot;\n\nThe general raised his own fists, but his thumbs pointed steadfastly toward the ceiling.\n\n&quot;The Navy,&quot; he said, &quot;is going the same place the Army is — up, not down! &quot;\n\nCentral Intelligence — the Secret Service for all U. S. Military branches — was rarely surprised by General Steven Hackett, but at precisely ten o&#39;clock on this April morning, there was a brief, hushed pause.\n\nAmong the twenty special agents of was a single girl. She had to be something special to belong with these men. She was blonde, very blonde, almost platinum. She stood out like a new silver coin among a handful of old dimes.\n\nThis poetic observation was made from the back row by Joe Pyle. Joe regarded himself as an outcast in the group. He had come up by way of Bookkeeping, with a brief stopover in Secret Files. He could feel the others&#39; contempt for him, although they always gave him credit for trying. &quot;Good old methodical Joe,&quot; was the way they put it.\n\nJoe noticed that Miss Mason — Lieutenant Mason — was in the act of replying to the general. He sat up straighter and listened.\n\n&quot;You don&#39;t mean, sir,&quot; she said, &quot;that the Navy is about to be — ah — swallowed by the Air Force?&quot;\n\n&quot;I mean,&quot; the general replied sternly, &quot;that the oceans of our dwindling planet are becoming of less and less strategic importance. Let us be realistic. A superbly trained body of men like the U. S. Navy cannot be used solely in defense of that portion of the world exclusively inhabited by fish and lesser mammals. At an appropriate time the Navy will be moved bodily to a new theater of operations.&quot;\n\nThe general repeated the gesture of the upright thumbs.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Most Secret Scientific Undertaking Of Modern Times\n\nThe general pressed the tip of a pointer on a map of the United States at a vacant space in an area known as the Great American Desert.\n\n&quot;Approximately here is a very large factory,&quot; he said. &quot;It is building a special kind of ship for the Navy, gentlemen … and — er — Lieutenant Mason.&quot;\n\nThe general always referred to the lone female in his department with a twist of his lean, brown lips and a fierce lowering of one shaggy eyebrow. The lady hampered his style.\n\n&quot;Imagine ships, giant battleships, built and launched in the heart of a desert,&quot; the general went on. &quot;The next war will be decided not by land, sea, or air. Space will be the element. The Navy of the future will travel on the dreadnaughts of space. We already know how to get the ships upstairs. We are now engaged in the problem of keeping &#39;em there. That is the military project known as Operation Topside.&quot;\n\nThe members of Central Intelligence had already caught up with the general. They leaned forward in their chairs.\n\nOperation Topside, Joe gathered from the general&#39;s rapid explanation, was the most secret scientific undertaking of modern times. It was absolutely hush-hush. All workers at the project had signed on for five years. They were completely isolated in a self-sufficient city, surrounded by electric fences, guarded by an outer detachment of U. S. Marines. Radio detectors prevented any possible leak by short-wave from inside the plant. And yet, somehow, there was a leak.\n\nThe general&#39;s pointer had jumped from one map to another on the opposite wall.\n\n&quot;Counter-Intelligence reports that right here in the deepest portion of enemy territory is an exact duplicate of our own factory. Every new development in our project appears immediately in theirs. Without question at least one enemy agent is a trusted official at Operation Topside. We have even narrowed down his identity to one of five persons.\n\n&quot;Those five are the only men who have had access to all of the secrets which have subsequently passed into enemy hands. We know, therefore, approximately who is guilty. Our problem is not who, but how … How does this spy get his information outside of a factory which we know to be absolutely sealed?&quot;\n\nJoe Pyle cleared his throat.\n\n&quot;Sir,&quot; he said hoarsely, and then, unheard, rose to his feet, licked his lips, and repeated, &quot;Sir!&quot;\n\n&quot;Lieutenant Pyle?&quot; the general thundered.\n\nHeads came around idly to regard Joe like a small boy who had just asked to leave the room. Joe was aware of the sardonic smile of Colonel Barry McLeod and the friendly amusement of Lieutenant Sarah Mason. He flushed.\n\n&quot;Could it be, sir, that they get information out of our project the same way we get it out of theirs?&quot;\n\nThe general regarded Joe like one who had spoken treason.\n\n&quot;They, Mr. Pyle, are never quite as far along as we are,&quot; he replied curtly. &quot;The enemy has always been a step behind us — in science, in production, in counter-intelligence. We intend to keep him there.&quot;\n\nJoe sat down. Don&#39;t be too sure of that, general, he thought. Maybe sometime, somewhere, one bright little enemy will get an idea before we do …\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Problem of the Master Spy\n\nCentral Intelligence went about the problem of the master spy with its usual efficiency. Colonel Barry McLeod was assigned the meatiest job — a secret investigation of Operation Topside itself. Lieutenant Sarah Mason would be his chief assistant.\n\nThe subordinate tasks were quickly distributed by McLeod. For the dangerous assignments, Joe Pyle was completely overlooked. As a secret agent, Joe thought grimly, he was never allowed to strain anything except his eyesight.\n\n&quot;It seems, Lieutenant Pyle, that we have nothing for you to do,&quot; General Hackett observed. &quot;Fit yourself in wherever you can. Perhaps someone will think of something.&quot;\n\nBy lunch time Colonel McLeod had nothing to offer Joe but advice. The two men sat in a corner booth of a little Pentagon restaurant with Sarah Mason between them.\n\nBeing the only woman on the staff, Sarah always had to be shared with someone. Joe could never remember talking to her alone. That was Central Intelligence for you — it know all the world&#39;s secrets but had no secrets of its own, not so much as a furtive whisper behind a hand.\n\n&quot;Tell you what, Joe,&quot; McLeod offered, &quot;we&#39;ll let you be coordinator. We&#39;ll shoot the facts out of Topside and you can line &#39;em up in order.&quot;\n\nA friendly slap on the shoulder caught Joe off guard and nearly knocked him into his coffee cup. McLeod was a fine physical specimen, a legendary figure, the superspy of World War II. He had large, visible muscles and a rather painful habit of using them.\n\n&quot;Colonel,&quot; Joe said, &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hmmmm,&quot; McLeod responded doubtfully.\n\n&quot;You and Sarah can handle the active part of this investigation, Colonel. I&#39;d like to take a crack at the inactive.&quot;\n\n&quot;Meaning what?&quot;\n\n&quot;Let me go over the past records of the five suspects. Some of those boys have been planted for years, but somewhere along the line they&#39;re bound to make a slip.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hmmmm,&quot; the colonel considered.\n\n&quot;I know Joe can do it,&quot; Sarah Mason said warmly, dropping a slim left hand on his wrist. Joe felt a physical leap inside of himself that must have been visible to the naked eye. The sensation was not lasting, for she promptly placed her right hand on Barry McLeod&#39;s forearm, linking the three of them in a union which seemed to Joe slightly overcrowded.\n\nMcLeod shrugged. &quot;Okay, Joe, you&#39;re a free agent.&quot;\n\n&quot;Fine. But tell me one thing,&quot; Joe said. &quot;Just what kind of project is so much of a mystery anymore that they have to throw an electric fence and a company of Marines around it?&quot;\n\nMcLeod pressed a finger across his lips.\n\n&quot;Top secret,&quot; he said, and grinned. &quot;But there&#39;s one thing I do know. I got it by my private little grapevine. They&#39;re experimenting with some kind of radiant energy. The Marines outside the fence say the animals are going crazy.&quot;\n\n&quot;The animals?&quot; Joe repeated curiously. McLeod nodded and crossed his arms wisely. &quot;That whole desert area is No Man&#39;s Land for dogs, coyotes, or what have you. They go nuts.&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t get it,&quot; Joe said. &quot;There&#39;s a lot of difference between knocking a dog off his feet and lifting a battleship sky high. I suppose the Overhead Fleet will eventually be harnessed to a team of trained atoms — but what kind of atomic energy affects a dog and not a man?&quot;\n\nMcLeod smiled. &quot;That is the secret … .&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nJoe Finds His Man\n\n&quot;One other thing,&quot; Joe remarked later, when the lunch was over and he had torn his eyes away from the lovely, feminine profile of Lieutenant Mason. &quot;How far outside the project are those Marines billeted?&quot;\n\n&quot;They&#39;re stationed a mile away, but they work hourly shifts, patrolling a brightly lighted circle about two hundred yards outside the fence.&quot;\n\n&quot;Have they been screened by C. I.?&quot; Joe asked.\n\n&quot;Why should they be?&quot; McLeod snapped. &quot;None of &#39;em ever gets inside the project&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, but what if there&#39;s a team — one man inside and one on the outer guard? Could they possibly pass signals to each other?&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s been checked. The only contacts between outside and inside are made by the delivery trucks. The same men and trucks never stay on the job, so that could hardly be the leak. The inside workers are under constant observation. Their outdoor life is confined entirely to an enclosed playground. No one has access to the roof of the plant except the inspectors, who work in groups of three. Suppose someone was actually signaling with mirrors, for instance, in the bright sunlight. That&#39;s a cute idea, but impossible. The workers never use anything but a patch of blue sky directly overhead.&quot;\n\n&quot;Whew!&quot; Joe wiped the hot dampness of his neck. &quot;Where were they recruited, from Sing-Sing and Alcatraz?&quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s all a matter of patriotism,&quot; McLeod said. &quot;Plus about a thousand bucks a month, which is more than any of &#39;em will earn the rest of their lives.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; Joe said, &quot;if you two people once get inside that place, I hope they let you out again. That goes especially, Lieutenant, for you!&quot;\n\nJoe leaned impulsively forward and kissed the lieutenant on her soft, round cheek. It was, he thought afterward, the most surprising thing he had ever done — and the best. …\n\nThe five suspects were named Gonzales, Goldberg, Duganne, McKrosky, and Jones — a strangely American assortment of names. By the end of a week Joe Pyle had accumulated enough material on them to fill a whole shelf of biographical novels. They were all American-born. They had been, variously, fined for drunken driving, divorced, jailed for income tax evasion, bankrupt, and sued for libel, but these were typical American failings.\n\nJoe plunged deeper. Some wise old spy back in World War II had once told Joe that he could read a man&#39;s life like a fortune teller if he only had access to the man&#39;s bank account. Joe recalled the advice and played it as a hunch. He requested and got the complete financial records of all five men. For another week he worked tirelessly, vainly, and then at last when his eyes were popping from the strain, and his brain reeling with fatigue, he found something. …\n\n&quot;General Hackett, sir,&quot; Joe said on the phone, &quot;can you give me the approximate date that Operation Topside first began to take shape?&#39;&#39;\n\n&quot;Yes. January, 1947.&#39;&#39;\n\n&quot;Great,&quot; Joe said. &quot;I may have a lead.&quot;\n\n&quot;Who is it?&quot;\n\n&quot;Man by the name of Duganne.&quot;\n\n&quot;Duganne?&quot;\n\nThe general swore with the vocabulary of a top sergeant.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s our own nun, Joe. He was planted at Topside to prevent the very thing you&#39;re accusing him of.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not accusing him, sir, but it&#39;s reasonable enough. If we can plant our men in the enemy&#39;s secret service, why couldn&#39;t they plant a few men in our — &quot;\n\n&quot;Lieutenant Pyle!&quot; the General roared. &quot;Let me hear no more of your comparisons between our Intelligence and the enemy&#39;s. If it must be Duganne, let it be; but you bad damn well better have proof!&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, sir, in January, 1947, Duganne&#39;s bank account took a jump of two thousand dollars. Then a few days later it was back to normal.&quot;\n\n&quot;You may have something at that, Pyle.&quot;\n\nThe general hung up.\n\nJoe sighed and went hack to work on the record of Will Duganne, all the way back to his original application for secret service. There the precise and intricate pattern of Joe&#39;s memory came to his rescue. He found a discrepancy between Duganne&#39;s first medical report and his latest examination, just previous to entering Operation Topside. There was one tiny difference under the heading of Physical Defects.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Makings of a Case\n\nJoe now had the makings of a case.\n\nHe began to talk to people — a girl in the front office who had kept luncheon dates with Duganne, a landlady in Baltimore, a telephone operator, an airline hostess. The evidence all took the same shape: Duganne had spent a week in New York City in January of &#39;47.\n\nJoe flew to New York. He lay on a bed in his hotel room with a classified directory in his lap and called numbers. His phone bill had run to ten dollars by the time he got the right answer.\n\n&quot;Dr. Sheldrake?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yuh,&quot; replied a thick, dispirited voice. &quot;Did you have a patient back in 1947 named Will Duganne?&quot;\n\n&quot;Wouldn&#39;t remember. Lots of patients, all sizes, sexes, names — &quot;\n\n&quot;This man was from Washington, D.C.&quot;\n\n&quot;Washington? Let me see, now. I don&#39;t get many from there.&quot;\n\n&quot;It was a two-thousand-dollar job.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, yes! Remember that one, largest fee I ever charged.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll be right over,&quot; Joe said eagerly.\n\nDr. Sheldrake was a thin, bald, harassed-looking man.\n\n&quot;Secret Service, huh?&quot; he grunted. &quot;I admit that two thousand dollars was an exorbitant fee, but I didn&#39;t think there was a Federal law — &quot;\n\nJoe grinned. &quot;I&#39;m not after you, Doctor. Duganne&#39;s my man. I want to know the nature of a job which cost two thousand bucks.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, it was a downright sin. I could have refused to do it, of course. Instead I quoted an outrageous price, thinking to scare him off. The crazy fool accepted my price!&quot;\n\n&quot;Exactly what,&quot; Joe asked the dentist, &quot;was this outrageous job?&quot;\n\n&quot;Why, I tell you the man had a perfect set of natural teeth — perfect, mind you — and he wanted me to yank every one of them out!&quot;\n\nDr. Sheldrake took a drink from the perpetual fountain beside his dental chair and spat savagely into the bowl.\n\n&quot;He wanted two sets of false teeth. Joked with me about it. Getting a bargain, he said. Two new sets for one old one … !&quot;\n\nIt couldn&#39;t be happening to Joe Pyle. Joe privately pinched himself. Yes, he was definitely awake and here he was inside Operation Topside in a small, windowless room addressing a group which included Barry McLeod, Sarah Mason, and even General Hackett. Among them was a small, tight-lipped man with coalblack eyes and dark, shiny skin. His name was Will Duganne.\n\n&quot;I have evidence that messages are being relayed from inside this project to a man in the outer guard,&quot; Joe said.\n\nIt was Duganne himself who replied. His voice was dry and thin. &quot;We have interception crews on both sides of the walls.&quot;\n\n&quot;This is not short-wave, not radar, nothing like that,&quot; Joe snapped. &quot;The transmitter and receiver are so tiny as to be easily concealed on the human body. I want a complete physical examination of every person — &quot;\n\n&quot;Joe!&quot; Colonel Barry McLeod was on his feet. His handsome bronze face mastered a trace of scorn and he smiled at Joe, condescendingly. &quot;We understand your affection for small detail, Lieutenant Pyle, but do you realize that there are five thousand persons inside these walls? It would take weeks.&quot;\n\nJoe reddened slightly, but swallowed his anger. Barry had given him a nice opening for his own plan.\n\n&quot;How many men in the outer guard?&quot; he asked.\n\n&quot;A few hundred, at a guess,&quot; General Hackett replied.\n\n&quot;Well, then, let&#39;s start outside and grab the accomplice first,&quot; Joe said. &quot;Under pressure he may help us to identify his partner.&quot;\n\nThe general was willing. He had heard part of Joe&#39;s fantastic theory, but he wanted proof.\n\n&quot;We&#39;d better take somebody along from inside,&quot; Joe suggested. &quot;Can you come with us, Duganne?&quot;\n\n&quot;Why?&quot;\n\nJoe had not expected that answer. He felt himself growing tongue-tied, and wished he had some of Barry McLeod&#39;s poise in a tight situation. A glance at Sarah Mason, leaning forward in her chair, lips slightly parted, brought back his confidence.\n\n&quot;You know the project better than we do,&quot; he told Duganne. &quot;If we nab the right man, you should be the one to question him.&quot;\n\nDuganne licked his thin lips and nodded.\n\nThe general, with a few magic words, was able to get the Secret Service party outside of that vast prison. He was probably the only man in the country who could have accomplished such a quick, miraculous passage through the walls.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nThe Search For the Outside Man\n\nThey rode in a jeep, four men and a girl. Duganne drove with the general beside him. In the rear seat Joe and Barry McLeod had Lieutenant Mason between them, tossed joltingly from man to man.\n\nFor miles around stretched a blistering, misty plain of sand and scrawny cactus. Behind them was the shapeless, windowless pile of Operation Topside, a tremendous monument to man&#39;s ingenuity — or his stupidity.\n\nThey raced straight to headquarters of the guard encampment and General Hackett spoke a few words with a Marine captain. Five minutes later the entire company of Marines was standing in full dress on the parade ground.\n\n&quot;All right, what&#39;s the next move, Lieutenant Pyle?&quot; demanded the General. His lean face, accustomed to Washington air-conditioning, was sunburned to a raw, red flame.\n\nJoe was saved the necessity of replying by the sudden appearance of a lieutenant to report that a single man was missing from his platoon, a Sergeant Thomas Cunningham.\n\nJoe, in turn, saved the Marine captain a stroke of apoplexy by shouting: &quot;That must be our spy! My guess, sir, is that Cunningham has been warned from inside the walls. He&#39;s skipped out on us.&quot;\n\n&quot;How could he be warned?&quot; blustered Duganne.\n\nGeneral Hackett was reasonably calm. &quot;Let&#39;s get after him.&quot;\n\nColonel McLeod took command, standing in the jeep, barking questions: &quot;How did he escape, by machine or afoot?&quot;\n\n&quot;Foot,&quot; the Marine lieutenant said. &quot;All equipment is accounted for.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where would a man logically seek cover?&quot;\n\n&quot;East,&quot; said the Marine, pointing. &quot;There&#39;s a dry river. It gets deep and rugged, with a lot of caves, and runs south toward the nearest town.&quot;\n\n&quot;Duganne, let&#39;s go,&quot; McLeod snapped. The jeep took off with a jerk. A lesser man would have been thrown out on his head, but McLeod stayed upright gracefully as a bareback circus rider, shouting over his shoulder, &quot;Organize a manhunt and follow us!&quot;\n\nThe jeep bounded across country like a startled gazelle. Joe found Lieutenant Sarah Mason in his lap. Before he could appreciate the situation, a flying bump reversed them and he was sitting on the girl&#39;s knees.\n\nNothing like this, he thought, had ever happened in the filing department!\n\nSarah was thinking of duty, not of Joe.\n\n&quot;Whoever warned Cunningham so quickly must have known that Secret Service was investigating Topside.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah. What&#39;s the answer to that, Duganne?&quot; Barry McLeod asked the driver, who only shook his dark head, gritted his teeth, and drove on.\n\nThe jeep shot up a slope and a great gasp went out of their combined lungs at the awful gap which broke suddenly before them. Duganne kicked at the brake, pulled the wheel, and they churned sideward in a blinding shower of sand.\n\nBlinking away the dust, they saw a crooked chasm of tumbling, frozen lava, brilliantly colored in the angled sunlight. Colonel McLeod leaped to the ground, running down-canyon.\n\n&quot;Fan out!&quot; he called back.\n\nThe others moved after him. All but Joe.\n\n&quot;Hey! Wait a minute!&quot;\n\nGeneral Hackett turned about, eyes narrowed against the smart of the sun. Sarah Mason hesitated, halfway down the rough slope. Duganne broke his stride with visible reluctance.\n\nJoe jerked a shoulder the other way, up-canyon.\n\n&quot;The enemy,&quot; he said, &quot;never does the thing we expect him to.&quot;\n\nThe twist of General Hackett&#39;s mouth vaguely resembled a smile. &quot;Lead away, Joe.&quot;\n\n&quot;What about Barry?&quot; Sarah said.\n\n&quot;If Cunningham went that way, Barry will catch him,&quot; Joe said generously. &quot;Barry&#39;s a one-man army.&quot;\n\nHe was back in command again now and it felt good. Directing the others to form a broadtoothed comb, he led them up the canyon.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nThe Evidence\n\nThe general and Duganne moved on the outer flanks. Joe and Sarah were down in the deep confinement of the river bed. They almost came together as the rocks constricted. Joe kept his eyes with difficulty on the trail whenever the lieutenant hiked her skirts and leaped, trim-legged as a deer, from rock to rock.\n\nAs they progressed, the dry lava bed slowly flattened into a vast field of black monoliths, gloomy as a cemetery at twilight.\n\nWherever the rock was broken by crevices or caves which might have hidden a man, one of the searchers would kneel for a closer look. At his far left Joe saw Will Duganne vanish into one of the caves and immediately come out again, scrambling hastily ahead without a kickward glance.\n\n&quot;Hey!&quot;\n\nThey all scowled back at Joe in the dying red of the sun. He pointed to the left where the lava formed a ragged, toothlike rim to the valley.\n\n&quot;Get up higher, Duganne,&quot; he called. &quot;He might try to circle back on us.&quot;\n\nWhile Duganne ran in that direction, Joe darted to his own left, flung himself flat on the rock long enough to peer into a shallow hole which ended in a deep, wary blackness. He was up again, striding forward, beckoning to Sarah and the general.\n\nThey came together on a pocked, tortured slope of grey pumice.\n\n&quot;Duganne, come back!&quot;\n\nThe dark little man was climbing on all fours. He turned about in a startled, catlike spring.\n\nJoe climbed to a point within reach of Duganne&#39;s ankles.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re under arrest,&quot; Joe said.\n\nDuganne was marvelously swift. His face did not even change expression. His hand simply slid under his jacket and out again, palming a flat, black pistol.\n\n&quot;I would not advise enforcement of that order, Lieutenant,&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;General Hackett.&quot; Joe flung words hack ward without turning. &quot;Duganne has been signaling his partner as we went along. He sent Cunningham up-canyon instead of down. He even guided him into a hiding place. You can verify that by looking into that cave which Duganne reported as empty. Either there&#39;s a man inside it or somebody threw away a nice, new pair of shoes.&quot;\n\nDuganne spoke quietly, his teeth flashing with pearly whiteness.\n\n&quot;Intelligence cannot afford to expend your life, General Hackett, even for two foreign agents. I have six shots in this gun — and the situation requires only three.&quot;\n\nJoe had once taken a course in disarming a man, but he could not at the moment recall the first lesson. He might have dived for the legs but that would only bring Sarah Mason into a wild, dangerous melee. He wished that Colonel McLeod had stayed with them. McLeod would know what to do.\n\nHis wish was miraculously granted when a chunk of lava came hurtling over the rim of the valley and struck Duganne squarely in the back.\n\nDuganne stumbled to his knees, whirled with a snarling sound, and Joe threw out a blow which caught the man sideward on the chin, accomplishing the last thing Joe had expected. Out of Duganne&#39;s distorted mouth flew a shiny white crescent. It struck the ground with a snap and foiled away in a wet clot of dust.\n\nJoe quickly stepped on the thing and faced the gunman challengingly. Duganne wiped the sinister vacantness of his mouth and suddenly dashed away, dodging and weaving. He was over the rim before anyone could draw a gun.\n\nBarry McLeod leaped into sight, firing two quick shots which ricochetted harmlessly.\n\nJoe waved. &quot;I&#39;ve got the evidence, Barry!&quot;\n\nMcLeod shrugged and strode nimbly downward.\n\n&quot;Couldn&#39;t shoot at first,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;You were all in the line of fire. I had to throw a blasted rock!&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nThe Prize\n\nJoe was dusting off his prize.\n\n&quot;Look, false teeth,&quot; he said. &quot;Duganne had two sets of &#39;em made, one to pass the physical exam and another which he doctored up for his own purposes and clapped into his mouth just before he came into Topside. See these little slits between the teeth? Sound comes out there — like a pipe-organ.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sound?&quot; the general muttered.\n\n&quot;Wrong word, I guess,&quot; Joe admitted. &quot;Ultra-sound. I got the idea from Barry, when he told me the dogs were going crazy. I knew science had been dabbling in supersonics — that is sound which is pitched too high for the human ear to hear. Dogs can hear it, though, and it makes &#39;em jump.&quot;\n\nHe pointed to the false teeth.\n\n&quot;Here — see this little row of holes in the back of the gums ? Duganne whistled Morse Code super-sonic signals into that, like a kid with a mouth organ. Cunningham caught &#39;em and translated. Photographic mind, probably. Let&#39;s go back and haul Cunningham out of that hole. We&#39;ll probably find the receiver imbedded in his inner ear.&quot;\n\nGeneral Hackett swore, glanced aside at Sarah Mason, Hushed, and then swore again.\n\n&quot;A miniature broadcasting set, built right into the man&#39;s teeth!&quot;\n\nJoe found himself being pounded warmly by Colonel McLeod.\n\n&quot;Nice work, Pyle. Couldn&#39;t have done better myself.&quot;\n\nThe general wrapped the teeth in a clean handkerchief. He regarded Joe with dusty, red-rimmed eyes that seemed to peel the imaginary silver bar right off his shoulders.\n\n&quot;Well, Captain Pyle, how do you propose to capture the body which belongs to these teeth?&quot;\n\nJoe laughed, with a boldness he had never felt before.\n\n&quot;Let Duganne go back to his own country and report his failure, sir. That&#39;s a sure way to end his career.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re a captain, Joe,&quot; Sarah added. &quot;Now I can look up to you.&quot;\n\nShe stood below him on the rough slant of the black shale, eyes slanting prettily in the red dusk, and there was something special in her voice, something beyond the ken of ordinary men — something that only Joe Pyle could hear.\n\n~ The End ~\n"

The bullied, overworked, nerve-ridden clerk would have heaved one more sigh at his own inadequacy, and gone his weary way.\n\nBut his over-imaginative mind had so far anticipated events that he already regarded himself as having killed some hundreds of the enemy. If he had not actually done this, he felt that it was only a matter of days before he would be doing so, and he had thus brought himself to the frame of mind of the hot-blooded killer.\n\nLike the nation in its entirety at that moment, he was in the mood for suiting actions to thoughts, and, thrusting his paper in his jacket pocket, he hurried into the block of offices and darted swiftly up six sets of curving stairs.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Fatal Punch\n\nNo one saw him. He just managed to reach the first landing as the caretaker came out of his basement and closed the double front door of the offices, and the remainder of the stairs were deserted.\n\nOn the sixth floor he thrust open the outer office door labelled &quot;M. Anderson Blount, Fur and Glove Importer.&quot; This led him through the little office which he himself had occupied until a few minutes before, through the typists&#39; room, and into Blount&#39;s private office, which overlooked the street.\n\nStanding looking through the wide-open window, his back to the large desk, by the side of which was a dictaphone, was the portly figure of Blount.\n\nBlount had been making a habit of speaking his thoughts into this machine every evening, and the typists made what they could of these, filing their transcripts away against the time when they should be required for moulding into the form of &quot;A Business Man&#39;s Private Diary,&quot; which was the title of the book he intended publishing.\n\nIt did not need the sight of Blount&#39;s placid figure to incense Meadowes to murder pitch. He was still fired by the impulse that had sent him scurrying in from the pavement below.\n\n&quot;Stirring, isn&#39;t it, Blount?&quot; he said suddenly.\n\nHe had never called Blount anything but &quot;sir &quot; before.\n\nBlount turned and started at the sight of Meadowes&#39; inflamed countenance and the fanatical glint in his eyes.\n\n&quot;They&#39;re off to fight to make you a bit fatter.&quot;\n\n&quot;What the devil do you want?&quot; exclaimed Blount, in surprise.\n\n&quot;But it will be in vain. You aren&#39;t going to get fat — see!&quot;\n\nMeadowes threw himself at his late employer with complete abandon.\n\nBlount gasped as Meadowes&#39; shoulder rammed against his stomach, and he sat heavily on the windowsill, grabbing frantically at Meadowes&#39; clothes.\n\nMeadowes&#39; fist thudded into his face, and Blount&#39;s head struck hard against the under edge of the raised window-frame, stunning him.\n\nBlount toppled over and hurtled to the pavement far below.\n\nThe shouts of the people down there drowned the sounds of the band for a moment.\n\nMeadowes stepped back into the somewhat darkened room, with the certain knowledge that no one had seen the attack.\n\nHe glanced at the dictaphone, and found that it was switched off, and that there was no record in it. Then, after a swift inspection of the office to assure himself that he was leaving no trace of his visit, he went to the outer door.\n\nHe would join the army that night, and his mind would thenceforth be sufficiently occupied to banish all memory of what had happened.\n\nThere were voices in the passage below, and people were coming up the stairs.\n\nHis escape was cut short, but he was not at a loss.\n\nHanging his hat on the peg in his own office, he sat at his desk, turning papers out of the drawer.\n\nThe disquieting thought that Blount might have lived to tell of the attack proved a false alarm. The police constable who came in told him that Blount was dead, and asked if he had seen him fall.\n\n&quot;No, I didn&#39;t see him fall. Goodness! What&#39;s happened?&quot; gasped Meadowes, giving a realistic display of alarm.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Newspaper Mystery\n\nDixon Hawke heard the inquest because he happened to be sitting in the East Central Coroner&#39;s Court when it came on. He was interested in another case, but he became even more interested in this one.\n\nHis friend, Detective-Inspector Gray, deposed to the effect that the deceased had had a copy of the latest issue of the Evening Comet in his hand. It was a special edition issued on account of the crisis, and the witness&#39;s own conclusion was that he had either fallen out in his excitement or had committed suicide in despair.\n\nThe tragic incident had occurred at ten minutes past eight.\n\nJohn Meadowes stated that he had returned to his office at eight, and had sat at his desk collecting his private papers, that being his last day of employment there. He had been there for about ten minutes when the police came up and informed him of what had happened.\n\nThe caretaker of the block of offices then gave evidence. He stated that he was not aware that Mr. Meadowes had returned. He (the caretaker) had been watching the band; he had left the doorway for only a minute to go into the basement, and Mr. Meadowes must have come in during that time.\n\nHe knew that Mr. Blount was still in the building, for he was waiting for the lift-bell to ring. Mr. Blount always used the lift.\n\nTommy Burke, Hawke&#39;s young assistant, who was sitting in the court by his employer&#39;s side, suddenly became aware that Hawke was staring at him, frowningly.\n\n&quot;You remember we were jammed in New Bridge Street in the car last night?&quot; he murmured.\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n&quot;Yes. On account of those troops.&quot;\n\n&quot;That was at seven minutes past eight, and the newsboys were rushing out of the Comet office with the first batches of that special edition.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes. You bought one.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right. It must have taken the fellow another minute to get up Farringdon Street.&quot;\n\nTommy saw his point, and nodded.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t suppose Blount slid down the bannisters to get his paper, sir!&quot;\n\n&quot;He&#39;d have needed to slide up them again to jump out of the window by ten past.&quot;\n\nHawke put this point to Gray after the sitting, and that officer called the caretaker aside.\n\n&quot;Mr. Blount didn&#39;t come down to get any paper,&quot; asserted the man. &quot;He&#39;d have used the house telephone, and I&#39;d have taken him one up in the lift — in a tenth of the time in which he could have come down the stairs and got back again. Besides, I tell you he never used the stairs. Mr. Meadowes must have taken the paper up.&quot;\n\n&quot;I believe,&quot; said Hawke, after the inspector had dismissed the caretaker, &quot;Meadowes said he did not go into Blount&#39;s private office, and did not know Blount was there.&quot;\n\n&quot;He did,&quot; agreed Gray.\n\n&quot;Then how did Blount come to get hold of his paper?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know that it makes an altogether overwhelming case against Meadowes, but there&#39;s certainly something that needs explaining away. Where is Meadowes?&quot;\n\nOn inquiry, they learned that Meadowes had gone.\n\nHawke and Tommy presently accompanied the Scotland Yard man to the Farringdon Street offices. Business had been suspended for the day, but there was a clerk in charge.\n\nThey made a careful inspection of the place, and Hawke examined the dictaphone machine. Several cylinders had been set on one side, but the last one to be used was identifiable by reason of the fact that it had recorded the music of the military band.\n\nThe sounds of &quot;The Entry of the Gladiators &quot; were very faint at first, but became louder, as though a window had suddenly been opened.\n\nThen a man&#39;s voice was heard — louder than the music.\n\nThe clerk identified it as Blount&#39;s voice. He appeared to have been affected by the martial spirit of the moment, for there was emotion both in the diction and in the substance of his words.\n\nHe continued speaking for a few moments, and the sounds of the music died down. Then, abruptly, the record went dead, the machine having been switched off at that point.\n\n&quot;It doesn&#39;t give us any clue to what happened,&quot; remarked Gray.\n\n&quot;No,&quot; agreed Hawke, &quot;but it gives a fairly strong hint of what didn&#39;t happen. It fixes the time, and it proves that he didn&#39;t leave this room to buy a paper. And it could only have been a second or so after he switched off that he went out of the window. Yet his remarks are not a bit like those of a man contemplating suicide, are they? I think we&#39;ll pay a visit to Meadowes.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nLooking for Trouble\n\nMeadowes lived in a small, self-contained flat at Aldgate, but he was out when the three arrived.\n\nThe hall-porter eyed them with interest when they inquired about Meadowes.\n\n&quot;He went out about half an hour ago,&quot; said the man. &quot;Said he was going to join the army.&quot;\n\n&quot;Did he give you any idea where he intended enlisting?&quot; inquired Gray.\n\n&quot;Not in words &#39;e didn&#39;t, but in deeds &#39;e did. I fancy I saw &#39;im go into the Green Man down the road, an&#39; if you ask me, about all the enlistin&#39; &#39;e&#39;ll do will be to enlist the sympathy of the landlord.&quot;\n\nThe landlord of the Green Man knew Meadowes, and he was even more interested at the mention of his name than the hall-porter at the flats had been.\n\n&quot;Yes, gentlemen,&quot; he said. &quot;Mr. Meadowes has been here, but he&#39;s been gone some little time.&quot;\n\nThe landlord was able to give the name of another tavern that Meadowes was known to visit, and the barman there had similar news about him.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s going to be no war,&quot; said the barman. &quot;That bloke&#39;s got a strangle &#39;old on the situation!&quot;\n\n&quot;Did he say he was going to join the army?&quot;\n\n&quot;No. He said he was going to invite the army to join up with him. He had a couple of drinks, and I was glad to see him go. He was in a mind for starting something. You might find him at the Duck and Drake.&quot;\n\nMeadowes had blazed a trail at the Duck and Drake. One of the attendants was clearing up broken glass, and another was supplying a customer with a piece of sticking plaster.\n\n&quot;Not a blinkin&#39; policeman in sight — as usual,&quot; said the landlord. &quot;I s&#39;pose they&#39;ve all gone on &#39;oliday. We couldn&#39;t &#39;old &#39;im. He was like a waggonload of wildcats.&quot;\n\nOther inquiries proved abortive, and the party returned to the flat.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; said the porter. &quot;He&#39;s in. His flat&#39;s number seventeen, top floor.&quot;\n\nThe visitors mounted the stairs and found the door of number seventeen slightly ajar. Entering the sitting room, they found the table strewn with short, snub-nosed bullets.\n\nMeadowes had just snapped home the breach-cover of a rather rusty Colt .45 revolver, which he pointed menacingly at the callers.\n\nIt was apparent, at first sight, that he had worked himself up to a dangerous emotional pitch, and that this condition had been further aggravated by the liquor he had taken.\n\n&quot;What do you want?&quot; he snapped.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t come near me,&quot; he added. &quot;This&#39;ll finish you. It&#39;s dangerous. It finished a lot of Germans in the last war.&quot;\n\nSome indication of his mental condition was given when he suddenly became conversational and appeared to forget his threats.\n\n&quot;An uncle of mine brought it back,&quot; he said. &quot;He was in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, at Bapaume.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said Gray, soothingly. &quot;Never mind that now. We just want to have a little talk with you.&quot;\n\nBang!\n\nGray had taken half a pace forward, and, without the slightest warning, Meadowes had fired.\n\nThe officer gasped with pain, and clapped his left hand to his right elbow.\n\nHawke saw the metal ring — the end view of the gun barrel, and he ducked and overturned the table.\n\nIt was of no avail.\n\nHe looked up to find Meadowes still standing against the wall, his wild eyes fixed unwinkingly on him, and still holding the weapon steadily, pointing it at his chest.\n\n&quot;Now tell me,&quot; said Meadowes, &quot;what it is you&#39;ve come about.&quot;\n\nHawke did some lightning thinking.\n\n&quot;I was just with my friend,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#39;s making inquiries about a street accident.&quot;\n\n&quot;Liar!&quot; shouted Meadowes. &quot;I know who you are. You&#39;re Hawke. I saw you at the inquest. You think I pushed Blount out of the window. Go on! Say what you&#39;ve got to say, and don&#39;t stall. I shall know if you&#39;re making anything up.&quot;\n\nHawke knew that there was nothing to be gained by further bluffing, so he told the exact nature of his mission in a firm, clear tone.\n\n&quot;The whole thing boils down to this,&quot; he concluded. &quot;How did Blount get his evening paper? I have since inquired at the Comet office, and have been assured that the very first copies of that edition did not come off the machine until six minutes past eight.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re as clever as the devil,&quot; said Meadowes, whose face was white and whose eyes were glittering. &quot;You &#39;re too darned clever for this world.&quot;\n\nHawke had the horror of seeing the hammer move back as Meadowes&#39; finger pressed steadily on the trigger. Meadowes went on speaking.\n\n&quot;If you want to know, he pulled it out of my pocket as he fell — &quot;\n\nBang!\n\nThe explosion was much louder than the previous one, and Hawke thought this must be due to the effect of his being shot.\n\nTo his surprise he found himself free of pain, and with no trace of any injury.\n\nThen he realised that several pictures had shattered and fallen to the floor, and that the room was filled with acrid smoke.\n\nMeadowes was lying on the floor, bleeding and unconscious.\n\nAll three visitors had had remarkable escapes, the walls all about them having been struck by the flying fragments of the burst revolver.\n\nIt had lain unused too long, and the inside of the barrel had become dangerously rusted. Doubtless the first shot had had the effect of weakening or cracking the metal.\n\nMeadowes&#39; injuries were fatal, but in the hospital he recovered consciousness and he appeared perfectly normal once more, when Hawke and Gray again interviewed him.\n\n&quot;You said old Blount had talked about me into the dictaphone, just before I bumped him off,&quot; he said, looking up at Hawke. &quot;What did he say?&quot;\n\n&quot;He said,&quot; answered Hawke, after an exchange of glances with Gray, &quot;that the band inspired him to think on broader and more generous lines about the duty of Englishmen to one another. He felt that he hadn&#39;t treated you fairly, and dictated instructions to his secretary to reinstate you at an increased salary.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

It slashed a path as if in pure berserk fury. On it rode stinging, blinding sheets of rain. Over its gusts lightning sliced jagged scars in the black heavens. Over it all was the colliding crash of thunder with the pistol-like reports of snapped-off trees puncturing it. In short, it was one hell of a night. And Charley Fringle was right smack out in it looking at the flat tire on his left forward wheel.\n\nRain water used the brim of his hat as a gutter. His coat hung on him like a wet paper bag. Water oozed from his shoes. His jack was jammed. And driving with that flat on the tortuous slick of high-crowned road was beyond all question. He hauled his pot-bellied body back to the rear door of the sedan and stuck his head in at his wife and sister-in-law.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re stuck, girls. I&#39;ll go up the line and see if I can find a telephone. Maybe a garage — &quot; The wind stuffed the rest of it back flown his throat. He sloshed off.\n\nLuck was with him. A few hundred yards on the patch of woodland ended. Set back from the road in the clearing was a sprawling white house.\n\nEven as Fringle wondered if anybody was at home, wan light seeped through the shade of a ground-floor window. He stumbled up the path hemmed in by wet shrubbery and onto the tiny porch like a cavern beneath the overhanging eaves. He pushed the bell twice with no response. A shutter on his right moaned and he almost jumped out of his skin. Lightning gashed the night and Pringle noted the window inside the shutter was broken.\n\nHe rang a third, a fourth time, then beat on the door with his fist. He took a couple of steps backward to call out, &quot;Hey, is anybody home? Is anybody — &quot; Then he realized the big front door was opening.\n\nIt was black as a pit inside beyond it. Fringle couldn&#39;t see anybody there but the door kept opening. A guarded voice said, &quot;What do you want?&quot;\n\n&quot;My car&#39;s stuck down the road and I&#39;d like to use your telephone, if you — &quot;\n\n&quot;Phone&#39;s out of order,&quot; snapped the unseen one at the door. &quot;No phone.&quot;\n\nThen the lightning Masted away the rain-shot blackness again like a magnesium explosion to reveal the figure inside. He was a little shrunken piece of man with a long sallow face and big sad eyes. A wild shock of white hair capped his head.\n\nAt first Fringle thought he had but one arm. The man stood sort of sideways, the rear arm twisted back behind his body. He stood too with his head out-thrust like a suspicious animal sniffing.\n\n&quot;Say,&quot; Fringle said in desperation. &quot;I&#39;ve got two women folk with me. Do you suppose we could come in for a little while?&quot;\n\nThe guarded air fell away from the little man.\n\n&quot;Women folk … . Why sure, sure you can come in. mister. Get &#39;em and come right along. Welcome, welcome.&quot;\n\nHis little creaking voice rose shrilly on the last.\n\nCharley Fringle groped back down the path with relief, bent against the raking sheets of rain. He never saw the hulking figure coming the other way until they collided. Both grappled blindly in the storm and almost crashed into the bushes.\n\n&quot;Why the hell don&#39;t you look where you&#39;re going?&quot; the other bigger man snorted as he punched foliage out of his face. &quot;See here, can you fix me up with a room and some dry clothes and something to eat? Charge what you like — I know what you natives are. I&#39;ll pay,&quot; he added pompously.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t own the place,&quot; Charley Fringle said apologetically, awed by the other&#39;s manner and towering size. &quot;I&#39;m stuck up the road and just stopped here myself. But the owner seems like a nice little man. He&#39;s letting me come in. So — &quot;\n\nThe other swore as the wind ripped open his rubber poncho and snorted again. &quot;I guess he&#39;ll let me in. I&#39;m J. G. Nordley — Nordley Plastic Process, you know.&quot;\n\nCharley Fringle was really awed then. Everybody knew the Nordley Plastic outfit. Million dollar stuff, that outfit. Charley thought of how when he got home he would tell the boys in the office about meeting J. G. Nordley on his trip. He put out his hand hesitantly, starting to introduce himself. There was a clap of thunder as if something had bombed Heaven and Nordley wanted to know what the devil they were waiting for.\n\nCharley Fringle told about his women down the road and led the way back to the car. Ella, his wife, stepped out and smack into six inches of puddle.\n\n&quot;You would stop right here in a small lake!&quot; she shrilled at Charley. She was a big-bosomed woman with the general air of a battleship at action stations.\n\nCharley said, &quot;Yes, dear,&quot; spat out half a gallon of rain water and searched a door pocket for his flashlight. When he found it the battery was so weak it couldn&#39;t throw a beam two feet.\n\nMaisie, Ella&#39;s sister, had spotted the extra male and was hurriedly applying fresh war paint by the tonneau light. A downpour of brimstone and ashes would have held no terrors for Maisie with a loose male on the scene. She was a dyed blond, over thirty, and thought she was kitten-ish! But when a crashing tree slapped the road a few yards behind, limbs brushing the car, she bolted out of it with a squeal like a speared pig and used some very strong language.\n\nThey slogged their way back to the house with Charley plodding ahead and locating the puddles for them by floundering into them.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nIt&#39;s Got A Sort of Haunted Look\n\n&quot;Charles!&quot; declared Ella icily, &quot;I think you might have selected a more inviting place! It&#39;s —  it&#39;s got a sort of haunted look and — &quot;\n\nShe choked. A yellow beam had shot out across the porch to their feet as they panted up the steps. It was the little man with a flashlight though he remained invisible. It might have been an unholy ray from the maw of a tomb.\n\n&#39;&#39;Come in, come in, ladies and gentlemen,&quot; his apparently disembodied voice carried weakly to them. Charley Fringle hesitated but Ella gave him a prod that sent him stumbling over the threshold. &quot;Go right into the library. Into the library, down the hall to the left,&quot; said the little man with that dry echo of a voice. The hall was pitch black.\n\nThe four fumbled their way along and found their way into the library. It was a high-ceiled old-fashioned room, the walls panelled halfway up. The light from two small table lamps alone broke the dimness of it. The shades were drawn at all windows with heavy drapes pulled across as well. There was a constant drip-drip sound. It came from the fireplace where water drained down the chimney into the charred logs of a long-dead fire.\n\nNordley shed his poncho and hat and strode around in an expensive pair of slacks and a windbreaker, massaging his hands. They were huge big-knuckled things, those hands, furred with hair. He had been at a fishing camp way up at the head of the valley, he told all and sundry. Started out down the river with a guide in the boat. Late in the afternoon, the guide wanted to put into shore, insisting a big storm was coming up.\n\n&quot;I got tired of arguing with him, put him ashore and fired him on the spot,&quot; Nordley announced importantly, He had come on alone. The storm hit him. He was capsized in a shallow spot and waded ashore. He had pushed up the side of the valley until he found Fringle and this house.\n\n&quot;Which proves my point,&quot; he snorted. &quot;If that damfool guide hadn&#39;t lost his nerve, with two men paddling, we&#39;d have made it through easily!&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course, Mr. Nordley,&quot;. yesmanned Charley Fringle.\n\n&quot;You outdoor men simply awe little me, Mr. Nordley.&quot; simpered sister-in-law Maisie.\n\n&quot;Nice night for a murder, isn&#39;t it?&quot;\n\nTheir host stood in the doorway, rubbing his long white hands together gently with a slithering sound. He wore baggy black clothes that seemed a couple of sizes too big for him.\n\n&quot;Nonsense,&quot; snorted Nordley, &quot;no murderer would come out on a night like this! My man, how about getting together some food for us and something to drink — something hot maybe.&quot;\n\nThe little man bowed his shock of white hair, closed his sad eyes. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry. But the servants are off tonight.&quot;\n\n&quot;Charley, I&#39;m cold. This place is like a grave,&quot; announced Ella Fringle, huddled on the divan. She shuddered as the wind seemed to rock the house. Lightning licked at the windows, seeming to make the shades transparent.\n\n&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; said Charley. &quot;Uh —  Mister — uh — mis — &quot;\n\n&quot;Reaper is the name,&quot; said the little man.\n\n&quot;Grim Reaper, eh? Ha-ha!&quot; snorted Nordley.\n\n&quot;He-he,&quot; said Mr. Reaper. &quot;I&#39;ll remember that.&quot;\n\n&quot;Could we have a fire, Mr. Reaper? Maybe if I helped you — uh — well — &quot; Charley stumbled.\n\nMr. Reaper ran a sorrowful eye up the chimney. &#39;&#39;I&#39;m sorry — but — but there was some trouble with the chimney last week. It hasn&#39;t been fixed yet. But — maybe you&#39;d like a drink, a nice stiff one.&quot;\n\nHe winked knowingly.\n\n&quot;One to keep the worms out of the coffin. Yes.&quot;\n\nHe moved across the room, picking up their wet coats en route, and went out a door leading to the rear. He didn&#39;t make any noise when he walked.\n\n&quot;What does he mean, keep the worms out of the coffin?&quot; Nordley snorted. He tapped his forehead significantly. &quot;Weak-minded, probably. A harmless old fool — Say, this place is kind of creepy. I — &quot;\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s have some music!&quot; said Maisie, jumping up with feigned vivacity. &quot;Let&#39;s have a party! Drinks and music. We&#39;ll probably shock the old coot out of his shoes. Let&#39;s cut a rug, boys and girls!&quot; She undulated over to the radio. &quot;I&#39;ll bet you shake a mean rhumba, Mr. Nordley.&quot;\n\nShe twisted the dials and found a swing band. A crooner was holding forth on &quot;Black Magic.&quot; Pouting her over-carmined lips in what she thought was a provocative manner, Maisie held out her arms to Mr. Nordley.\n\n&quot;Sit down, Charley,&quot; snapped Ella Fringle. &quot;You know you can&#39;t do anything but waltz like a sick cow. You — &quot;\n\n&quot;One moment please, folks,&quot; said the station announced, interrupting the music. &quot;A special news flash has just come in — Warning to all residents in the Piscan Valley district. … Warning — &quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right here where we are, Charley,&quot; said Ella.\n\n&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; said Charley.\n\n&quot;Warning,&quot; went on the radio. &quot;Joseph &#39;Death&#39; Mantas, homicidal maniac, escaped today while being taken to the State Insane Asylum when the car in which he and officers were riding struck a tree. Death Mantas dragged the unconscious officer, to whom he was handcuffed, off into the woods and killed him. The police of two counties and State officers have thrown out a dragnet but, as yet, have picked up no trace of the maniac killer. Mantas is well armed. I repeat that, ladies and gentlemen … . Death Mantas is well armed. He was nicknamed &#39;Death&#39; because he is prone to talk about it as he is about to strike down a victim. Now here is an official police teletype description of Death Mantas. He — &quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Lights Went Out\n\nThat bolt of lightning seemed to knife right through the sides of the houses. There was an ear-shattering crash of thunder that rattled the roof over them. And the lights went out. Just before they did, Charley Fringle saw Mr. Reaper standing in the doorway with a tray of drinks in one hand. He was standing twisted a little around with the rear arm out of sight behind him as he had been when Charley first came to the house.\n\nMaisie screeched.\n\nNordley roared, &quot;Where&#39;s my leather jacket? I had a gun in it,&quot; forgetting that their host had taken their wet garments into the kitchen with him.\n\nThe lights flickered and then came on. Mr. Reaper was standing over by the radio. He stooped and fussed with the dials and nothing happened. Mr. Reaper made an impotent gesture.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m afraid that last bolt blew out something in the radio,&quot; he said sadly. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry. But, come now. We&#39;ll all have a nice drink. There&#39;s nothing to worry about. You know, folks, the old saying.&quot; He moved around, passing the drinks and smiling childishly. &quot;Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we may die. He-he.&quot;\n\nChatley Fringle shuddered. They were just getting their glasses to their mouths when the pounding came at the front door. Ella Fringle gave a little gasp and fell back on the divan. Maisie grabbed Nordley&#39;s arm. Charley Fringle looked around wildly, and then grabbed up the poker from beside the fireplace. The pounding came again, with redoubled force above the wind. Mr. Reaper, rubbing his pale hands softly, had glided to the very back of the room.\n\nThere was a sudden lull in the storm and Nordley bellowed, &quot;Wh-who&#39;s out there?&quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s me, Ed Purling, police officer from the town!&quot; came from the porch. &quot;Half drowned, too! I got — &quot;\n\nThe wind sucked .away the rest.\n\nNobody moved for a moment. Nordley stood with his huge hands working, fingers hooking up. Then Charley Fringle saw his wife nod and went out into the hall to the door.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nPlumb Forgot My Badge\n\nPurling came striding in, a big man in an olive-green slicker gleaming with rain. His face fell when he saw no fire in the hearth.\n\n&quot;Been out watching the roads for that escaped homicidal killer, Mantas,&quot; he said as he got out of his coat. He wasn&#39;t a tall man but was built like a bull with a heavy torso. He looked as if he could break a human being over his knee. He went on telling how a tree was down across the road and he couldn&#39;t get through to town. But the others in the room scarcely heard. Their eyes were locked on his armament as he unpeeled an undercoat. He had a gun in a hip holster, another rigged in a shoulder sling. The butt of a third protruded from a rear pocket.\n\nHe stared around slowly, studying them. Charley Fringle took a step backward instinctively when he was the target for those eyes. One of them had a cast in it that gave it a peculiarly wild look.\n\nPurling said, &quot;All strangers, eh…. Well, don&#39;t worry. Like I said, I&#39;m the police officer from Wakill. My badge — &#39;&#39; He pulled his coat back from his flannel shirt to indicate it. The shirt was bare of ornament. Purling looked down and chuckled. That chuckle had a nasty cold ring to it. &quot;Heck of a policeman I am. Plumb forgot my badge … &quot;\n\nElla Fringle caught her breath with a trembling gasp. Charley Fringle looked around to where he had laid down the poker six feet away.\n\n&quot;All strangers,&quot; said Purling again. &quot;Say, where&#39;s Joe Bannard? The owner, I mean. I saw him take a train to the city this morning. But he said he&#39;d be back tonight and — &quot;\n\n&quot;He&#39;s drunk,&quot; said Mr. Reaper gently.\n\n&quot;He — what-t? Say, I never saw Joe take more&#39;n one drink in my life. Why — &quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nA Little Prayer\n\nMr. Reaper smiled in a vague way, tittering a little.\n\n&quot;You&#39;ve never been with Joe when he gets to the city, I guess, Officer. You should have heard him on the phone tonight  — that was before it went out of commission … .&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh.&quot; Purling whistled with surprise. A fresh onslaught of rain hit the side of the house like machine gun fire. &quot;You&#39;re a friend of his, I reckon.&quot;\n\nMr. Reaper inclined his white head.\n\n&quot;Speaking of drinks, I think you better have one to stave off a cold. A man has one foot in the grave when he catches a cold.&quot;\n\nHe came forward, offering his own glass.\n\nMaisie let out a little scream.\n\n&quot;I thought I heard someone at the window,&quot; she half sobbed, on the verge of hysteria.\n\nNordley scowled at Mr. Reaper.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ve got women here! Do you have to sound like an undertaker every time you open your mouth, man?&quot;\n\nMr. Reaper said he was very sorry.\n\nPurling guffawed. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, folks, I&#39;m here even if I ain&#39;t got my badge. Or maybe some of you got me figured for that Mantas guy, huh? Har-har!&quot;\n\nNordley had moved over beside the fire poker Charley Fringle had laid on the scuttle on the hearth.\n\n&quot;Haha! Why I could be Mantas, myself. I could have just said I was on a fishing trip. And, after all, I can&#39;t identify myself since I lost my wallet when the boat capsized. I — hey, Reaper, what was that noise in the kitchen? The back door locked?&quot;\n\n&quot;Charley — do something!&quot; sniffed Ella Fringle.\n\n&quot;Let us keep calm, everybody, please,&quot; said Mr. Reaper. &quot;Perhaps if we all said a little prayer — &quot;\n\nElla Fringle nodded eagerly.\n\n&quot;Yes, yes. That&#39;s a good idea.&quot;\n\nShe signed to Charley and he nodded.\n\nMr. Reaper laid a hand on his chest.\n\n&quot;Dear Lord God above,&quot; he began. A long-drawn rumble of thunder blotted out his voice. &quot; — and we who walk in the valley of death,&quot; his words came through as the thunder ebbed, &quot;shall have no fear.&quot;\n\nHe asked the Almighty to look over them for they were sinners who had sinned. They were not worthy but could God, in his great mercy, spare them from the destruction and damnation of His righteous anger, Mr. Reaper said. They were but the sons of mortals, doomed to return to the bowels of the earth when they had come, but would praise Him with their last breath, Mr. Reaper promised.\n\nIt was a nice prayer but a little depressing.\n\n&quot;Ashes to ashes and dust to dust,&quot; Mr. Reaper concluded, &quot;Thy will be done. We — &quot;\n\nThere was a blow on the front door.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nYou Who Are About To Die —\n\nNordley grabbed up the poker. Then they heard a key scrape, the rasp of the lock.\n\n&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; roared Purling, hand on a gun butt.\n\n&quot;&#39;S me, Joe Bannard, Ed!&quot; the man at the door .ailed as he stumbled in with a blast of wind on his heels. The door slammed. He came down the hall and into the room, a tall, gaunt man with rain sluicing from his clothes as he pulled off his gloves.\n\n&quot;Saw your car, Ed, at the other side of the down tree that blocked me. Walked up the rest of the way. Some night. Whew!&quot;\n\nHe seemed very sober as he surveyed the rest of them.\n\n&quot;You folks got stuck, too, eh? All right. But whoever busted that window on the porch to get in — he&#39;s got to reimburse me for it!&quot; His thin lips pursed up. &quot;Really tain&#39;t legal to bust into a man&#39;s house under any conditions or — &quot;\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t think none of these folks broke the window, Joe,&quot; Ed Purling said. &quot;Your friend, Mr. Reaper, let them in.&quot;\n\nCharley Fringle had looked at Reaper before and seen him standing in that half-twisted-around way over by the radio. He had also noted subconsciously, without realizing what it meant at the moment, that the plug of the radio connection hung down from the wall socket.\n\n&quot;My friend, Mr. Reaper?&quot; Bannard said, puzzled. &quot;Why I don&#39;t know anybody by that — &quot; He looked to where Phrling pointed at the whitehaired man.\n\nThey all looked. They looked right into the slow-swiveling muzzles of the .45 automatics in the co-called Mr. Reaper&#39;s hands. Mr. Reaper was snickering crazily and his sad eyes were suddenly glassy with a mad light.\n\nPurling choked.\n\n&quot;Gawd help me, they said that Mantas was whitehaired!&quot;\n\nDeath Mantas&#39; flaccid lips curled back from his teeth in the grin of a death&#39;s-head. &quot;Ashes to ashes.. .dust to dust.&quot; he cackled. &quot;You who are about to die — &quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n\n\n\nThe taller of the two detectives, the one named Sergeant Slake, said, &quot;Tell me, Professor Johnson, did your wife buy any new clothes shortly before she ran away?&quot;\n\nI said, &quot;Not that I know.&quot;\n\n&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you know?&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course,&quot; I said. &quot;She hasn&#39;t bought any clothing for at least two months.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then we ought to be able to figure what she wore that night. When you renewed your fire insurance last month, she made a written inventory of all the items in each room, and we have a list of every piece of clothing she owned. Even her handkerchiefs. Your wife&#39;s a methodical woman.&quot;\n\nI said, &quot;Yes, she always … is.&quot;\n\nSergeant Slake&#39;s companion, who had not introduced himself, glanced at me and started to ask another question, but changed his mind.\n\nThe express company men came at that moment and I excused myself in order to direct them to the three book crates in my study. Sergeant Slake followed along behind us and waited in the doorway.\n\nOne of the express men was new, but the other was the same heavy-shouldered and heavy-humored man who came for my books every summer, and who seemed to delight in getting under my skin.\n\nHe said to his partner, &quot;Some guys carry a book when they travel. The prof here carries a library.&quot;\n\nHitching up his pants, he expanded his annual theme just as though I were not present.\n\n&quot;Every summer these same three crates goes up to his farm, and every fall they comes back. Once I asked him why he read the same books over and over, and know what he says ? He says, &#39;These books ain&#39;t for readin&#39;.&quot;\n\nThe muscled humorist grunted as he stooped to lift one end of the first crate.\n\nThe detective in the doorway was grinning at me.\n\nI said testily, &quot;It&#39;s a reference library. I&#39;m doing research. There are books in the world aside from dime novels.&quot;\n\nFrom the corner of my eye I caught the express man winking at the detective and felt a furious contempt for clodhoppers who condescend to anyone who works with his mind.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll show you my wife&#39;s room,&quot; I told Sergeant Slake coldly.\n\nWhen I had taken the two detectives to Martha&#39;s room and indicated her closet.\n\nI went to my own bedroom to complete packing. I had nearly finished when a knock came at the door.\n\nI said, &quot;Come in,&quot; and the door opened to admit Elizabeth.\n\nFrowning at her, I said sharply, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be here. The police are in the next room.&quot;\n\nHer Dresden-china face developed a look of hurt surprise.\n\n&quot;Why, Don darling, what difference does that make?&quot;\n\n&quot;Just the difference between avoiding suspicion and unnecessarily arousing it!&quot;\n\nI was conscious my voice was ragged, and brought myself up short.\n\nMore reasonably I said, &quot;After all, Martha has run off, and if people began to combine that with a sudden increase in familiarity between the head of the English department and the school librarian, there could be a juicy campus scandal.&quot;\n\nHer red lips thrust out petulantly. &quot;I thought you&#39;d appreciate some help packing. Sorry I&#39;m a bother.&quot;\n\nShe turned to leave, but I caught her shoulder and swung her around into my arms.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t be such a goose, darling,&quot; I said. &quot;We&#39;ll see each other all summer. Why take a chance on scandal for the sake of an extra five minutes?&quot;\n\nShe held her head down, avoiding my lips, and I said, &quot;If Martha has gone to Reno, we may even be free to marry by fall. Then we can do away with all this secrecy.&quot;\n\nImmediately the petulance smoothed from her face. She said, &quot;Oh, Don! Do you think she has?&quot;\n\n&quot;There, or somewhere to get a divorce. She seemed to want one badly enough, and though she wouldn&#39;t say. I&#39;m sure she ran off like this because she learned about us somehow.&quot;\n\nA knock sounded, and I quickly stepped back to the bed, bent over my suitcase as though busy packing and called, &quot;Yes?&quot;\n\nThe tall detective came in and glanced curiously at Elizabeth.\n\nI said, &quot;This is Sergeant Slake of the detective bureau, Miss Crane.&quot; Then to the sergeant, &quot;Miss Crane is our school librarian.&quot;\n\nThe detective said, &quot;We&#39;ve met.&quot;\n\nIn a polite voice I said, &quot;Thanks for dropping in, Miss Crane. Have a nice vacation. See you in the fall.&quot;\n\nKnowing very well she would see me a hundred miles from there in the morning, Elizabeth smiled slightly, gave both of us an impersonal good-by and turned to leave.\n\n&quot;Just a minute,&quot; said Sergeant Slake. &quot;I may want to talk to you when I finish with Professor Johnson … . Let&#39;s go over things once more, Professor. Your story is that last Wednesday your wife suddenly announced she wanted a divorce, refused to give any reason and refused to listen to your remonstrances. You left for an evening class without settling the discussion, and when you returned, she was gone.&quot;\n\nI pushed down my suitcase lid and latched it.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s substantially correct.&quot;\n\n&quot;When she didn&#39;t come home all night, you phoned some of your friends and learned none of them had seen her. One of the friends was Miss Crane here. Two days passed, and then Miss Crane mentioned it to the campus policeman, who passed it on to us and we dropped around just in time to catch you before you took off for the summer. Apparently we&#39;d never have heard about it otherwise, since you didn&#39;t seem in any hurry to make a report.&quot;\n\nI said coldly, &quot;I hardly considered it a police matter — and still don&#39;t. It&#39;s a personal thing between my wife and myself.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure, Professor. Except no one seen her leave town, and Wednesday morning, just a few hours before your argument about divorce, she talked to Prof. Staley&#39;s wife on the phone and was full of plans about you and her spending the summer together on that farm you own. I just took a second gander at your study and your book shelves are still about a third full.&quot;\n\nI snapped my eyes up at him. &quot;What&#39;s that irrelevant remark supposed to mean ?&quot;\n\n&quot;Why, I thought you&#39;d catch on right away, Professor,&quot; the detective said. &quot;We checked the list of her clothing, and there&#39;s nothing missing. Nothing at all. Not even a pair of stockings. Does your wife run around naked, Professor ?&quot;\n\nI felt my forehead dampen and shifted my eyes from the detective to Elizabeth.\n\nHer expression was puzzled, and Sergeant Stake&#39;s was suddenly cynical.\n\nHe said, &quot;Remember when I remarked your wife was methodical ? You said, &#39;Yes, she always … is.&#39; What you started to say was, &#39;She always was.&#39; I don&#39;t speak very good English myself, but my partner&#39;s a college man. He says an English professor wouldn&#39;t start to use the past tense unless he knew it was correct.&quot;\n\nCrossing to the phone extension by my bed, he leafed through the book and dialed a number. &quot;Think we&#39;ll have a look at those book crates,&quot; he said.\n\nElizabeth continued to look puzzled.\n\n&quot;What is it, Don?&quot; she asked.\n\nI opened my mouth to reply, but was seized by a violent attack of trembling.\n\n&quot;Hello,&quot; the detective said into the phone. &quot;This the express company?&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  What&#39;s My Assignment?\n  The Room Was A Din\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nWhat&#39;s My Assignment?\n\nHodgson, leaner than ever in black dinner clothes, went down past the gleaming bar to where the singer lounged at a table near the band-shell. The colored band was on, and she was drumming idly on the cloth with a little wooden noise-maker in time to the pulsing strains of You Walk Like My Man.\n\nHodgson stopped at the table. The girl looked up with the leisurely insolence of pretty women who must be nice to drunks.\n\n&quot;Mind if I sit down?&quot; Hodgson said.\n\nThe girl said in a bored baritone: &quot;I don&#39;t mind if you fall down.&quot;\n\nHer hand, with its incredibly long nails, went on tapping with the little wooden hammer.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s damn white of you,&quot; Hodgson said in an indifferent voice. He pulled out a gilt chair, sat in it &quot;Well, I see you&#39;re still alive.&quot;\n\nHis low murmur brought the girl&#39;s head up. Her eyes were extraordinary. Their slanting length was no trick of makeup, the startled look that lifted her sleepy lashes showed that clearly.\n\n&quot;Oh!&quot; she said. &quot;I didn&#39;t — &quot;\n\n&quot;Skip it,&quot; Hodgson said. &quot;I&#39;m not hurt.&quot; He leaned forward, lowered his voice again. &quot;Well — I&#39;m working for you. What&#39;s my assignment?&quot;\n\n&quot;This isn&#39;t a regular detective job I called you about,&quot; she said. &quot;I mean it&#39;s not a dead body and a lot of clues and all that book stuff.&quot;\n\n&quot;Most of &#39;em aren&#39;t&quot; Hodgson said. &quot;I got that much over the phone. You want me to keep you from getting killed, right? Who do you think&#39;s going to kill you? And w hat do you want me to start doing right now&#39;?&quot;\n\nThe band finished the set of dances, made way for the white combination. A trumpet blew &quot;A&quot;. The singer smoothed the satin that was a sheath from high bosom to flat waist.\n\n&quot;I — I don&#39;t know,&quot; she said, bewildered. &quot;You see, they probably wouldn&#39;t do it themselves.\n\nThey&#39;d send somebody. And listen.&quot; She put a warm palm on the back of his hand. &quot;You can&#39;t stay here. Talking to me, I mean.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why?&quot;\n\n&quot;Because — &quot;\n\nThe band burst into a slow introduction. The girl got to her feet hastily.\n\n&quot;This is my number. I&#39;ve got to go.&quot; She came so close to him he could see the powdered hollow of her bodice, smell the heavy perfume of her hair. &quot;Go talk to the tap-dancer. Don&#39;t come near — &quot;\n\nThe leader pointed his trumpet at her and blew an irritated riff in her direction. She hurried to the bandstand, loosened the thumbscrew on the mike stand, and lifted it close to her curved lips just in time to start the song.\n\nHer voice was incredibly low — deep and hoarse as a man&#39;s, but with a vibrant huskiness that was all woman — and passionate woman, moreover. The draped lines of the evening gown, falling in long silken flutings from her lithe hips made her seem even taller than she was. She moved her body in rhythm, with an almost imperceptible rocking motion, and sometimes, when she moved her glistening lips close to the microphone, she let the curtains of her lashes fall over her long tip-tilted eyes.\n\nEven the waiters stopped to watch her work. Hodgson looked around, saw a girl in a bellhop costume, short skirt, and patent-leather pumps. He moved aside and back, whispered: &quot;That better?&quot; as if he had been interfering with her view.\n\nShe smiled thanks and watched the singer. Hodgson&#39;s shoulder was brushing hers in the darkness where she stood peering on tiptoe. He tried again, in a casual whisper:\n\n&quot;She&#39;s really terrific, isn&#39;t she?&quot;\n\nThe dancer nodded, not looking around.\n\n&quot;She makes me want to go out and — &quot; The spell-bound look in her eyes made words unnecessary.\n\nThe singer, eyes closed, was holding the mike standard to her breast, and the look on her face could have been pain — or ecstasy. The crowd was hushed. A sharp-featured man at a table in the spotlight wet his lips. Hodgson looked down at the little tap-dancer. Her slender body moved with the singer&#39;s. Her youthful face held the same swooning recklessness.\n\nThe song ended in a burst of applause. Hodgson, clapping, smiled at the dancer. The lights went up, the singer came down from the band-shell, drapes swirling. Hodgson said casually to the dancer: &quot;What&#39;re you drinking?&quot;\n\nShe looked swiftly at him. The heavy tan stage makeup made a mask of her face.\n\n&quot;Whiskey and soda?&quot; she said.\n\nHodgson called a waiter, gave the order, and sat down at the dancer&#39;s table with an expression of complete disinterest — detachment, almost.\n\nThe dancer stood it for a few minutes.\n\n&quot;Musician — are you?&quot;\n\n&quot;No more. I used to play drums, but I didn&#39;t like the hours.&quot;\n\n&quot;I suppose a big fellow like you needs plenty of sleep.&quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s not that. Who wants to be up there pushing a bass-drum pedal when all the fun&#39;s going on?&quot;\n\n&quot;What fun?&quot; she said.\n\nThe waiter brought drinks.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t you have fun?&quot;\n\nShe poured in Scotch, stirred it without looking up.\n\n&quot;Who, me?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why, is there fun? I must be missing something.&quot;\n\nHodgson said, spacing the words: &quot;Maybe … you … are.&quot;\n\nShe looked up and the tip of a red tongue came out to wet her lips. &quot;And what would you suggest I do about it?&quot;\n\n&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;\n\n&quot;Judy. What&#39;s yours?&quot;\n\n&quot;Mother wanted Kurt but father held out for Mike.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, Mike, what should I — ?&quot;\n\nTaffeta swished. A woman&#39;s hearty voice said: &quot;Well, Mike Hodgson I At it again! Isn&#39;t it the limit, Asa, how they get prettier and prettier, too?&quot;\n\nHodgson stood up to bend in sly courtliness over the heavily-ringed hand of the brisk, daringly-gowned woman eyeing him with fond amusement. The heavy-set distinguished man with her smiled.\n\n&quot;How are you, Hodgson?&quot; He shook hands.\n\nThe woman turned to the dancer.\n\n&quot;Could we borrow him for just a moment, dear? I&#39;ll send him right back.&quot; She smiled. &quot;Handsome devil, isn&#39;t he? I&#39;d&#39;ve fallen for him myself if Mr. Wheelock&#39;d&#39;ve given me permission.&quot; She looked fondly at her husband.\n\nThe dancer said: &quot;Oh, that&#39;s all right.&quot;\n\nAt the Wheelock&#39;s table, Mrs. Wheelock slid a flat case under the table to Hodgson.\n\n&quot;I want you to mind this for me,&quot; she said. &quot;I know you did good work for us on the pearls — getting them back when even the insurance companies had failed. But this is really important. I&#39;m wearing the paste collar, and the one I&#39;ve just given you is the real one. I just discovered I&#39;d brought it along in my bag by mistake. The police told me not to wear my best pieces while this gang is still operating. Be awfully careful of it, Mike, won&#39;t you?&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure. How&#39;d it get in your bag?&quot;\n\n&quot;Damfino. I don&#39;t remember putting it in, though the maid said something to me about the clasp being loose. I was going to take it to the jeweler&#39;s and I may have stuck it in there absentmindly.&quot;\n\nHodgson stood up.\n\n&quot;Wearing that paste collar was just as bad,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#39;ll finger you for it, and you know these boys aren&#39;t above shooting. I don&#39;t mind recovering jewelry for you — that&#39;s what you pay me for. But I don&#39;t want to see you knocked off just to satisfy a little silly vanity.&quot;\n\n&quot;You see, Asa? He talks to me as if I were a child. Well, Mike, run back to your little friend. She&#39;s absolutely lovely, Mike. Known her long?&quot;\n\n&quot;Not long enough. When do you want this?&quot;\n\n&quot;Bring it around tomorrow&#39;ll be all right. Or can you give it to Mr. Geary at Black Starr and tell him to fix the clasp.&quot;\n\nBack at the table the dancer looked up from her drink. Hodgson sat down.\n\n&quot;When do you go on?&quot;\n\nThe girl said: &quot;Excuse me,&quot; and got up and went over to the bar. She stood there talking and laughing with a party. When it became obvious she was not coming back, Hodgson went over to the singer&#39;s table.\n\n&quot;What&#39;m I supposed to do now? The babe ran out on me. Can&#39;t you give me some idea of what this is all about? Who do you think&#39;s going to kill you? And why do you want me to play with the tap-dancer?&quot;\n\n&quot;Damn you, Hodgson!&quot; she said between her teeth. &quot;I told you to stay away from me! Do you want to get us both killed? And go after that girl — or you&#39;ll get me killed! Make love to her, fondle her, act as if you were nuts about her. And in the third I had Ruffnreddy and know what a mudder that nag is, and my little parlay just — &quot;\n\n&quot;Have you gone nuts? What the — ?&quot;\n\nA man&#39;s voice behind him said: &quot;Toni, I want to speak to you about your next number a sec.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Room Was A Din\n\n\n\t\n\tHe started to get shakily to his feet and something like a sack of sand fell on him, knocking him to the floor.\n\n\n\n\nHodgson turned, saw a thick-set man with black curly hair, a beetling scowl. Hodgson looked at the girl. Her face, under the rouge, had gone white. She took the man&#39;s arm.\n\n&quot;Sam darling! Listen, will you make the boys play softer behind me on my Fog number?&quot; She turned carelessly to Hodgson, said in a tone of utter indifference: &quot;&#39;Bye.&quot; Her eyes, wide with fright, gave him a swift, intense look, and turned away.\n\nHodgson went through the tables toward the bar. A full-bosomed redhead in blue, looking off to one side, bumped into him and turned snarling: &quot;Why the hell don&#39;t you look where you&#39;re going, you dope!&quot;\n\nHodgson apologized, looked puzzled after the red-head. The dancer left the bar, went down toward the bandstand. Hodgson was in her path.\n\nShe looked up, saw him, said: &quot;Oh, hello,&quot; and started to pass on.\n\nHodgson reached out, took her hand, put a hand on her shoulder. &quot;Hey listen, Judy — &quot;\n\n&quot;What?&quot;\n\n&quot;Who&#39;s that guy with the black hair talking to the singer?&quot;\n\n&quot;You mean Sam Klaub? He&#39;s the boss.&quot;\n\n&quot;And the red-head I just bumped into. See, over there? The woman watching them?&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s Mae Klaub, Sam&#39;s wife.&quot; Her tone was cold.\n\nHodgson said : &quot;And I have a compliment for you. Mrs. Wheelock, that woman that spoke to me remember? I used to work for her — well, she said you were absolutely lovely.&quot;\n\n&quot;What is this?&quot;\n\nThe music was soft. Hodgson looked in the girl&#39;s eyes and said: &quot;That&#39;s right. Who am I to argue with her?&quot;\n\nShe pulled her shoulder away. Hodgson held her. A waiter put a piece of paper into his hand. He opened it, read:\n\n&quot;You must do as I tell you. Make love to the dancer and stay away from me. If you see anybody watching me too closely, get close to them in case they pull a gun.&quot;\n\nHodgson, crumpling the note and pushing it into his coat pocket, caught the girl&#39;s eyes on his face. He said carelessly: &quot;Somebody touting a horse to me.&quot;\n\nJudy came so close to him he could see the powder at the edges of her blond hair. &quot;Who are you, anyway, Mike?&quot;\n\n&quot;Just a guy.&quot;\n\nShe studied him. The music soared. She said, low-voiced: &quot;Did you really mean what you were saying back there about me — missing something, I mean?&quot;\n\nHer slender figure rubbed against him like a cat&#39;s. Her fingers squeezed his. She looked at him in wordless understanding.\n\n&quot;I got to run upstairs to my dressing-room. It&#39;s all right. You can come along.&quot;\n\nIt was a long room with a powder-dusted dressing table, costumes on hooks, a day couch. She closed the door behind them very slowly.\n\n&quot;Lock it,&quot; Hodgson said.\n\n&quot;Why?&quot; She locked it, came over. &quot;Why did you want me to — ?&quot; Hodgson reached out and took her in his arms.\n\nHer lips murmured under his. Her hands moved over his back. She went limp in his arms, her knees like water, sank back to the divan. &quot;Oh, Mike — !&quot;\n\nA gun went off in the street.\n\nHodgson jumped up, ran to the door, unlocked it, and pounded down the carpeted stairs. People were milling through the entrance. He shouldered through them, ran up the glaring cement walk to where Wheelock, his opera hat crushed under his head grotesquely, lay gasping in a pool of blood. On her knees beside him, her throat raked with raw scratches, Mrs. Wheelock was sobbing: &quot;Oh, darling, oh, can&#39;t somebody — ?&quot;\n\nHodgson bent over the wounded man.\n\n&quot;Who shot you? Do you know me, Wheelock?&quot;\n\nBlood bubbled on Wheelock&#39;s lips. He strained, fell back.\n\nMrs. Wheelock shrieked: &quot;He&#39;s dead!&quot; and fell over in a faint. A policeman lifted her.\n\nHodgson looked around: &quot;Who saw this, anybody?&quot;\n\nA cab-driver said: &quot;It was two guys wid caps. Dey run up, grabbed de necklace off de lady&#39;s neck and de guy, here, tries to stop &#39;em and makes a pass for one and de guy shoots him and dey both beat it down dat way.&quot;\n\nHodgson looked down the dark street with its maze of alleys, dark hallways, vacant lots. He walked down, examining the sidewalk. Up at the corner a dark cross street led left and right. The left was brighter than the right. He turned right, down the cross-street.\n\nHe asked everybody he met: &quot;See a couple of men go past here?&quot;\n\nPeople looked at him, shook their heads.\n\nAt the next comer a stout man in shirtsleeves was exercising a dog. Hodgson asked him the same question. The man laughed.\n\n&quot;Hell, guy, there&#39;s men going by here all night long!&quot;\n\nHodgson thought. The man with the dog turned away.\n\n&quot;Wait!&quot;\n\nThe man said: &quot;Huh?&quot;\n\n&quot;These guys&#39;d be looking back,&quot; Hodgson said.\n\n&quot;Oh, them guys! Yeh, I seen them. They went up that way. Half-running, was they?&quot;\n\n&quot;Probably. Thanks!&quot; Hodgson broke into a run.\n\nThe street carried him to the avenue again, past an alley that ran back through to the club. Hodgson went down to the corner. No one there had seen the fugitives pass.\n\nHe went back, questioned the man with the dog. He could learn only that the fugitives wore no caps, and that one of them &quot;kept holding on to his throat, like.&quot;\n\nIn front of the club the crowd had scattered except for a handful of newcomers asking questions about the blood. Hodgson went inside.\n\nThe band was blasting away, trying to give the impression nothing had happened. The black-haired proprietor, Sam, was gesticulating with cops at the bar. A waiter came up.\n\n&quot;You Mr. Hodgson?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re wanted upstairs. Telephone. On the landing.&quot;\n\nHodgson went up the wide stair, down the empty corridor and found the telephone booth. The receiver was hung up. He scowled, came out.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll take the jewel case, bud,&quot; a voice said behind him. Something hard poked him over the kidney.\n\nHodgson stiffened. &quot;Guess the rod talks,&quot; he said resignedly. &quot;Here y&#39;are.&quot;\n\nHe turned slowly, making no sudden moves, unbuttoned his jacket, reached inside, and brought out the case, handed it over.\n\nThe man with the gun was a beefy sandy-haired youth in his late twenties. He put out a big hand for the case, closed his fingers around it.\n\nHodgson put his hands up level with his ears. He cringed, eyes on the gun, less than a foot from his belt.\n\nThe red-headed thug slid the jewel case inside his breast pocket. His mind was on the case, not the gun.\n\nHodgson slapped both hands down hard, twisted sidewise, away from the crashing pistol. His left, at the man&#39;s wrist, swept the pistol away from his body. His right, higher, caught the forearm as in a swift, crossing scissors, turning the arm, knocking it aside.\n\nThe man dropped the pistol.\n\nHodgson stepped in and hit him with everything he had behind the punch — six inches above the man&#39;s belt.\n\nThe man doubled, swayed.\n\nA shot crashed.\n\nHodgson spun. Down the corridor a pimply youth with a shock of wiry hair was squinting over a heavy automatic for a second try at Hodgson. Hodgson flung himself down, fumbling for the pistol at his arm-pit. He got clear and shot just as the pimply-faced youth&#39;s bullet tore a furrow in the carpet at his head.\n\nThe red-head aimed a glancing kick at his head and stooped for the gun on the carpet. Hodgson kept his gun on the pimply-faced youth, fired and saw the youth&#39;s gun drop, saw him put a hand to his belly and pitch froward on his face. The redhead scooped up the pistol near Hodgson&#39;s feet.\n\nHodgson tried to swing his own gun over. The red-head saw it coming and lashed out with a heavy boot that knocked it from Hodgson&#39;s hand. Hodgson, on his knees, tried to run on them over to the pistol. He fell on it, twisted, swung it around. A gun crashed over his head. He shot blindly.\n\nSomething dropped heavily to the carpet. He started to get shakily to his feet and something like a sack of sand fell on him, knocking him to the floor. He pushed the red-head&#39;s body off him, got to his feet and looked down at the sprawling gunman.\n\nThe jewel-case had fallen half out of the man&#39;s pocket. Hodgson picked it up, went down the corridor, putting his gun away.\n\nA cop with a drawn gun met him on the stairs. &quot;Stop!&quot;\n\nHodgson stopped.\n\n&quot;Couple bandits up there tried to stick me up,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ll give you the pinches — if they live, that is.&quot;\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll just have a look at &#39;em,&quot; the cop said.\n\n&quot;Sleepy Willie and Joe the Butcher! Well, well! A nice bag. They&#39;re dead, all right. You bring &#39;em both down yourself?&quot;\n\nHodgson nodded, gave him the story. The cop called in. Hodgson went downstairs, telling him: &quot;Stick around. I&#39;m going to break this thing now.&quot;\n\nThe band was blasting — open horns, din enough to drown a firing squad. Hodgson looked around for the singer. She was sitting at her table, a long cigarette holder in her lips, pointed fingers toying with a packet of paper matches.\n\nA rough-looking man came out of the kitchen, looked around, and started for her.\n\nHodgson pushed through the crowd around the bar. Running was impossible. People stood chatting in his path. He shouldered past them, half-running, half pushing — A path cleared miraculously.\n\nSomebody — a girl — came out of the crowd and began clawing his face with pointed nails. Judy!\n\n&quot;Make … love … to … the … dancer!&quot; she screamed. Her striking nails emphasized each word. &quot;Play me for a sucker, will you!&quot;\n\nHands tore her off. She sobbed: &quot;And to think I believed him, the dirty two-timing — &quot;\n\nHodgson wiped his bleeding face. &quot;That was bad, Judy. That cinched it. You&#39;re done now.&quot;\n\nShe said through angry tears: &quot;Done? What do you mean — -done!&quot; She shook off restraining hands. &quot;Oh, I won&#39;t bother him again! Let me out of here. My makeup&#39;s ruined!&quot;\n\nShe started down toward the kitchen. The rough-looking man came up the aisle. Hodgson plunged after her.\n\nThe rough-looking man was quicker. The knife in his hand was a bare gleaming flash and he was running out the kitchen door.\n\nThe singer, on her feet, screamed. Sam, the proprietor, ran to her. A gun crashed. The room was a din.\n\nHodgson reached the red-headed woman just as she pumped a second slug into her staggering husband — a shot meant for the singer beside him. Hodgson knocked the pistol down. It crashed, sent a bullet into the waxed maple floor. He twisted it from the woman&#39;s ringed hand, tore for the kitchen.\n\nThe door was still swinging. He plunged through it, ran down a sawdust floor through the cellar and out to the alley. It was empty. He raced down it to the street.\n\nFar up, under an arc light, a man broke into a run. Hodgson pounded after him.\n\nThe man turned. Hodgson flung himself into a doorway as a red spurt lanced the dark, and the crash of a pistol echoed in the street.\n\nPlate glass crashed in the street. Hodgson lined his pistol, steadying it against the brick edge of the wall. He shot carefully.\n\nThe man up the sidewalk jerked, staggered, went to his knees. He was up again, stumbling away in a limping run. Hodgson yelled: &quot;I&#39;ll drop you this time. Throw away the pistol!&quot;\n\nThe man turned, tried to lift the gun, swayed and collapsed on the sidewalk. Hodgson, gun lifted Warily, went up to him. He took the pistol out of the prone man&#39;s limp fingers, tore open his coat.\n\nThe wound was high in the leg. Hodgson made a crude compress, sent a man from the growing crowd to call the police. The man on the ground stirred, licked his lips, opened his eyes.\n\n&quot;Who hired you?&quot; Hodgson pressed.\n\nThe man said nothing. Muscles twitched in his bristled jaw.\n\n&quot;You dope! You killed the wrong girl!&quot; Hodgson said.\n\nThe man&#39;s lids lifted a little.\n\n&quot;Entertainer,&quot; he mumbled.\n\n&quot;Entertainer, sure. But not the dancer — the little sing-song gal, right?&quot;\n\nThe man&#39;s eyes were wide open now.\n\n&quot;Who did I kill?&quot;\n\n&quot;You were working for her. How much&#39;d Mae pay you for knocking off the girl her husband was trying to fool around with?\n\n&quot;Oh! Going to clam up, hunh? Well, bo, we don&#39;t fool around with girl-stabbers.&quot; Hodgson rolled the man over roughly, went through his pockets.\n\n&quot;Hah. Cash on the line, hanh?&quot; He held the roll of fresh bills to his nose. &quot;Right out of her handbag. That&#39;s Mae&#39;s perfume. She bathes in it.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re just guessin&#39;.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure. I was guessing. But now I&#39;m sure. You had to be working for one of them. Mac or Sam. If you&#39;d killed the right gal, if you&#39;d meant to kill the dancer, I wouldn&#39;t have got a rise out of you. When you acted surprised and didn&#39;t know there were two girls, I knew I was right. How&#39;s the leg, can you stand it?&quot;\n\nA white police car pulled into the curb. Hodgson gave them details.\n\n&quot;And if one of you&#39;ll come back into the club with me,&quot; he finished, &quot;I think we can clean the whole thing up.&quot;\n\nThe taller cop said: &quot;I&#39;ll go.&quot;\n\n&#39;Hodgson led him down the alley, through the kitchen past gaping help into the club, where two policemen were having all they could do to hold the hysterical Mae Klaub.\n\nHodgson went over to the cushioned wall-seat where a doctor was working over Sam Klaub.\n\n&quot;Well, Sam, how&#39;s about coming clean. The racket&#39;s washed up. I shot Joe and Willie upstairs when they tried to stick me up for the Wheelock jewelry. And your little stoolie that fingered me to them — the little tap dancer, Judy? — -just got it from a cash-and-carry killer your wife put to work.&quot;\n\nSam Klaub, lips compressed in pain, said: &quot;You&#39;re crazy, fella, I don&#39;t know nothing about no Wheelock jewels. Why, even if Mae&#39;d do anything so c-crazy as to hire a killer, why should she want Judy killed. It was Toni, the singer, she was jealous of.&quot;\n\n&quot;Right. The guy that stabbed her made a mistake. He meant to kill Toni. Mae just told him &#39;the entertainer&#39;. She forgot about the dancer. But don&#39;t worry. Everybody in town knows Joe and Willie were your handy men. And I know it was Judy that tipped &#39;em.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah, Sam. Judy got curious about a note I stuck in my pocket. She got me upstairs and pretended to go for me to get a chance to get her hands on the note. When she was taking it out of my pocket, she felt the jewel-case. I didn&#39;t know she&#39;d been in my pockets till she accused me downstairs of something.\n\nShe&#39;d&#39;ve had to see the note to know about it.&quot;\n\nThe girl, Toni, came up with a policeman.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going down to the station to make a charge,&quot; she told Hodgson. &quot;How much do I owe you?&quot;\n\n&quot;Nothing. You haven&#39;t told me yet what you hired me for. I&#39;d say it was because you were afraid Mae&#39;d have you killed out of jealously, or that Sam would because you&#39;d stumbled on his racket, right?&quot;\n\n&quot;How&#39;d you know that?&quot;\n\n&quot;Things here and there. Can I call you a cab?&quot;\n\nOn the way to the station, Hodgson said: &quot;Your testimony against Sam should put him away where he won&#39;t bother you. Of course you can go right on being a sing-song gal now, but I can think of better careers for you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Such as — &quot;\n\nHer long eyes were shadows in the dark. Hodgson put his arm out, drew her to him.\n\n&quot;This for instance.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

The heat from a brazen sky beat on the head of the man concealed in a clump of summer-dried bushes. The heavy woolen garb of the State prison clung to his bulky shoulders, which seemed to steam under the fierce sun.\n\nEight hours before, he had crawled into the shelter of the brush, and he had at least eight hours to wait. He was afraid to sleep, had sleep been possible in the overpowering heat. He knew that the chase was on.\n\nThere was reason enough to pursue Convict 1836, now free, aside from the fact that in a house without the prison walls a widow mourned a dead guard.\n\nThe escape had been planned carefully, and so far each detail had worked out perfectly. Except the dead guard. That had been one of the contingencies considered probable but hoped improbable. However, what was, was, and the man dismissed the thought. He was to be hanged anyway.\n\nThe road was empty of traffic. It was a short cut through a mountain pass from the main highway. Rarely used, it was chosen by the man&#39;s friends. That morning at dawn he had drawn back, eyes gleaming hatred and the defiance of a wolf at bay, as he watched a car of guards drive madly down the road in the direction of Bayfield. The convict had lived there, so it was the first place of search. The man almost laughed at the simplicity of their reasoning.\n\nFor hours he lay still in his thin cover of brush, fearing to seek the cooler shadows of the scrubby willows he could see in the hollow just below him. The guards might return. He tried to review the details of his further flight. The car would come for him at eight that night; they would detour around Bayfield to Edgewood. He wondered who would drive the car—they hadn&#39;t told him.\n\nBut it was too hot to think. He had to find shade. The thin mesquite offered no protection from the sun now high overhead. And those willows looked so cool. He decided to try for them.\n\nCautiously he began to work his way down through the scrub growth. He was afraid to leave the bushes and to keep behind them he couldn&#39;t rise to his feet. Once he slipped and rolled down a little gully. A sharp flint at the bottom gashed his head.\n\nThe blood from the cut mingled with the streaked grime on his face. With oaths he removed the spines of a prickly pear from an incautious hand. The trip of the night before was as nothing to the slow crawl through the all-too-thin fringe of brush.\n\nFinally he slipped into the clumps of willows. Luxuriously, he buried his face in the rank grass—growth of the recent spring rains. He stretched himself at length and reached for his cigarettes. Then he remembered he couldn&#39;t risk a smoke.\n\nBut it was almost cool here anyway. He sat up and looked around. A depression hid him from the road if he kept his head down. The leaves hid him from overhead observation. He lifted his head above the ridge and inspected the growth on the other side of the road.\n\nThen he saw it. It was the reflection of the sunlight on the tail lamp of an automobile, drawn up in the bushes. Now he could make out the shape of the car behind the curtain of leaves. How had it come there? It hadn&#39;t arrived since he had.\n\nWhy should anyone leave a car there?\n\nWhen was the owner coming back? Suppose he arrived when Slim Bates came for him. Then this other car might take up the pursuit, and he would be taken back. Everyone knew he was out now, and they knew about the guard too.\n\nHe cursed. Why was anyone using this road? It wasn&#39;t a highway. There weren&#39;t even any ranches on it. Probably it was only a joyrider who had smashed up his car, and it would stay there for a day or two.\n\nBut that explanation didn&#39;t satisfy. The man could see that other car pursuing him. He knew his friends would send a racing car, and they could outrun that thing in the bushes. But the police might see the race. And then where would he be? Even now there might be someone waiting behind that screen of leaves.\n\nThe car preyed on his mind. The convict tried to turn his back on it— to forget it. But always he returned to gaze on it and vision the pursuit through the night. He had to do something.\n\nLike a sprinter he drew himself up on his finger-tips. Like a streak of dirty gray he hurled himself across the road to fall panting beside the car. With a twist he rolled into the brush. Fearing almost to breathe, he lay still. But there was no stir in the car. The whir of a winging grasshopper was the only sound other than his own labored breathing.\n\nWith infinite caution the man edged his way up to the front of the car. Carefully he raised himself to his knees. Now that he was there what was he going to do? He was not familiar with the mechanism of automobiles, but he knew the engine was the source of its trouble as well as its power. He had seen Slim Bates working on a flivver once, and he had lifted the hood.\n\nSlowly he released the catches of the hood of this car that stood between him and liberty. Gently he raised it until the engine was revealed. Then he looked with bewilderment at the unfathomed mysteries before him. Baffled, he couldn&#39;t decide what to do. Wires led everywhere, and the thing seemed enclosed in an impassable casing of iron.\n\nBut the wires were open. With teeth showing in rage, he caught them where they led from the fuse-board and tore them loose. There was the ferocity of murder in the strength that broke the set screws from the board.\n\n&quot;Now get me,&quot; he snarled as he lowered the hood into place.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Long, Dangerous Ride\n\nRobert Emmet Long was in a hurry. He didn&#39;t like driving at night, particularly through the Bayfield cutoff. About half a mile from the main highway his lights blinked twice, then went out. There was a screech of protesting brakes as he brought the car to a stop.\n\n&quot;Wait till I get that garage man,&quot; Long groaned as he climbed out. The trouble wasn&#39;t much. Just a loose connection and in a few minutes he had found it. The lights blinked several times, then settled into a steady glow.\n\n&quot;Thank God, you got here, bo&#39;. Where&#39;s Slim Bates?&quot;\n\nLong&#39;s nerves were good, but he almost sent the car crashing into a gully at the roadside as the question came to him from the rear seat.\n\nWho was it? How had he got there? What did Slim Bates have to do with it? Everyone knew of Bates, the fixer and friend of crooks in Bay field. Who would be waiting silently in the cutoff for a car sent by Slim Bates? There must be some sinister reason.\n\nAnd the back of Long&#39;s neck crawled as he remembered the afternoon paper. It had told of the escape of a convict awaiting action on a hopeless plea for a reprieve for murder. He had killed a guard. Could he be the man behind him? It couldn&#39;t be anyone else, and Long thanked the gods of chance for the darkness that hid him. He didn&#39;t dare turn. He could feel the double murderer behind him with a gun at his back, awaiting some move. But he had to do something.\n\n&quot;Just a minute, this is a bad stretch of road here,&quot; Long replied, trying to collect his thoughts.\n\nHis way out lay through Slim. He had to take a chance.\n\n&quot;Slim is waiting for you. He was afraid to try it himself,&quot; Long tried desperately to be matter of fact. Would he get away with it?\n\nThe convict peered at the man who was now driving the car madly through the night. He didn&#39;t look like a friend of Slim&#39;s. And this sedan, richly upholstered, wasn&#39;t the kind of car he had expected.\n\n&quot;Where&#39;d he get you? I never saw you before.&quot;\n\nWhere did Slim get him? Long sought for an answer. He had never seen Slim Bates. He knew him only by reputation.\n\n&quot;No, you haven&#39;t seen me before. Slim got me so the officers wouldn&#39;t suspect anything. I owe him a big favor for getting me out of trouble once.&quot;\n\nIt sounded reasonable enough, but the man on the back seat wasn&#39;t sure. Slim ought to have come himself. However, this man had given him the signal with the lights—two flashes.\n\n&quot;Well, if Slim sent you I guess it&#39;s all right. It had better be. Where&#39;s Slim goin&#39; to meet me? Edgewood?&quot;\n\nLong almost sighed his relief. At last he had something to go ahead on. Edgewood was the meeting place then. If he could get him to Edgewood he might find a wav out.\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where&#39;s my clothes?&quot;\n\nAgain Long took a chance.\n\n&quot;At the Edgewood Hotel.&quot;\n\n&quot;How in hell am I goin&#39; to get in any hotel in this stuff?&quot; and the convict tore savagely at his prison jacket.\n\nAgain Long felt that crawling sensation at the back of his neck. There was menace in his tone. How could he get to the officers before the hotel was reached? But he thanked the dealer who had sold him the cap and long dust coat under the back seat.\n\n&quot;I was afraid to bring too much. You&#39;ll find a long coat and a cap under that seat you&#39;re sitting on. Roll up your trousers and put them on. Just as soon as you get to my room, I&#39;ll get your clothes.&quot;\n\nGrumblingly, the convict dug the coat and cap from under the back seat as the car lurched on through the night. The guy might be an outsider, but he sure could drive, and Slim had sent him. The man settled down comfortably and thought of that car back in the bushes— the car that wouldn&#39;t be able to pursue him. He could smoke now, and he did.\n\nLong was driving faster than he had ever driven before, but the speed was slow compared to his racing brain. What was he to do? The convict was armed. He had shot down a guard. Perhaps he didn&#39;t know the road to Edgewood, and Long might turn off the Bayfield when he reached the highway. How could he find out?\n\nThen, too, there was the real car Slim Bates was sending after him. Perhaps that was roaring down the road behind him even now. Apparently it had been due just when he arrived.\n\nHe stepped on the accelerator as the car started to climb the last grade where the cutoff joined the main highway. The lights of Edgewood would be in sight then, and he would have to decide quickly whether to try the run for Bayfield. The car reached the top of the grade and shot down the road at a speed that drove the convict against the back of the car.\n\n&quot;Slow down, bo&#39;, slow down,&quot; came the harsh command from the back seat. &quot;Do you want one of these Bayfield speed cops stopping us? They used to hang around here.&quot;\n\nLong&#39;s question was answered. He had to keep on to Edgewood.\n\nThe man on the rear seat stirred uneasily. Why was Slim getting so careful? And if he couldn&#39;t come himself, why did he have to pick an outsider? This one could drive all right, but he didn&#39;t like it. He&#39;d tell Slim so when he met him.\n\n&quot;Where&#39;d you say Slim was going to meet me?&quot; he asked again.\n\n&quot;At the Edgewood Hotel; I will have to go for him.&quot; Long had to stick by his story.\n\nThe convict didn&#39;t like the idea of the hotel. Why didn&#39;t Slim pick out one of the regular hangouts?\n\n&quot;How you goin&#39; to get me in that hotel? I can&#39;t go through the front. Slim must be crazy sending me to a hotel where the bulls could find me without lookin&#39;.&quot;\n\nWhy had Slim picked out a hotel? It didn&#39;t seem natural. Again Long took a chance.\n\n&quot;A hotel is just the place they wouldn&#39;t look for you. It&#39;s too public. I&#39;ll take you up the back way.&quot;\n\n&quot;And have everybody asking why. No you don&#39;t.&quot;\n\n&quot;No one will see you but the porter, and he knows me. I live there.&quot; If he could get the man to his room he might find a way. That menacing tone behind him had driven out any thought of attempting to hail an officer.\n\n&quot;Well, see that you keep to the dark streets. I don&#39;t like this much,&quot; and the convict&#39;s tone carried dread.\n\nThey were in the outskirts of Edgewood, and the man on the back seat pulled the cap down over his eyes and huddled into a comer. His eyes never left Long&#39;s hands as they gripped the steering wheel. He wasn&#39;t quite sure of this driver, even though he talked so smoothly.\n\nAnd Long gave up hope of being stopped by a policeman. That first caution about driving had been sufficient. He was going carefully now. Through side streets and up alleys he drove and he twisted and turned by devious ways. Long could not shake off the thought of Slim Bates following close behind. Finally he brought the car to a stop.\n\nIn an instant the convict was leaning over him, and Long&#39;s vision of the revolver at his back was a reality.\n\n&quot;What are you doin&#39;?&quot; he demanded. A nameless iron door showed under the glare of a light. Iron doors meant barred windows to the man who had done murder to escape them. And there was murder in his voice now.\n\n&quot;This is the back door of the Edgewood Hotel,&quot; and Long struggled to keep his voice steady. &quot;Wait until I get the porter.&quot;\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t you leave me. Just knock until he comes.&quot;\n\nSo, Long knocked and prayed that no questions would be asked by whoever opened it. Eventually the knock was answered, and a negro stuck his head out. The convict settled back in his seat, but Long could still feel in memory the ominous thrust of the revolver muzzle.\n\n&quot;Whacha want?&quot; the porter demanded. &quot;Howdy, Mista Long, I didn&#39;t reekugnize you. Is they anythin&#39; the mattah?&quot;\n\n&quot;Nothing, Julius. Just a friend of mine in an accident, and I want to take him upstairs the back way to my room.&quot;\n\n&quot;Come right on in. It&#39;s suttinly too bad. Is you hurt much?&quot; and Julius looked with amazement at the dust- covered, blood-streaked man who accompanied Long. But the negro went without an answer as he took them up in the freight elevator.\n\nThe corridors were empty as Long led the way to his room.\n\n&quot;Slim said not to telephone, but to come for him,&quot; Long said when they were inside. &quot;You wash up, and I&#39;ll go get him.&quot;\n\n&quot;Looka here. I don&#39;t like this. Slim ain&#39;t actin&#39; right.&quot;\n\n&quot;He figured it out as the best way. I&#39;m risking my neck helping you now. You will have to fight it out with Slim. I&#39;d take you out, but Slim said he would bring your clothes when I got you here. You can&#39;t wear mine.&quot; The convict didn&#39;t reply as he felt the constriction of the dust coat across his burly shoulders.\n\n&quot;Make yourself comfortable. I&#39;ll bring Slim back with me,&quot; Long started for the door.\n\n&quot;Well, see&#39;t you make it snappy,&quot; and the convict threw himself onto the bed.\n\nHe stretched himself luxuriously. This was something like. He was almost free now. Slim would have the rest of it all arranged. He burrowed his way down into the softness of the bed. How tired he was. That guy who brought him here wasn&#39;t so bad, after all. He would tell him so when he came back. He thought at first he&#39;d made a mistake. But old Slim knew what he was doing, and now Slim was coming. Nothing further to worry about.\n\nA knock on the door roused him from a doze. Sleepily he rose to his feet. Slim was here, and soon he could go to bed for a week.\n\nHe crossed the room hastily and opened the door.\n\nWith mouth agape he stared into a revolver in the hands of a detective.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nSlim Bates Cursed\n\nBack in the Bayfield cutoff Slim Bates raised the hood of his car, drawn into the bushes at the side of the road, and cursed. Every connection had been torn loose from the fuse-board.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

It had been a contest of skill against pluck, and success had never been sure until the very last moment.\n\nBy a thousand artful turns and twists of his adversary, had the great detective been forced to do his level best. But he had conquered, and the victim of his prowess lay on the grass, at his feet.\n\nI had come up in time to witness the conclusion of the struggle. The scene was a &quot;deep hole&quot; in the prettiest trout stream in Monroe County, Pennsylvania. The time was five o&#39;clock of a May morning.\n\nNick held up the sparkling prey for my admiration. Then suddenly he dropped the brook trout, and faced about, looking across the pool.\n\nI followed the direction of his glance, but saw nothing worthy of special attention, nor could I hear any sound but those that told of nature waking in the forest.\n\n&quot;That fellow is in a great hurry,&quot; said Nick.\n\n&quot;What fellow?&quot; I asked.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s a question I can&#39;t answer,&quot; rejoined Nick, with a smile. &quot;But I can make out that he&#39;s a tall man, familiar with the woods, has been running a long way, and will hit the stream about opposite us if he keeps on as he&#39;s going.&quot;\n\nHalf a minute later I was able to distinguish the faint sound of crackling twigs; but it seemed incredible that even Nick&#39;s ear could catch the separate footfalls, showing the length of the stride, and the labored breathing of the runner. That he was a woodsman was evident to me as to Nick, from the lightness of his tread among the underbrush and from the rapidity of his advance.\n\nPresently he appeared upon the other side of the pool. He was a tall young man, seemingly a native of those parts, but certainly not a farmer. He had a rather handsome and remarkably intelligent countenance; and, despite his brown skin and rough attire, there was a hint of the scholar about him.\n\nIt was evident from his expression, as he looked across at us, that he had come to seek us, but he seemed in no hurry to announce his errand. I noted that he paid little attention to me, but stared at Nick point-blank.\n\n&quot;Good morning, Mr. Carter,&quot; he said, at last.\n\nI was considerably surprised by this recognition, though my friend was known as Mr. Carter to Farmer Marvin, at whose house we had spent the previous night, and to a few others thereabouts.\n\n&quot;I sized you up from descriptions that I got from one or two people,&quot; continued the young man. &quot;There&#39;s only one Carter from New York who can shoulder Marvin&#39;s flatboat as if she was a birch canoe, and walk off with her.&quot;\n\nThe feat to which he alluded had been performed on the afternoon before, when we had fished in Waverly Pond. I was not aware that anybody but myself had seen it.\n\n&quot;Your facts are scanty,&quot; rejoined Nick pleasantly; &quot;but your conclusion is accurate. What can I do for you?&quot;\n\n&quot;The boot&#39;s on the other leg,&quot; retorted the young man. &quot;I&#39;m going to do something for you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very kind of you, I&#39;m sure,&quot; said Nick. &quot;What is it?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going to put you on to one of the prettiest murder mysteries that ever you tackled,&quot; said the young man, with enthusiasm. &quot;It happened last night, but it wasn&#39;t discovered till this morning. I was right there at the time, and I knew what to do.\n\n&quot;I said to all of &#39;em, including Deputy Sheriff Wilson, who got there almost as soon as I did: &#39;Don&#39;t disturb anything. Save it for Nick Carter.&#39; And I made &#39;em do it, too.&quot;\n\n&quot;What was it that they saved?&quot; asked Nick.\n\n&quot;There was his coat, all covered with blood, and the horse and wagon in the yard, and the broken board over the hiding place where he kept his money, and – &quot;\n\n&quot;Where who kept his money?&quot; demanded Nick.\n\nThe young man paused, shamefaced, like a boy who had done something very foolish when he has tried to be especially smart. He covered his embarrassment with a laugh.\n\n&quot;Guess I&#39;m a bit rattled,&quot; he said. &quot;Besides, I&#39;ve had a hard run, and my breaths not as yet got back into my body. I&#39;ll be all right in a jiffy. You come across the brook — there&#39;s a fallen tree for a bridge just below here — and by the time you get over I&#39;ll be ready to talk.&quot;\n\nNick said nothing; but he started at once for the broken tree. I followed him, and we crossed the brook, young man was waiting for us.\n\nI had already &#39;sized him up.&#39; He was, or fancied himself to be, an amateur detective, with great talent for criminal investigation. He had probably studied the subject as it is presented in fiction. This crime which he had so imperfectly disclosed to us was doubtless his first opportunity for the display of his abilities, and he intended to prove his merit under the eyes of the great master of detection.\n\nIt struck me that he was acting wisely. A man of less sense would have tried to keep Nick Carter out of the case as long as possible, in order to secure for himself the honor of detecting the criminal.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nNow For This Crime\n\nThe young man had fully recovered his self-command when we joined him after crossing the brook.\n\n&quot;My name is Walter Fairman,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ve been teaching the school at Waverly Falls. Everybody round here knows me.\n\n&quot;Now for this crime. I was coming along the highroad, toward Marvin&#39;s, about three-quarters of an hour ago, intending to fish this stream. Just as I got opposite Sam Bennett&#39;s house —  which is about a third of a mile the other side of Marvin&#39;s — I heard a woman scream.\n\n&quot;She seemed to be in Bennett&#39;s stable, which is built alongside his barn. The barn&#39;s back of the house, and the stable stands out at right angles with both, so that when you walk into the yard, the stable faces you and the house is on the left.\n\n&quot;As I came up, I had noticed Bennett&#39;s horse and wagon in the yard. The horse was facing the stable doors, which were closed. It looked as if Bennett had just driven in; and I wondered where he had been so early in the morning.\n\n&quot;When I heard the scream, I ran into the yard. Just as I did so, Mrs. Bennett threw open the big doors of the stable.\n\n&quot;She seemed to be a good deal stirred up about something. Says I: &#39;What&#39;s the matter, Mrs. Bennett?&#39;\n\n&quot;She looked at me sort o&#39; queer, as if she didn&#39;t know what to say. Finally she told me that she&#39;d been robbed.\n\n&quot;Of course, I asked her all about it. She took me into the stable, and showed me a hole in the floor in a corner. Two or three planks had been pried up, and there were fresh splinters of wood, showing that it had been done very recently. Also, the amount of breaking and splintering proved that it had been done in a hurry. An ax lay on the floor, near by.\n\n&quot;Under one of the planks — a short piece, evidently cut to fit across two beams that were only about two feet apart — was a sort of box, made strongly, and fastened to the beams, on each side.\n\n&quot;&#39;That&#39;s where Sam kept his money,&#39; said Mrs. Bennett; &#39;and it&#39;s gone.&#39; &quot;\n\n&quot;Certainly, there was no money in the box, then. I asked her if he threw it in there loose, and she said no; he had a small, sheet-iron box to hold it, that had been taken away.\n\n&quot;&#39;Where&#39;s Mr. Bennett?&#39; I asked.\n\n&quot;&#39;He&#39;s gone away,&#39; she said. &#39;I don&#39;t expect him back to-day.&#39;\n\n&quot;I thought that her manner was queer, but it was a good deal stranger when she began to urge me not to say anything about what I had seen.\n\n&quot;&#39;Sam wouldn&#39;t like it,&#39; she said. &#39;Besides, we can catch the thief easier if we keep quiet.&#39;\n\n&quot;Just then, who should walk in but John Wilson, the deputy sheriff. He happened to be passing by — going fishing, just as I was — and he saw the horse and wagon in the yard. It seems that the horse had started while I was in the stable, and had come near turning the wagon over. Wilson had run in to keep him from doing it. Then he had naturally looked into the stable, to see who was there.\n\n&quot;He heard what Mrs. Bennett said about catching a thief, and that being in his line, he asked what had been stolen.\n\n&quot;Mrs. Bennett started to lie to him, but she thought better of it, and told him the truth.\n\n&quot;While she was doing it, I was taking a look around, and what do you think I found? Why, I found Sam Bennett&#39;s coat, all covered with blood, lying on the stable floor. I didn&#39;t pick it up. I just stooped down and examined it, to make sure that the stains were really blood. At the same time I saw other red marks on the floor, near the coat.\n\n&quot;Then I managed to get Wilson aside for a moment, and I told him that there was something worse than robbery in the case. He took a look at the coat, and motioned to me to say nothing to Mrs. Bennett.\n\n&quot;&#39;You&#39;ll get cold here,&#39; says he to her, intending to get her out of the way, so that we could talk. &#39;Run into the house, and put a shawl on.&#39;\n\n&quot;She was dressed very thinly, and it was rather chilly. I had noticed that she was shivering.\n\n&quot;When Wilson told her to go in and get a shawl, she went right away. Then he asked me what I knew about the matter, and I told him.\n\n&quot;&#39;Bennett&#39;s been murdered,&#39; said he. &#39;Probably he came out here early, to hitch up the horse, and went to his money box. Some tramp, that had been sleeping in the barn, saw him, and killed him for the money. We&#39;ll find his body hidden in the barn.&#39;\n\n&quot;&#39;That theory won&#39;t work,&#39; said I to him. &#39;These bloodstains are several hours old. Besides that, why did Bennett hitch up his horse with his head toward the stable doors? No, sir; this crime was committed last evening. Bennett had just got back from somewhere.\n\n&quot;All this time I was doing some thinking. Why had Mrs. Bennett told me her husband had gone off to stay a day or two, when she knew that the horse and wagon were in the yard? What had she been doing in the stable? How did she account for the horse being there, without any driver? It wasn&#39;t reasonable to suppose that she had been out anywhere in the wagon, dressed as she was.&quot;\n\n&quot;In short,&quot; said Nick, &quot;you believed Mrs. Bennett guilty of the crime.&quot;\n\n&quot;No, sir,&quot; replied Fairman, with something like a chuckle. &quot;I&#39;d been keeping my eyes open, and I&#39;d seen one or two things. In the first place, the thief had ripped up several planks before he&#39;d found the right one. Mrs. Bennett knew where it was.\n\n&quot;In the second place, she never could have ripped up those planks; it required a man&#39;s strength. Now, here&#39;s the problem, and I think it&#39;s worthy of your genius, Mr. Carter:\n\n&quot;Mrs. Bennett lied to me. She tried to keep the affair a secret. Her manner was calculated to excite suspicion in anybody. Her story about her husband&#39;s absence shows that she knew something had happened to him.\n\n&quot;Yet she didn&#39;t do the deed; she screamed when she found that it had been done. How do you reconcile these facts?&quot;\n\n&quot;Let me have a few more facts first,&quot; said Nick. &quot;What happened after she left you and Wilson?&quot;\n\n&quot;Several other men came by, and Wilson called them in. They were most of them strangers, who had come up here to fish. Wilson explained the case to them, and a search of the stable was begun. I didn&#39;t wait for it. I didn&#39;t have the time to waste.&quot;\n\nHe looked knowingly at Nick as he said these words. I could not fathom his meaning, but Nick seemed to understand.\n\n&quot;I told Wilson about your being here,&quot; Fairman continued. &quot;I made him promise not to disturb things; to hunt for the body, but not to move it in case he found it, till you arrived. Of course he won&#39;t find it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why not?&quot; I asked.\n\n&quot;Because it isn&#39;t there,&quot; he replied, with a wink at Nick.\n\nI was nettled to be treated in this way by a yokel. Yet I could not deny that he was a shrewd fellow.\n\n&quot;I see your point,&quot; said Nick. &quot;You think that the murder was committed somewhere else, and that the bloody coat was put there just as a blind.&quot;\n\n&quot;Precisely!&quot; cried Fairman. &quot;Why should the murderer take pains to hide the body, and leave the coat in plain sight?&quot;\n\n&quot;There&#39;s something in that,&quot; said the detective. &quot;Did you have any further conversation with Mrs. Bennett?&quot; &quot;No; she hadn&#39;t got back from the house when I left. I hurried away because I hoped to catch you before you left Marvin&#39;s.&quot;\n\nThat was the substance of Fairman&#39;s story as it was told to us as we hurried toward the Bennett house.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Bennett House\n\nHalf a dozen men were talking excitedly in the road before the house as we came up. Wilson was one of them. Others could be seen in the yard before the stable door.\n\n&quot;Well, Wilson, did you find the body?&quot; asked Fairman, as we came up.\n\n&quot;No; is that Mr. Carter?&quot;\n\nAll eyes were turned upon the great detective.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s the man,&quot; said Fairman, with the air of one who is exhibiting a trophy.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m glad to see you, sir,&quot; said Wilson, walking up to Nick. &quot;This is a very strange affair.&quot;\n\n&quot;From what this gentleman has told me, I should judge that it is,&quot; replied the detective.\n\n&quot;Where is Mrs. Bennett?&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s the strangest part of it!&quot; exclaimed Wilson. &quot;She has disappeared !&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re a smart man, I don&#39;t think,&quot; said Fairman. &quot;Why did you let her get away?&quot;\n\n&quot;I never thought of her going,&quot; protested Wilson.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s natural enough,&quot; sneered Fairman. &quot;Circumstances are against her.&quot;\n\n&quot;Now, look here,&quot; rejoined Wilson warmly; &quot;I don&#39;t set up to be a detective, but I hope I&#39;ve got common sense. Here&#39;s a woman who has lived in this community all her life, and is known to be a good Christian and a loving wife. Don&#39;t you try to tell me that she killed her husband. I know her too well to believe you. She had nothing to do with it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then why has she run away?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t believe she has run away.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then what&#39;s become of her?&quot; Wilson threw up his hands with a gesture of utter bewilderment.\n\n&quot;Have you searched the house and barn?&quot; asked Nick.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ve searched everywhere,&quot; responded Wilson, with something like a groan. &quot;We can&#39;t find a trace of her or of Sam Bennett&#39;s body.&quot;\n\n&quot;If you&#39;ll allow me,&quot; said Nick, &quot;I&#39;ll take a look around, the premises. Meanwhile permit me to suggest, if there&#39;s any place where Mrs. Bennett would be likely to go, that you send there.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s what I was about to do,&quot; Wilson replied. &quot;These five men are going around to all the houses near here.&quot;\n\n&quot;Has she any relatives in the neighborhood?&quot;\n\n&quot;No; she has a brother living about three miles down the road.&quot;\n\n&quot;Who occupied this house besides Mr. and Mrs. Bennett?&quot;\n\n&quot;Nobody is here now. They have lived alone since their daughter Jennie was married, about three months ago.&quot;\n\nNick, Fairman, and I walked toward the stable. Wilson and the other men went upon their several errands.\n\nWe were assured by a man named Hamlin, who was on guard in the stable, that nothing had been disturbed. Hamlin was a sort of unofficial deputy of Wilson&#39;s.\n\nNick made a rapid general survey of the place, glanced into the barn, which was reached by a door from the stable, and then turned his attention to the bloodstains.\n\nThere were some small, irregular splashes on the floor, and then a line of drops leading direct to the spot where the coat lay.\n\nIt was a much-worn garment, spread flat upon the floor, with the lining upward. The stains were all on the lining, and close together. They represented a considerable quantity of blood.\n\nAs Nick rose from beside the coat, I saw a peculiar smile upon his face.\n\n&quot;Here&#39;s something that will interest you,&quot; he said to Fairman.\n\nBetween his thumb and finger he held half a dozen short, gray hairs.\n\n&quot;That fits my theory exactly!&quot; cried Fairman. &quot;Bennett&#39;s head has rested on that coat. His hair was gray, and he wore it about that length. He must have been killed by a blow on the head, and then this coat was wrapped around the fatal wound to prevent the blood from staining something else.\n\n&quot;My belief is that the body was carried in that wagon from the place where the crime was committed to the place where the murderer has concealed the corpse. Then, probably, the horse was turned loose, and wandered here.&quot;\n\n&quot;There is evidence in support of that last view,&quot; said Nick. &quot;I suppose your sharp eyes noted the wagon tracks in the street and in the yard.&quot;\n\n&quot;You bet; I noticed them right away,&quot; replied Fairman, with an emphatic nod. &quot;The tracks show that the wagon must have grazed one of the gateposts, and that the horse had strayed about the yard before coming to a halt. I can swear that there was nobody in the wagon when it came into this yard.&quot;\n\n&quot;As to the crime having been committed elsewhere,&quot; said Nick, &quot;what do you say to this?&quot;\n\nHe pointed to a broken bottle on the floor. It had been a large and heavy bottle. The bottom of it, and a few fragments, lay near those bloodstains which were farthest from the coat. The neck of the bottle was some distance away, in a corner.\n\nNick picked up the bottom of the bottle and showed a faint stain of blood upon a ragged edge of the glass. Fairman was staggered.\n\n&quot;It looks as if he had been knocked down with that bottle,&quot; he admitted. &quot;Perhaps I was wrong. In that case, the body was certainly carried away in the wagon.&quot;\n\n&quot;You noticed that a piece had been torn out of the lining of the coat?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes; but that might have been done long ago.&quot;\n\n&quot;I do not think so,&quot; said Nick; and he proceeded to tear out another piece.\n\nThe first had been a strip about two inches wide and a foot long. Nick put into his pocket that which he had torn off.\n\n&quot;The murderer probably used that to wipe his hands on,&quot; commented Fairman.\n\nNick made no reply. He was scanning the stable floor closely. At last he walked toward a small and rough door which opened from the rear of the stable.\n\n&quot;Here are more bloodstains,&quot; he said. We approached just as Nick opened the door. There were stains upon the threshold, though they were very faint, scarcely perceptible, in fact. The principal one was nearly round, and somewhat smaller than a watch.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s see what we can find in this direction,&quot; said Nick, leading the way into a little garden behind the stable.\n\n&quot;Here are a man&#39;s tracks!&quot; exclaimed Fairman. &quot;They&#39;re not Bennett&#39;s; they&#39;re too small. He had enormous feet.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;ll find several men&#39;s tracks if you look closely,&quot; remarked Nick. &quot;The searching party seems to have been out here.&quot;\n\nThere was a path leading toward a Held. The ground was very soft, and footprints could be easily traced.\n\nThere was one line of them that was plainly visible. It led along the path. I made out that he who had made those footprints had been running rapidly.\n\nConsidering the ease with which they could be seen, I was surprised to observe the extreme caution with which Nick proceeded.\n\nAfter he had gone about fifty yards, however, he went on with more confidence. We passed into the Held, which was partly overgrown with grass, and partly bare.\n\nCrossing this, we came to a fringe of trees. Here Nick made quite an extended search. He went down to the bank of a brook which flowed beyond the trees, and I followed him, but I sawno tracks there. Then we returned; and presently Nick found what he was seeking. It was a box made of tinned iron. There had been a padlock on it, but it had been wrenched away. The box was empty.\n\n&quot;You&#39;ve tracked the thief,&quot; said Fairman, in envious admiration. &quot;That&#39;s Bennett&#39;s cash box, beyond a doubt.&quot;\n\nNick said nothing. He began to walk rapidly back toward the stable.\n\nWhen he reached the little door he paused for a moment, and, naturally, Fairman and I came to a halt. The schoolmaster turned about, and set his back against the stable. Then he sprang away, uttering a loud cry, and pointing to the field.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nMrs. Bennett Returns\n\nI looked, and saw a woman running. Just as my eye lighted upon her, she dodged behind some bushes on the edge of the garden.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s Mrs. Bennett!&quot; cried Fairman. &quot;She&#39;s coming back.&quot;\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t let her know that you saw her,&quot; said Nick, and he drew us into the stable.\n\nWe watched cautiously from a window. The woman approached the house, shielding herself from observation as well as she could. No one saw her but us. She passed on the other side of the barn. We walked hurriedly through the stable, crossed the yard, and entered the kitchen of the house, just as she came in by a door on the opposite side. The room was an L, and occupied the full width of it.\n\n&quot;Good morning, Mrs. Bennett,&quot; said Nick. &quot;Where have you been?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, that&#39;s cool,&quot; she rejoined. &quot;If it&#39;s any of your business, I&#39;ve been down to the barn, looking out for the cows.&quot;\n\n&quot;You don&#39;t seem to take much interest in this robbery.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why should I? We&#39;ll never see the money again. It&#39;s gone, and there&#39;s the end of it. Some of those pesky tramps have stolen it. I should think the law might do something to protect us from those critters.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where is your husband?&quot;\n\n&quot;I dunno. He&#39;s gone off somewhere. He&#39;ll be back in a day or two.&quot;\n\n&quot;Who hitched up your horse this morning?&quot;\n\n&quot;The tramp, I reckon. He probably intended to steal him, but was frightened away. I heard the horse in the yard, and went out to take care of him.&quot;\n\n&quot;Mrs. Bennett,&quot; said Fairman, breaking in, &quot;why do you act in this way? A crime has been committed, and you seem disposed to shield the criminal. Don&#39;t you know that we have reason to believe that your husband has met with foul play?&quot;\n\n&quot;You mean he&#39;s been murdered?&quot; she cried.\n\nFairman bowed his head.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t believe it!&quot; she exclaimed; and then, falling into a chair, she buried her face in her hands, while her frame shook as with sobs.\n\nAt first I pitied her, but, on closer inspection, I decided that she was only pretending to cry.\n\nThe woman&#39;s heartlessness shocked me. That she was an accomplice in the crime was to me a matter of certainty. Her clumsy efforts to account for her husband&#39;s absence, and her absurd assumption of the manner of an innocent person ignorant of the facts would have excited my pity if the enormity of her crime had not made them abhorrent.\n\nI tried to question her, but she would not speak. Nothing could induce her to move from that chair or to take her hands from her face.\n\nNick paid no attention to the woman.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going over to the railroad station,&quot; said he to me. &quot;I want to send telegrams to the surrounding towns, giving a description of the criminal, with directions for his arrest.&quot;\n\n&quot;A description!&quot; I cried. &quot;How can you give that?&quot;\n\n&quot;I can furnish one that is infallible,&quot; said Nick, with a smile.\n\n&quot;There was something in his footprints – &quot;\n\nNick shook his head.\n\n&quot;I never saw any that were more commonplace.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then I&#39;m all at sea.&quot;\n\nFairman&#39;s face took on a strange expression, made up of surprise, disappointment, and a dozen other emotions. He followed Nick to the door.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nYou have learned about Martin Heywood\n\n&quot;You have learned about Martin Heywood,&quot; he said, in a low, anxious voice.\n\n&quot;Never heard of him,&quot; said Nick. &quot;Who is he?&quot;\n\n&quot;This woman&#39;s brother, and the principal in this crime, beyond a doubt. Don&#39;t try to deceive me. You are on his track.&quot;\n\n&quot;I may be,&quot; said Nick; &quot;but, upon my word, I didn&#39;t know it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Didn&#39;t know it!&quot;\n\n&quot;No; what makes you think he&#39;s the man?&quot;\n\n&quot;He&#39;s Bennett&#39;s only enemy. There was a lawsuit. Everybody around here knows that Bennett&#39;s testimony would have cost Heywood nine-tenths of all he&#39;s worth. He had testified once against his brother-in-law, and Heywood threatened to kill him then.\n\n&quot;The case went against Heywood, but, on appeal, a new trial was ordered. The case was to be called to-morrow.\n\n&quot;Wilson had the summons for Bennett in his pocket. He wasn&#39;t going fishing; he was coming here to serve it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Rather early in the morning,&quot; said Nick.\n\n&quot;Yes; Wilson was afraid Bennett would evade it. As a matter of fact, he was afraid for his life if he testified.&quot;\n\n&quot;And you think that Heywood killed him to suppress his testimony?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes; is there any other explanation of this woman&#39;s conduct? She knows her brother did the deed. She&#39;s trying to shield him.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s a promising theory,&quot; said Nick. &quot;Suppose you go to Heywood&#39;s house and try to work it up, while I go and send my telegrams.&quot;\n\n&quot;Telegrams? Do you think Heywood has run away?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know anything about it.&quot;\n\nFairman was puzzled, but not more than I was.\n\n&quot;You seem to be guessing,&quot; said the schoolmaster, at last. &quot;You discover evidence accidentally. I&#39;ve heard a good deal about your luck, and now I believe it.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll tell you one piece of evidence that you&#39;ve turned up. There&#39;s a way to Heywood&#39;s house along that brook where you found the box. What do you think of that?&quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s quite interesting,&quot; said Nick. &quot;I suppose Mrs. Bennett ran away to see her brother?&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very natural.&quot;\n\nNick nodded an adieu to Fairman, and walked away in the direction of the railroad station. I followed him. As we went down the road, we saw Fairman going the other way, probably toward Heywood&#39;s. There was nobody to watch Mrs. Bennett, unless the men who loitered about the stable yard could see her through the windows.\n\nNick sent his telegrams, and we spent the forenoon waiting around the station for replies.\n\nNone had come at twelve o&#39;clock. We decided to go to Farmer Marvin&#39;s for dinner, crossed the railroad tracks, and struck into the road, when suddenly Nick went down upon his knees, and closely examined the ground.\n\nI had no doubt that he had recognized a footprint, but none was visible to me. Nick was surely on the trail. He followed it back to the railroad, then up the path, beside the tracks, until at last he stopped beside some freight cars that were stalled there.\n\nAfter several efforts he opened the door of one of them. As he did so, I noticed a faint mark of blood on the wood just under the door.\n\nThe light that struck into the car shone full into the face of a frowzy tramp who sat on a sackful of merchandise, and stared stupidly at us.\n\nHis hand rested upon the head of the most miserable dog that ever I saw. The animal was a mongrel of a thousand low breeds at once. It had suffered in its wanderings even more than its master. I observed with pity that the creature was lean with hunger, and that one of its feet had been badly hurt, and was bandaged.\n\nIt offered a feeble resistance — the best of which the faithful brute was capable — when Nick sprang into the car and laid his hand on the man&#39;s shoulder.\n\n&quot;You are under arrest,&quot; was all the detective said.\n\nThe tramp swore a round oath, but he made no resistance. He took the wretched dog in his arms, and tenderly carried it out of the car. Once upon the ground, the dog ran well enough with three legs.\n\nThere was a rude hotel opposite the station. Nick put the tramp and the dog into a room there, set the landlord to guard them, and called to me to follow.\n\n&quot;We have the criminal now,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s time to look for the body of the victim.&quot;\n\n&quot;And for the money,&quot; said I. &quot;The tramp had none when you searched him.&quot;\n\n&quot;We shall find that, too,&quot; rejoined Nick.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nHeywood’s House\n\nAs we walked along, I plied him with questions about the proof against the man whom he had arrested. All I could get out of him was the somewhat irrelevant remark that he had a right to make an arrest, for Wilson had authorized him to act as a deputy.\n\nWe came at last to a very nice house, nearly two miles beyond the station. To my surprise, we found Fairman at the gate.\n\n&quot;What does Heywood say?&quot; asked Nick.\n\nSo that was Heywood&#39;s house. I had not known it before.\n\n&quot;He won&#39;t talk,&quot; replied Fairman; &quot;but his manner is conclusive. That man is guilty.&quot;\n\nHeywood appeared at this moment.\n\n&quot;This is all foolishness about Sam Bennett being murdered,&quot; he said. &quot;And, as for my having anything to do with it, that&#39;s worse yet. I&#39;ve got nothing agin&#39; Bennett.&quot;\n\n&quot;Since when have you been reconciled?&quot; demanded Nick.\n\nThe man bit his lip, but did not answer.\n\n&quot;Now, Mr. Heywood,&quot; said Nick, &quot;look right down in the dirt at your feet and you will see the track of Mr. Bennett&#39;s wagon, made last evening. He came over to see you, and, in my opinion, lie&#39;s here yet. I&#39;m going to search your house.&quot;\n\nHeywood groaned.\n\n&quot;You&#39;ve got the authority, have you?&quot;\n\nNick nodded. Of course, it was a &quot;bluff.&quot;\n\nHeywood turned toward the house.\n\n&quot;Sam!&quot; he yelled. &quot;Come out here. There&#39;s no use of staying in there any longer.&quot;\n\nPresently the elongated form of Samuel Bennett appeared at the door.\n\n&quot;Well, I swear!&quot; ejaculated Fairman.\n\n&quot;Good day, Mr. Bennett,&quot; said Nick. &quot;I was told that you were murdered, but I didn&#39;t believe it. I&#39;m not yet sure whether you&#39;ve been robbed.&quot;\n\n&quot;No, I ha&#39;n&#39;t lost nothin&#39;,&quot; growled Bennett. &quot;I took all my money out&#39;n that hidin&#39; place last evening. I&#39;d seen a tramp critter hanging &#39;round my barn, and I was afeared.&quot;\n\n&quot;He was in the barn when you hitched up your horse last night,&quot; said Nick. &quot;He watched you through a knot hole in the door between the barn and the stable. I saw the prints of his muddy boots on the floor. He had to stand on tiptoe to see through the hole, and he supported himself by partly gripping a dusty beam over the door.\n\n&quot;He saw you when you went to your bank, but he didn&#39;t know that you took your money out. After you were gone, he ripped up the floor and stole the empty box.\n\n&quot;Meanwhile his dog stepped on a piece of an old bottle, and cut his foot. Then he limped over to your coat, and lay down on it while he nursed his wound. The bloodstains led to the theory that you had been murdered. Our friend Mr. Fairman was impolite enough to say that some of the dog&#39;s hair looked very much like yours.\n\n&quot;After a study of the case, I sent some telegrams requesting the police of neighboring towns to arrest a tramp with a three-legged dog. I subsequently arrested him myself. I also recovered your box, by following the trail of three legs out of four — for I knew, of course, that the dog was so badly hurt that he would hold up one of his feet.\n\n&quot;Your wife&#39;s disappearance this morning, and her subsequent demeanor could be explained only on the theory that she had come over here to see you, and had found you all right. Therefore I came to seek you here. I suppose she persuaded you not to testify against her brother, and that you intended to hide at his house to avoid service of the summons. Am I right?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, blast you!&quot; said Bennett.\n\n&quot;And the horse?&quot; queried Nick. &quot;Did he run away?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes; confound him. I had just hitched him up this morning, intending to take him back before it was light, when he bolted. I went after him, but lost the track, and when I at last got in sight of the house, there were a lot of people around, and I didn&#39;t dare to go in.&quot;\n\nNick turned to Fairman.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m obliged to you for a pleasant and novel experience,&quot; he said. &quot;Will you join us on our fishing trip this afternoon?&quot;\n\n&quot;No!&quot; growled Fairman. &quot;I&#39;m going home, to kick myself.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Wellington-on-Sea\n  Digging Up Difficulties\n  A Treacherous Animal\n  The Money Aspect\n  Identity Established\n  Pryde Takes a Fall!\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nWellington-on-Sea\n\nThe silence of Seaview Avenue, that bungalow-strewn byway of the select resort called Wellington-on-Sea, was undisturbed by Constable Smith as he made his way along its broad pavement. P.C. Smith was keeping a lookout for George Pryde, an ex-screen comedian. Pryde was double-jointed, and he had an almost unbelievable elasticity of countenance. There had been at one time something of a public demand for postcard pictures of his funnily or hideously distorted face.\n\nMiss Alice Reesdale, who was living alone in the little bungalow called the Retreat, in Seaview Avenue, had lately been receiving a series of these pictures through the post — unsigned and unaccompanied by any message.\n\nThere is no accounting for the doings of practical jokers, but these pictures seemed to have special significance in Miss Reesdale&#39;s case.\n\nShe was Pryde&#39;s former screen partner and fiancée, and, after their quarrel, he had made repeated threats that no other man should have her. His jealousy was fierce enough to make his sanity suspect, though people had been content to dismiss his fiery temperament as the natural complement of his red hair.\n\nIt was a few minutes after midnight when the constable thought he saw a shadowy figure amidst the shrubbery surrounding the Firs, a somewhat larger bungalow than Miss Reesdale&#39;s, and situated at the end of the avenue, about a hundred yards away from the Retreat.\n\nHe went to investigate, searched the grounds, and then, seeing a light in one of the front windows, knocked and conveyed his suspicions to the occupant, Mr. Herbert Foster. Foster was a bachelor, and his appearance would have been unremarkable but for his bushy black beard.\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t be sure,&quot; said P.C. Smith. &quot;Maybe it was the shadow of a tree or something. Anyway, there doesn&#39;t seem to be anyone about. Thought I&#39;d tell you, as your still up, just to be on the safe side.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thanks, officer,&quot; said Mr. Foster. &quot;Have a drink?&quot;\n\nWhile the policeman was in the drawing-room drinking a glass of sherry, young Henry Wheeler came in.\n\nWheeler was the chauffeur-valet-butler to Mr. Foster, and it seemed to be a very pleasant sort of job.\n\nWheeler&#39;s bearded employer gave him much more liberty than do most employers, treating him more as a member of the household.\n\n&quot;Just been for a bit of a stroll along the seafront,&quot; said Wheeler, starting slightly at sight of the constable.\n\nFoster presently winked at the constable as, with easy familiarity, Wheeler helped himself to a drink from the sideboard.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s love, Officer,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that ex-actress, Miss Reesdale, has taken a bit of a fancy to the lad, but she hasn&#39;t quite made up her mind about him yet.&quot;\n\n&quot;It isn&#39;t as bad as that,&quot; Wheeler said. &quot;I can play the piano, and she thinks she can play the violin. I adapt the accompaniment to suit her timing, and everybody&#39;s happy.&quot;\n\n&quot;Miss Reesdale, eh?&quot; said Constable Smith, glancing more closely at Wheeler.\n\n&quot;What d&#39;you think of those postcards she&#39;s been receiving?&quot; asked Wheeler. &quot;D&#39;you think Pryde really is meditating some rough stuff? I advised her to go to the police.&quot;\n\n&quot;We&#39;re keeping watch for a while,&quot; said the constable. &quot;You never can tell.&quot;\n\n&quot;That collie of hers would give the alarm if she were attacked at night, I should think. Savage brute. Goes for everybody except her. And it isn&#39;t too friendly towards even her at times.&quot;\n\nThe constable, still surveying Wheeler keenly, nodded.\n\n&quot;That fellow Pryde gave her that dog,&quot; went on Wheeler, &quot;just before the burst-up. I suppose that accounts for it not taking to her too well. Still wants its original boss.&quot;\n\nAt this juncture P.C. Smith bade the two good night and returned to his vigil.\n\nTurning out into the darkened avenue, he made his way to the Retreat, and stood outside the garden railings of the little bungalow waiting for his sergeant, who would presently arrive to send him off duty.\n\nHe had waited there for about ten minutes, when he was startled by a noise within Miss Reesdale&#39;s bungalow.\n\nIt was the howling of a dog.\n\nSmith shone his torch through the kitchen window, and then, with the help of the sergeant, who arrived at this moment, burst open the back door.\n\nThey found Miss Reesdale lying on the floor of the drawing-room amidst overturned furniture.\n\nShe had been strangled to death.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nDigging Up Difficulties\n\nScotland Yard was notified in the morning, and Detective-Inspector Gray arrived later in a car belonging to his friend, Dixon Hawke, the latter&#39;s assistant, Tommy Burke, being at the wheel.\n\nGray had been at Hawke&#39;s flat when the phone-message came through, and it was the circumstance of the mysterious postcards that had interested Hawke.\n\n&quot;The first point of interest,&quot; said Hawke, &quot;is why, if that collie was roaming free inside the bungalow, with the room doors open, didn&#39;t it arouse the neighbours with its barking? You say there had been a policeman patrolling the avenue for several hours, too. Why didn&#39;t he hear anything?&quot;\n\n&quot;This fellow Wheeler must have doped it,&quot; said Gray.\n\n&quot;Wheeler? That chauffeur they say she&#39;s been friendly with? You&#39;re rushing things a bit, aren&#39;t you? Anyway, it will be known all right whether the dog was doped. It will be sick all day, and won&#39;t eat for some time.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, perhaps he just turned it out of doors.&quot;\n\n&quot;Before the murder? Necessarily before the murder. What would Miss Reesdale have to say about that? If she&#39;d been standing by to voice her protest there would have been a bit of a wrangle, which would have excited the animal and made it bark.\n\n&quot;Another point,&quot; persisted Hawke-&quot;The dog was found inside the bungalow. Is it your contention that, after he&#39;d committed the crime, this murderer went chasing about in the dark to round up the dog? If so, to what purpose?&quot;\n\n&quot;Perhaps it didn&#39;t want any rounding up. It may have been waiting on the doorstep, eager to be let in.&quot;\n\n&quot;And it went in when the murderer opened the door to come out, without making any fuss? Without attacking the man? Without even barking?&quot;\n\nGray frowned.\n\n&quot;What a man you are for digging up difficulties,&quot; he grunted. &quot;Anyway, what&#39;s the dog got to do with it? It&#39;s proved that Wheeler had been on visiting terms with Miss Reesdale. Her maid can tell us that. They had informal musical concerts, and were friendly enough to have petty quarrels. He was jealous of her all right, and, what&#39;s more, he was not at the Firs when the murder was committed. What was he doing roving about at that time of night?&quot;\n\n&quot;What about the postcards she&#39;d been receiving?&quot; asked Hawke.\n\n&quot;They used to be given away with film periodicals, and you could buy them in newsagents&#39; shops. He may have sent those to put the police off the trail.&quot;\n\nTommy had drawn the car up outside the Retreat, where stood a number of police officers.\n\n&quot;What a very unintelligent thing to do,&quot; said Hawke before alighting, &quot;seeing that Pryde was last heard of in America. Don&#39;t you really think he would have foreseen that Pryde would most probably have an alibi?&quot;\n\n&quot;I haven&#39;t overlooked that. I grant you it&#39;s one of the things that wants explaining. It occurred to me that Wheeler might have got to know Pryde&#39;s whereabouts through Miss Reesdale. He might have arranged it at a time when he know Pryde would have difficulty in proving an alibi. At a time, say, when Pryde actually intended visiting Miss Reesdale, Pryde might have written to her, and Wheeler might have got hold of the letter.&quot;\n\n&quot;While you&#39;re juggling with all those mights, couldn&#39;t you include the possibility that Pryde might have been the murderer?&quot;\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t be sarcastic, old man. Of course I include the possibility. But for the moment, we don&#39;t know of Pryde&#39;s movements at the material time, whereas we do know something of Wheeler&#39;s.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Treacherous Animal\n\nThe visitors were greeted by the local superintendent, who, before leading them into the dead actress&#39;s bungalow, pointed to a collie which a maid was holding on a lead.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s the only witness,&quot; said the officer with a grim smile.\n\nThe animal growled and bared its teeth.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s dog language,&quot; said Hawke, gazing at it half abstractedly.\n\nThe others were puzzled at the remark, for he made it almost as though he were serious.\n\n&quot;By Jove!&quot; exclaimed the superintendent suddenly. &quot;I do believe Mr. Hawke has some strange hypnotic power over dogs. Look.&quot;\n\nThe collie, which was standing before the man from Dover Street, had pricked up its ears in perky fashion, and begun vigorously wagging its tail. Its tongue lolled out, and it whinnied faintly as it strained on the leash in Hawke&#39;s direction.\n\nHawke put his hand out to pat its head and was almost bitten. The collie changed its tone and growled ferociously.\n\n&quot;Treacherous!&quot; exclaimed the superintendent. &quot;Treacherous beast that. Always was. No, I&#39;m afraid you haven&#39;t any dog-&#39;fluence, Mr. Hawke.&quot;\n\n&quot;Anyway,&quot; said Hawke, &quot;I know enough about dogs to feel assured that it has not been doped recently.&quot;\n\nThe party went inside the bungalow, and then proceeded to the Firs to interview Wheeler and his employer.\n\nHawke had his first glimpse of the latter before arriving at the Firs, the superintendent pointing him out through the window of the Retreat as soon as they got inside.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s go and have a talk to Foster and Wheeler,&quot; said Hawke after glancing over the disordered room.\n\nMr. Foster, whom they had just seen returning home from the seafront, was deeply concerned for Wheeler.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s true,&quot; he said, peeling off his coat after the callers had been invited inside, &quot;that he&#39;s only been in my service a few months, but he&#39;s a good lad, and I&#39;m going to get the best legal advice for him.&quot;\n\n&quot;You didn&#39;t engage him here in Wellington?&quot; queried Gray.\n\n&quot;No,&quot; answered Foster, &quot;in London. I advertised just after returning from Paris. I&#39;d just sold out some business interests there, and I came here for a bit of a rest.&quot;\n\nThe visitors then interviewed Wheeler who, white-faced and troubled, was going about his duties in the kitchen.\n\n&quot;I couldn&#39;t have done it,&quot; he protested. &quot;I couldn&#39;t possibly. That dog would have torn me to pieces, I tell you. It doesn&#39;t like me, and she used to have to chain it up every time I went there, and it usually barked until I&#39;d gone. Its barking used to interfere with our music.&quot;\n\nIt was certainly a strong point in his favour, but a little later Gray had triumphantly discovered a stronger point against him.\n\nA search of his belongings brought to light several of the picture-postcards such as had been sent to terrorise the dead woman.\n\n&quot;These wore never posted,&quot; said Gray when he discovered them in the pocket of one of Wheeler&#39;s coats. &quot;You overlooked &#39;em, eh? Didn&#39;t know you still had some left?&quot;\n\nThis, indeed, seemed to be the case. Wheeler went pale, stammered, and then made an unconvincing protest that he knew nothing about them.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Money Aspect\n\nThe Money Aspect\n\nWheeler was arrested, and Gray returned to Scotland Yard, Hawke having decided to stay on at Wellington-on-Sea for a while.\n\nHe and Tommy engaged rooms at the Esplanade Hotel, and it was in the lounge there that Hawke saw an aspect of the case which his Scotland Yard colleague had missed.\n\n&quot;When you look at the question of motive, Tommy,&quot; he said, &quot;you will find that Pryde, the indiarubber man, had quite substantial reasons for anger against Miss Reesdale.\n\n&quot;Quite apart from jealousy,&quot; he went on, &quot;there&#39;s the money aspect. No small matter that. As a team, Miss Reesdale and Ginger Pryde were a success, which meant very big money. As separate personalities, neither was much of a box-office attraction. Miss Reesdale didn&#39;t trouble much about this, it seems, and it&#39;s reasonable to suppose that Pryde would fix his spite on her as a result of his sudden loss of fortune.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s dropped right out of films and hasn&#39;t been heard of lately. No one knows where he is, so what&#39;s wrong with supposing that he might be here?&quot;\n\nIt was in the evening, after dinner, when Hawke made this pronouncement, and then he despatched Tommy on an errand, and made his way to the Firs.\n\nFoster was alone, and, having admitted Hawke to the drawing-room, he stood with his back to the fireplace and his hands thrust in his jacket-pockets.\n\n&quot;Well, Mr. Hawke,&quot; he said, &quot;what do you make of this business? Do you think we can do anything to help young Wheeler?&quot;\n\n&quot;Everything depends on what this indiarubber man might have to say for himself if and when he&#39;s found,&quot; said Hawke.\n\n&quot;Of course.&quot;\n\n&quot;Wheeler himself couldn&#39;t be the indiarubber man, and the latter&#39;s motive for murdering Miss Reesdale is quite strong.&quot;\n\n&quot;Have you any theories, Mr. Hawke, as to where this man might be found?&quot; asked Foster.\n\nHawke was silent for a space, and the two gazed steadily at one another.\n\n&quot;I have been trying to think,&quot; said Hawke, &quot;what would be the most effective sort of disguise for a man with red hair and very loose-skinned, rubbery features, and I thought of the possibility of his dyeing his hair black and growing a Large beard, also dyeing that black, of course.&quot;\n\nFoster helped himself to a drink and sipped it.\n\n&quot;That isn&#39;t too subtle for me, Mr. Hawke,&quot; he said. &quot;I can guess your drift. You mean you suspect me.&quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s a very tough beard,&quot; said Hawke smoothly. &quot;Fair hair,&quot; he went on, &quot;is the finest in texture. Black hair is somewhat coarser, and red hair is the toughest and wiriest of all.&quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s not an invariable rule, though,&quot; pointed out Foster. &quot;I hope you&#39;ve a rather more substantial reason than that for making these insinuations, my friend.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nIdentity Established\n\nAt this point there was a knock at the front door, and, glaring at Hawke, Foster moved out into the hall to answer it.\n\nHawke stepped swiftly to the door of the drawing-room and watched his back as he was pulling open the front door.\n\nA startling development ensued, though it was only Foster who was startled.\n\nOutside the front door stood Tommy, who had just released the late Miss Reesdale&#39;s collie from its lead.\n\nThe animal sprang into the hall, bounded up against Foster, placed its paws on his chest, and licked his Lace, wagging its tail the while.\n\n&quot;Bruce, drat you, get down!&quot; shouted Foster, and then stiffened as though suddenly realising that he had betrayed himself.\n\n&quot;I sent my assistant round to the local R.S.P.C.A. officer to collect it for a little experiment,&quot; said Hawke.\n\n&quot;I was vain enough to think it was making friendly advances to me this morning,&quot; he went on, &quot;and was startled by its treachery in snapping at my hand when I tried to stroke it. As we entered the Retreat you passed by, and I realised that the dog had been looking at you, and not at me.&quot;\n\nA short silence ensued.\n\n&quot;The dog recognised its master by his walk, his footsteps, and his scent,&quot; went on Hawke, &quot;and, of course, was not deceived by the dye or the beard.&quot;\n\n&quot;So you think you&#39;ve now fastened the murder on me, do you?&quot; gritted Foster.\n\n&quot;I suggest that it was your shadow that P.C. Smith saw, and I also suggest that you are the only person who could have kept the dog quiet. Whatever its master did would be right in the animal&#39;s estimation, and you would only have to tell it to keep quiet and it would obey you.&quot;\n\n&quot;You haven&#39;t proved a thing yet.&quot;\n\n&quot;Perhaps not. But it&#39;s now up to you to disprove that you are Pryde. A simple chemical test of your hair — &quot;\n\nIt suddenly became startlingly evident that during the interview the bearded man had been suppressing a tremendous anger, which now became too much for him to contain.\n\nLittle further evidence of his identity was needed than that which was now forthcoming.\n\nThe frightful expression which contorted his face established him as the wanted man beyond all doubt.\n\nHe made a rush at Hawke, and the dog did the same.\n\nTommy peeled off his jacket, threw it over the animal&#39;s head, and dragged it back.\n\nHawke meanwhile found himself engaged in a strenuous and thoroughly disconcerting struggle.\n\nHe seized one of his adversary&#39;s arms and bent it back into a position which would have rendered an ordinary man helpless. But there seemed no limit to the flexibility of the arm, and the man wriggled out of his grip seemingly without difficulty, at the same time throwing a muscular arm round Hawke&#39;s neck and heaving him violently on to his back.\n\nAware of the snarling and scuffling in the background as Tommy struggled to hold the dog secure, Hawke continued the fight.\n\nHe exerted all his strength in an effort to throw the man from a leg-hold, but failed. The man went over, but his body did not touch the floor, his arms, of which there seemed to be more than one pair, swinging round to save him. Then his body curled and twisted uncannily, and he thrust the sole of his foot in Hawke&#39;s face.\n\nWhen the detective, dazed and bleeding at the nose, picked himself up, he saw the other flying out of the front door.\n\nHawke paused for a moment to help Tommy to tie the arms of the jacket round the snarling, frantically-struggling dog, and then the pair of them rushed off in pursuit.\n\nA car engine had started up at the side of the house.\n\nA splintering crash indicated the smashing of a garage-door, and then they were nearly run over as the car flew down the drive.\n\nIt was an open car, and both of them managed to get a grip on the side of it as it flashed by.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nPryde Takes a Fall!\n\nThe vehicle lurched crazily out into Seaview Avenue, and then Hawke attempted to deflect the steering-wheel while standing on the running-board.\n\nTommy meanwhile climbed into the back seat and threw his arms about the man&#39;s powerful shoulders.\n\n&quot;Better jump, you fools,&#39;&#39; screamed Pryde, alias Foster. &quot;I killed her, and this is the end of me. I&#39;m going to drive over the cliff!&quot;\n\nHe put his foot down on the accelerator, and, at the same time bent back his left arm at an unnatural angle and heaved Tommy clean over the side of the car.\n\nThey had left the road, fortunately for the youth, and he pitched in a clump of gorse on the ciifftop.\n\nHawke saw the moonlit cliff&#39;s edge rushing towards him at a tremendous pace, and then he jumped.\n\nThe car&#39;s momentum carried him on, and he came down within a few feet of the edge, and then slithered along until his legs were kicking out into space, when his desperately-clutching fingers found some roots.\n\nAs he hauled himself to safety he heard a succession of metallic crashes as the car hit a series of rocky ledges, and then a splash.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m all right,&#39;&#39; said Tommy as he joined his employer, &quot;but I reckon Pryde had a fall — sorry, no pun meant, sir — that ought to prove too much even for an indiarubber man.&quot;\n\nAnd so it proved.\n\nWheeler was released as soon as the bearded man&#39;s body was recovered from the sea some hours later.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

The conviction of the prisoner seemed certain, in spite of the fact that the evidence was purely circumstantial.\n\nThe attorney for the State was gathering up his papers at his table, upon which, facing the jury, stood a massive bronze bust of Beethoven, the composer. Beside the bust lay a cowboy&#39;s lariat. Nothing else.\n\nThe attorney was a square-jawed, deep-chested man with cold blue eyes set much too wide apart and a bristling gray pompadour brushed back from his massive, corrugated forehead.\n\nHe had handled the case well. It had been a difficult one. The method alleged to have been used by the murderer savored of dime novels. The appearance of the prisoner, too, had been hard to overcome.\n\nThe attorney admitted grudgingly as he let his cold, hard eyes rest for the fraction of a moment upon the boy sitting erect on the bench beside the girl, with his head thrown back, that it was hard to believe him guilty of a cunning, brutal murder, and harder to convince a jury that he had committed it.\n\nThe lad raised his eyes for an instant to the face of his accuser, just then, but there was no look of malice in them. He seemed merely to be endeavoring to fathom the reason for the vindictiveness that had just been directed against himself by this man whom he had known since boyhood.\n\nHe was not the conventional, beetle-browed murder suspect. Indeed, he was the one person in the crowded courtroom who seemed out of place there. He was a little above average height — the dark head of the girl seated on the bench beside him came just above his shoulders — and slender; not slight, but slender with the vigorous slenderness of youth. His eyes were blue, large and very clear, and his hair was crisp, and sandy from habitual exposure to the elements.\n\nIt was early afternoon. A hush lay over the crowded courtroom following the closing announcement of the attorney for the State. It was the courtroom of a small Western city at the foot of the snow-clad Sierra-Nevadas. A ray of the warm winter sun entering through the grimy window lay upon the judge&#39;s silvery hair. The judge raised his watery eyes and glanced out at the snow-covered court house square where a gang of men with shovels were making a path for himself and his court to walk home upon. It had been snowing steadily all morning.\n\nDuring the pause in the proceedings the constable left his post at the door to replenish the fire in the stove. He was a young man and big, a typical Western small town constable, broad-shouldered and ruddy-faced. His uniform was painfully new. He moved with clumsy momentousness on tiptoe across the floor, opened the door of the stove and placed two pine knots upon the bright embers with slow deliberation, as if to invest this simple act with some of the importance he felt.\n\nThen he closed the door of the stove, softly, and started back on tiptoe to his post. As he passed the table of the defendant&#39;s counsel, the lawyer looked up and said to him:\n\n&quot;Take the stand, Ed, please.&quot;\n\nThe constable glanced at the prosecuting attorney as if for permission. Then he mounted the steps of the witness box, slowly, and upon being sworn in by the clerk, sat down. For several minutes he remained in his seat without movement, his elbows on the arm of the chair and his stubbled chin resting in the hollow of his great, hairy paw, waiting for the attorney for the defense to begin.\n\nAll eyes were turned upon the prisoner&#39;s counsel, seated at his table near the accused and the girl, slightly in advance of them.\n\nThe attorney was a heavy, ponderous-looking man. His face, the color of putty, was full and shaven smoothly. His eyes were large and china blue, and his coarse hair lay plastered, untidily, about his temples.\n\nHis garments were obtrusively comfortable. His coat fitted him like a sack hung over a gate-post and his trousers bagged, scandalously, at the knees.\n\nThe short, stubby fingers of his right hand rested on the edge of the table. His attitude was serene and unruffled. He did not seem in the least disconcerted with the task before him — the task of discrediting the avalanche of circumstantial evidence that had piled itself upon his client.\n\nHe sat relaxed in his chair looking at the constable on the witness stand as if he were bored at the task of having to cross-examine him. He seemed in no hurry to proceed, but at the impatient movement of the judge, he finally said in a soft, lazy drawl:\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going to ask you to re-construct the crime as you think it was committed, Ed.&quot;\n\nThe witness blinked his eyes. He glanced, inquiringly, at the prosecuting attorney upon whose face a sneer of contempt rode. The attorney nodded, reassuringly.\n\nArising, counsel for the defense crossed to his opponent&#39;s table and took from it the cowboy&#39;s lariat and the bronze bust of Beethoven.\n\n&quot;With your permission,&quot; he drawled, blandly, to the prosecutor.\n\nWalking to the witness-box, he placed bust and lariat on the broad railing before the officer.\n\nThen he returned to his seat at the table.\n\n&quot;Now, then, Ed, Show us how you think it was done,&quot; he said.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Witness&#39;s Story\n\nThe witness ran his heavy fingers through his hair with a helpless sort of motion. He was painfully flustered, but pulling himself together, he rose, picked up the lariat and uncoiled it.\n\n&quot;Well, it was something like this, I think,&quot; he began vaguely.\n\nHis embarrassment was painful. With a twist of his wrist he threw the noose of the lariat over the head of the bronze bust, and pulled the noose tight.\n\n&quot;The window of his room,&quot; he said with a jerk of his head at the prisoner, &quot;is twenty feet from the ground directly above the spot where I found his uncle&#39;s body. I figured that he dropped this bust on the old man&#39;s head from the window, then pulled the bust up with the lariat — afterwards — like this.&quot;\n\nThe witness let the fifteen-pound bronze drop over the railing of the witness box, then raised it again with the lariat, and placed it once more on top of the railing.\n\nCounsel for the defense smiled, approvingly.\n\n&quot;Not bad for an amateur detective, Ed. That thing dropped twenty feet would cave a man&#39;s head in, all right. What, may I ask, suggested this ingenious method to you?&quot;\n\nCounsel&#39;s tone was pleasantly interrogative. There was no hint of ridicule in his voice. Nevertheless, the witness shot him a quick, suspicious glance.\n\n&quot;When I examined his room, I found this lariat coiled on the bust,&quot; he explained, gaining confidence. &quot;As there wasn&#39;t any window or door on the ground floor at that end of the houses from which he could have struck the blow that killed his uncle, nor any foot-tracks in the snow except the old man&#39;s, I figured that this was the way he must have done it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very clever, Ed,&quot; the prisoner&#39;s attorney drawled. &quot;Very!&quot;\n\nHe stuck his thumbs into the armholes of his vest and surveyed the officer, head cocked to one side.\n\n&quot;Let me see, Ed — you&#39;ve been constable of Cardinal for nearly a year now, haven&#39;t you?&quot; he asked.\n\nThe witness nodded.\n\n&quot;A year on the twenty-fifth of this month,&quot; he replied.\n\n&quot;You&#39;d like to be sheriff of Cardinal County, wouldn&#39;t you, Ed?&quot;\n\nThe witness looked about with a vague smile.\n\n&quot;Well, yes, Colonel,&quot; he said. &quot;Who wouldn&#39;t?&quot;\n\nThe attorney smiled back.\n\n&quot;Your chances are pretty good —  now, Ed, ain&#39;t they?&quot; he asked ungrammatically, but with the merest shade of emphasis upon the word &quot;now.&quot;\n\n&quot;I suppose so! Everybody knows me. I was born and raised here,&quot; the witness replied, with due modesty.\n\nThe attorney nodded acquiescence. &quot;I know, Ed. Your chances are particularly bright now — since you have so ably assisted the State in this prosecution, I mean.&quot;\n\nHe was still smiling but a sort of grating edge had crept into his drawl. A barely audible titter ran through the crowded courtroom. The prosecuting attorney was known to have political ambitions. A successful conviction of murder — the first murder in the county in twenty years — would count greatly for him in the coming election. This star witness who had aided him so ably was sure not to be forgotten by him.\n\nThe witness moved uneasily.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know about that, Colonel,&quot; he snapped with a sudden show of resentment. &quot;I did my duty, that&#39;s all.&quot; The prosecutor was on his feet, his hard eyes flashing.\n\n&quot;I object to the discrediting of the witness by personal and irrelevant observations,&quot; he stormed. &quot;The officer is known to us as a reputable citizen.&quot;\n\n&quot;There you go again, Warren,&quot; the defendant&#39;s counsel drawled, querulously. &quot;Losing your temper over nothing.&quot;\n\nThe judge frowned. He glanced from one to the other and sighed. Both men, prosecutor and defender, were his friends — outside the courtroom. The three of them had seen Cardinal grow from a collection of miners&#39; tents to a city of some importance. He had proper respect for his profession, but he was not going to permit mere court routine to shatter a friendship of thirty years&#39; standing, so he said in a tone of diplomatic deprecation to the defendant&#39;s counsel:\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll have to sustain the objection, Colonel. Please proceed.&quot;\n\nBefore the attorney for the State sat down, he said in a withering tone to his opponent:\n\n&quot;If you don&#39;t lose your temper a dozen times before you&#39;re through, I&#39;ll miss my guess, Melvin Edgerly.&quot;\n\n&quot;Gentlemen! You&#39;re in the court!&quot; the judge reminded them, with some show of severity.\n\nThe prisoner&#39;s counsel did not reply to the observation of his opponent. He glanced back at the dark-haired girl on the bench beside the prisoner, then turned to the witness again.\n\n&quot;I was just trying to bring out, Ed, how sure you are that you&#39;re going to be our next Sheriff.&quot; He jerked one stubby thumb over his shoulder at the girl. &#39;&#39;If you had been half as sure of getting Laura, there, there&#39;d be wedding bells along with your inauguration, I guess.&quot;\n\nA wave of suppressed amusement passed through the crowd. The young constable&#39;s unsuccessful wooing of Laura Hamilton was common knowledge. Someone in one of the rear seats emitted a loud guffaw.\n\nThe judge pounded his gavel.\n\n&quot;Another such disturbance and I&#39;ll order the courtroom cleared!&quot; he thundered.\n\nThe face of the witness burned a dull red. The girl on the bench beside the boy dropped her eyes. Her long, dark eyelashes lay like two crescents of jet against the clear pallor of her skin. The prisoner&#39;s hand stole out in protecting reassurance. His eyes were fastened upon the broad, untidy back of his attorney as if he were trying to read, there, the motives responsible for the man&#39;s ill-timed digression.\n\nThe counsel consulted his notes.\n\n&quot;Were you alone in your office, Ed, on the morning of the fourteenth when the accused called up on the telephone and informed you that his uncle had been killed?&quot; he asked, after a pause.\n\n&quot;I was,&quot; the witness snapped.\n\n&quot;It was eight o&#39;clock when the telephone rang, I believe you stated before?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot;\n\n&quot;You are sure about the time?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, sure.&quot;\n\n&quot;Looked at your watch, I suppose?&quot;\n\n&quot;No, but I get down to the office at a quarter to eight every morning. I had been in only a short time when the telephone rang.&quot;\n\n&quot;I see. You went directly to the place?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes. I closed my desk and left at once.&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you can tell us exactly to the minute when you arrived at the scene of — the tragedy?&quot;\n\n&quot;I can. It was ten minutes to nine,&quot; the officer asserted with snappy positiveness. &quot;I looked at my watch as I walked across the field to the house.&quot;\n\nThe attorney glanced at the ceiling. He seemed to be thinking.\n\n&quot;The distance from your office in the city hall to the house is about one mile,&quot; he said. &quot;Am I right?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot;\n\n&quot;It took you from eight o&#39;clock to ten minutes to nine — fifty minutes, to cover the distance of one mile?&quot;\n\n&quot;The road was in a bad condition,&quot; the witness explained, tersely. &quot;It had been thawing heavily all night. I had to stop every little while to stamp the snow off my boots.&quot;\n\n&quot;I see. If it hadn&#39;t been thawing so unusually hard all night, you could have made the distance in much less time —  in say twenty-five minutes?&quot;\n\n&quot;Twenty minutes, easy,&quot; the witness corrected. &quot;I&#39;m a fast walker.&quot;\n\nThe colonel pursed his lips. He glanced at the judge, then transferred his gaze to the jury. When he spoke again, he seemed to be addressing no one in particular.\n\n&quot;The weather records show that it started thawing at ten-thirty the night before. I guess the canyon road must have been in pretty bad shape, all right. It was the heaviest thaw on record for this time of the year, since 1912.&quot;\n\nHe paused and leaned back in his chair and regarded the witness, musingly.\n\n&quot;After you had taken charge of the body,&quot; he resumed, &quot;you looked around the house and found to your surprise that with the exception of your own foot tracks, there were no tracks leading to or from the house in any direction. That was what first directed your suspicion against my client, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;\n\n&quot;It was. It stopped snowing at five o&#39;clock the night before. He, — &quot; here the constable pointed a heavy finger at the prisoner — &quot;told me that the last time he saw his uncle alive was at ten o&#39;clock the night before, when the old man was walking up and down outside the house, smoking. It did not snow after that,&quot; he added, triumphantly.\n\n&quot;So you jumped to the conclusion that my client had murdered his uncle because there were no foot-tracks in the snow?&quot;\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t jump at nothing,&quot; the witness asserted with asperity. &quot;It was clear that the man who killed old Sargent had never left the house — unless he came and went by aeroplane,&quot; he added with sarcasm.\n\n&quot;And then, being that my client was the only other occupant of the house, besides the dead man,&quot; the colonel went on, imperturbably, &quot;you decided that he had killed his uncle, and arrested him on the spot, on your own responsibility, and without a warrant?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, I wasn&#39;t going to give him a chance to make a get-away,&quot; the constable defended.\n\n&quot;Very thoughtful of you, Ed,&quot; the counsel drawled. &quot;That&#39;ll be all.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nOut of Order\n\nWhen the witness had resumed his post at the door, the colonel said, turning to the court:\n\n&quot;It has been pointed out by the prosecution that my client was Mr. Sargent&#39;s only heir. That an estate of something like a hundred thousand dollars would come to him upon his uncle&#39;s death. That he is engaged to be married to a girl whom his uncle objected to, strongly, because of an old grudge against her father, which I think we are all familiar with,&quot; he added, with a glance about him.\n\n&quot;My client has admitted that, sir. Sargent had forbidden him, under pains of disinheriting him, to even see the girl again. It has also been proven beyond a doubt that the two men quarreled a great deal of late — presumably over my client&#39;s choice of a wife.&quot;\n\nThe prisoner and the girl exchanged glances of blank amazement. Even the prosecuting attorney moved, restlessly, in his chair. The judge frowned, ponderously, and a murmur of disapproval passed over the spectators. The counsel for the defense was apparently throwing up his hands and convicting his client all over again instead of defending him, and he, the counsel alone, seemed oblivious of this fact. He paused briefly, then went on in his lazy drawl:\n\n&quot;Did it occur to the court that a man with as many good reasons for committing this murder as my client had, would be a fool — nay, insane — to do so? He would automatically sign his own death-warrant by such an act, and that if he was cunning enough to employ the method suggested by the prosecution, he would not possibly have overlooked the necessity of making a trail in the snow to and from the house. A trail would have been absolutely necessary to the success of his plan. By not doing so, would you have us believe that he deliberately planned that suspicion be directed toward him? It would have been an easy matter to have slipped on a pair of old shoes, and have walked down to the road and back again, and destroyed, or hidden the shoes afterwards. Even destroying the shoes would not have been necessary. The thaw would have enlarged the footprints to such an extent that identification would have been impossible.&quot; He paused and regarded the jury through half-closed lids.\n\n&quot;It has been established by the prosecution that my client is a man of ordinary intellect. Such a man would not possibly have overlooked the most vital part of his scheme. He might have overlooked some trifling detail, as the brainiest of criminals do at times, but that he should have forgotten to fake a set of tracks when the snow was there, as it were to order, for a perfect alibi, is utterly absurd.&quot;\n\nThe attorney for the State arose.\n\n&quot;I object to generalities and farfetched presumptions being used to discredit established facts,&quot; he insisted, coldly.\n\nThe colonel interrupted him.\n\n&quot;You have established no fact, if you please, Warren, except the fact that Mr. Sargent is dead. Anyone can assure himself of that by visiting the morgue.&quot; He turned to the court. &quot;I ask your Honor to overrule the objection on the ground that the State is basing its conviction on circumstantial evidence, and that we of the defense are endeavoring to present the court with as strong a chain of circumstantial evidence for acquittal. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.&quot;\n\nThe attorney for the State emitted a harsh laugh. The court frowned, perplexedly.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re out of order, Colonel,&quot; the judge said, &quot;still. I&#39;ll let it stand if you can show good reason for it.&quot;\n\n&quot;I will show — good reason, presently,&quot; counsel asserted, mildly.\n\nHe turned about in his chair and nodded to a very tall and very old man, seated, chair tip-tilted, a short distance to his right, directly under the witness-stand. The man brought the front legs of his chair to the floor with a thump, arose and mounted the three steps to the witness box. He did not sit down, but remained standing waiting to be sworn in. Even before the clerk had fully finished administering the oath to him, his clear &quot;Yes&quot; rang out as a challenge upon the still courtroom.\n\nThe attorney for the defense leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes for a moment, as if to select his words carefully before addressing the witness. Then he said:\n\n&quot;Dr. Shale, will you please show the court what you found when you performed the mortual examination upon Mr. Sargent?&quot;\n\nWithout replying, the witness took from his pocket a leather wallet. Opening it, he took from it a small object, which he held up between his thumb and fore-finger.\n\n&quot;This,&quot; he said, briefly.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Feather\n\nNecks were craned in his direction. The jurymen leaned forward in their seats, and the judge adjusted his spectacles. The prosecuting attorney stared at the object with a frown, half of annoyance, half of contempt — then transferred his gaze to the face of his opponent, who sat slumped in his chair, seemingly the least interested of anybody.\n\nThe prisoner and the girl exchanged glances.\n\nThe tension was broken by the Colonel saying in his soft, crooning voice:\n\n&quot;Please tell the court where you found that — pigeon&#39;s feather, Dr. Shale.&quot;\n\n&quot;I found it imbedded in the dead man&#39;s brain, three inches below the skull.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;ll be all. Doctor, thanks,&quot; counsel said.\n\nWhen the witness returned to his seat he leaned over and laid the feather upon the table beside the prisoner&#39;s counsel. The colonel picked it up and placed it upon his blotter in plain sight of the court.\n\nThe prosecuting attorney scowled at Dr. Shale. The coroner&#39;s verdict had been: &quot;Death from blow upon the head. Cause unknown.&quot; He had refused point-blank to return an indictment for murder upon the evidence submitted, so Attorney Warren had gone ahead on his own account.\n\n&quot;Pigeon&#39;s feather!&quot; he scoffed. &quot;Nothing of the sort! Swallow&#39;s feather, that&#39;s what it is.&quot;\n\n&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; There was irritation in the colonel&#39;s voice for the first time. &quot;It&#39;s a pigeon&#39;s feather.&quot;\n\nThe jurymen looked at one another. Most of them knew a pigeon&#39;s feather when they saw one and all of them were positive that the object on the colonel&#39;s blotter — a slim, steel-blue feather —  was not a pigeon&#39;s.\n\nA cynical smile played about the corners of the prosecutor&#39;s thin lips.\n\n&quot;If you expect to win this case on ornithological decisions, you&#39;d better take a week off and study up on the subject, Melvin Edgerly,&quot; he sneered. &quot;I&#39;ll stake my reputation, legal and otherwise, that the feather on your blotter is a swallow&#39;s feather. I think I know what I&#39;m talking about. I didn&#39;t get my degree in ornithology at Standford for nothing.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s so,&quot; the colonel admitted, suddenly. &quot;I remember now, you used to be bugs on birds&#39; nests, and eggs, and things, when you were a kid, Warren.&quot;\n\n&quot;It was my hobby, if that&#39;s what you mean,&quot; the prosecutor replied, stiffly.\n\nThe colonel might have observed here that robbing the nests of inoffensive songsters for the purpose of studying them was more of a cruelty than a hobby, but he forebore. Instead he leaned forward in his chair, and, fastening his china blue eyes on the prosecutor&#39;s face, said calmly:\n\n&quot;For the purpose of securing expert testimony on a question of ornithology, I hereby subpoena you, Robert Warren, as a witness for the defense. Take the stand, please.&quot;\n\nThe prosecutor&#39;s jaw dropped. &quot;What!&quot;\n\nHe looked about him appealingly, at this unheard of procedure.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s unethical, I know, Warren,&quot; the colonel sighed, deprecatingly, &quot;but I&#39;m within my rights.&quot;\n\nHe turned to the judge. &quot;How about it, your Honor?&quot; he asked.\n\n&quot;I — I suppose so, Colonel,&quot; the judge replied, helplessly, &quot;but — but — &quot; he ended lamely.\n\n&quot;I won&#39;t — be made a monkey of before the court,&quot; the prosecutor stormed, shaking his fist at the colonel. &quot;I refuse — !&quot;\n\n&quot;Gentle — men!&quot; the judge admonished. He turned to the outraged attorney. &quot;Better take the stand, Warren, before I&#39;m forced to fine you for contempt of court.&quot;\n\n&quot;All right — !&quot; the attorney snapped, subsiding.\n\nHe stalked to the witness chair, suffered himself to be sworn in, then shot his opponent a baleful glance. The colonel looked up, blandly, and handed him the feather.\n\n&quot;Please tell the court in your own terms — scientific terms — if you wish, how you know that this is a swallow&#39;s feather.&quot;\n\nThe witness cleared his throat, and pulled himself together.\n\nFor three minutes steady he explained to the court how he knew that the feather in his hand was a swallow&#39;s feather. Warming up to his subject, he forgot, momentarily, his anger at his opponent&#39;s unethical conduct. He went into details about the differences between the feathers of birds of prey and those of song-birds, and the comparative wing-power of the different species. He even touched upon the subject of protective coloration.\n\nWhen he was through there was not a man in the courtroom who doubted for a moment that the feather in his hand was a swallow&#39;s feather, and when the prisoner&#39;s attorney excused him he went back to his table conscious of having won another victory over the defense.\n\nHe replaced the feather upon his own table beside the bronze bust and sat down. A smile rode across his heavy jowl. A verdict of guilty seemed a foregone conclusion, now. By his rambling digressions the prisoner&#39;s counsel had strengthened the case of the State, instead of weakening it, and now the counsel seemed to realize it for the first time. He sat slumped back in his chair with his stubby fingers interlocked across his loose-fitting vest, his putty-like face sunk deep in apparent gloom.\n\nOnly his china blue eyes were alert. Those who sat near him noted the odd, veiled look that had crept into them.\n\n&quot;Please proceed. Colonel.&quot;\n\nThe judge&#39;s voice roused him to action. Running his hand into his pocket, he pulled out an old thumb-marked note-book, opened it and took from it a feather identical with the one on the prosecutor&#39;s table. Leaning over he laid the second feather beside the first one.\n\n&quot;I took this one from a swallow&#39;s nest under the eaves of Sargent&#39;s house just above my client&#39;s window,&quot; he said, in a flat, colorless tone, as if it concerned no one.\n\nThe jurymen looked at one another, then at their foreman. They sensed that something momentous was about to be presented to them. The colonel glanced their way, but not at them. He seemed to be regarding some point above their heads, beyond them.\n\n&quot;Upon one of the wooden brackets supporting the eaves, I found a deep gouge, torn out of the soft redwood by some hard object striking it.&quot; His voice rose to a slightly sharper pitch as he went on. &quot;The bracket is two feet above my client&#39;s window and four feet below the lowest point of the eaves.&quot;\n\nArising, he walked to the window near the judge&#39;s bench, opened it and ran down the upper sash. The window was in direct line of vision of the jurymen. Pulling an old-fashioned Colts forty-five from his pocket, he raised the pistol and fired it upward through the half-open sash.\n\nThe entire courtroom was on its feet before the report had died away. The judge towered, menacingly, above the man who had dared to disturb the tranquillity of his court in such an unheard of manner. His eyes were flashing, but they grew wide with amazement when a heavy, transparent object shot by the window and struck the cement pavement outside, with a report louder than the discharge of the pistol.\n\nJudge, prosecutor and jury crowded about the window and looked out. Upon the sidewalk under the window lay the shattered remains of a huge icicle.\n\nThe counsel for the defense was speaking. His voice was no longer flat, nor colorless, nor even drawling:\n\n&quot;The feather which my learned colleague so obligingly and correctly classified as a swallow&#39;s feather became frozen to the point of a giant icicle that dropped from the eaves near the swallow&#39;s nest, and struck Old Sargent on the head, killing him instantly. The icicle in its downward course struck the redwood bracket, hence the gouge in the wood. The feather was driven three inches into Sargent&#39;s head by the force of the impact. The strong thaw which dislodged the icicle melted it away by morning, thus obliterating completely the weapon — if I may term it a weapon  — by which Mr. Sargent met his death. I ask the court to instruct the jury for acquittal.&quot;\n\nThe jurymen glanced at one another and nodded.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be necessary,&quot; the foreman said. &quot;Still, as a matter of routine, I suppose — &quot;\n\nHe smiled. &quot;You win, Colonel.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

In a few moments Mrs. Benvie, the housekeeper, announced Detective-Inspector Gray of Scotland Yard, and when Gray came into the room it was obvious from his face that he was in anything but a pleasant mood.\n\n&quot;Now look here, Hawke,&quot; he burst out as the private detective rose to his feet. &quot;Have you seen this man Jevons or haven&#39;t you? Serious business shielding a man wanted for murder. He was seen coming towards your flat, and  —  &quot;\n\n&quot;I have seen Jevons and his wife,&quot; admitted Hawke before Gray could say anything further. &quot;They are a young, intelligent couple, newly married, and the reason why I&#39;m unwilling to hand Jevons over to you yet is that I&#39;m convinced of his innocence. Listen. There are those two, making the best of uncongenial jobs as steward and stewardess of a low, riverside club at Wapping. Jevons has learned to deal with the tough characters who frequent the place, and he is involved in a dispute with one of them while his wife is upstairs cleaning the rooms and the proprietor Is in some other part of the building.\n\n&quot;The customer, a much-hated general dealer and moneylender named Blair, gets rough, and Jevons throws him down, so that he strikes his head on the iron leg of a table.\n\n&quot;At that point the proprietor enters the room, looks at the stunned man, and says to Jevons: &#39;You&#39;ve killed him! Better scoot before the police arrive.&#39; He then pushes Jevons out through the door, and, bewildered. Jevons hurries away a few paces, and then stops to think things over.\n\n&quot;He is about to return when he hears a scream and his wife comes rushing out. .She tells him that Blair is lying on the floor in a pool of blood. She can&#39;t find the proprietor, Mr. Howson, and, as there is no one else in the place, she is wondering what to do.\n\n&quot;&#39;Howson must have gone for the police,&#39; says Jevons. &#39;I didn&#39;t damage Blair as badly as all that. I can&#39;t understand it. Let&#39;s go back.&#39;\n\n&quot;But Mrs. Jevons is afraid to go back, and they stand there on the river foreshore at the foot of Blissett Hill, gaping at the club building and debating the matter for several minutes.\n\n&quot;&#39;He&#39;s dead,&#39; insists Mrs. Jevons. &#39;The floor&#39;s covered with blood. There&#39;s nothing you can do. Don&#39;t go back — it might make things worse for you.&#39; Then the police arrive, and the two hear one of the officers tell a colleague that Blair has been — stabbed to death.\n\n&quot;You will say that the next action of the Jevonses was unwise, and perhaps it was. They came to me to ask my advice.&quot;\n\n&quot;A jury would say they ran away,&quot; remarked Gray. &quot;And if your suggestion is that Howson stabbed Blair after Jevons left, I can only say that there&#39;s no evidence to support it. There&#39;s no trace of the knife, and the man who killed Blair must have got a lot of blood on his clothes.&quot;\n\n&quot;Jevons had none.&quot;\n\n&quot;I dare say he changed.&quot;\n\n&quot;Howson had more chance of changing. It transpires that he hadn&#39;t gone for the police at all. He telephoned them from the club. They were on the scene within a couple of minutes of receiving his phone message, but that was nearly ten minutes after Jevons had left the place.&quot;\n\n&quot;How are you going to prove that?&quot;\n\n&quot;It does seem that it&#39;s only Jevons&#39;s word against Howson&#39;s, but I shall try to find some means of establishing the time lag, which would prove that Howson gave himself time to change and dispose of the knife and his bloodstained clothing.&#39;&#39;\n\nGray rose and took his hat. &quot;I&#39;m expected to arrest Jevons within a few hours,&quot; he said significantly.\n\n&quot;In a few hours,&quot; returned Hawke, &quot;you shall have him, if you still want him by that time.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThrough the Telescope\n\nHalf an hour later Hawke and his assistant were viewing the riverside buildings from the deck of a steamer anchored in mid-river.\n\nOn his arrival on the river front, he had not been slow to note the ship&#39;s position in relation to the scene of the crime, and on hearing that she had been at anchor there, awaiting a berth, since the previous morning, his interest in her had intensified and he had immediately engaged a waterman to row him and his assistant out to her.\n\n&quot;All foreign people,&quot; said the man in the light blue boiler-jacket and black woollen cap, who was standing by Hawke&#39;s side on the steamer&#39;s deck, &quot;is a fool, an&#39; I t&#39;ink it good for a man to know when &#39;e&#39;s a foreign.&quot;\n\n&quot;You don&#39;t believe in going ashore and getting robbed in foreign ports, eh?&quot; smiled Hawke.\n\n&quot;I stop &#39;ere,&quot; answered the Swedish deckhand, &quot;an&#39; look at &#39;im t&#39;rough my spyglass. Dere ain&#39;t no end to de trouble a sailorsman can get into in de big town. An&#39; de big town just carry on an&#39; don&#39;t take no notice, not even if you get  —  &quot;\n\nHe drew his forefinger across his throat and made a bloodcurdling sound.\n\n&quot;What &#39;bout dis man what I see waitin&#39; dere wid de lady when de p&#39;lice come?&quot; went on the Swede. &quot;You say dey&#39;re after &#39;im for a murder what &#39;e don&#39;t done. What&#39;s de good to say it ain&#39;t dangerous ashore when you get a t&#39;ing like dat &#39;appen?&quot;\n\nHawke gazed thoughtfully across the smooth, green expanse of water towards Blissett Hill, which shelved steeply to the edge of the river, culminating in a flight of stone steps and a strip of muddy foreshore.\n\nHe borrowed the Swede&#39;s telescope, and focussed it on a certain building at the foot of this street.\n\nThe Corner Club was a dingy, three-storied house, and against its riverside wall was a decaying old landing-stage, long in disuse. Above the landing-stage was a window, which Hawke studied intently for some moments.\n\n&quot;I see one man in dere,&quot; said the Swede, &quot;after de man an&#39; de lady run out.&quot;\n\n&quot;A fat man?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, Fat.&quot;\n\n&quot;That would be Howson.&quot;\n\n&quot;I was lookin&#39;, because I t&#39;ink dere must be some troubles doin&#39;. T&#39;rough de window I see de fat one bend over an&#39; look at something on de floor. Den &#39;e go downstairs. Don &#39;bout ten minutes after, de p&#39;lice come.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re sure of the time?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes. Ten minutes. Not no less.&quot;\n\n&quot;That makes you an important witness. We shall be able to find you here?&quot;\n\n&quot;&#39;Ere till to-morrow morning&#39;s tide. Den we go into Jordan&#39;s dock.&quot;\n\n&quot;All right. We&#39;ll be getting in touch with you. It might be useful if you can keep an eye on that place while you&#39;re here.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Tell-Tale Buttons\n\nHawke and Tommy were rowed ashore once more, and they presently visited the Comer Club. They did not mingle with the customers, but entered through a side door, which gave access to a narrow lane leading to Blissett Street and to another street at the other end.\n\n&quot;Jevons assumed that Howson came out this way to fetch the police,&quot; remarked Hawke.\n\nA moment later he was confronting Howson in the dark passage inside the premises.\n\n&quot;I know the police have searched the place,&quot; he said in answer to the big, angry-faced man&#39;s query, after he had introduced himself, &quot;but they weren&#39;t looking for what I&#39;m looking for. They knew Jevons hadn&#39;t had time to change his clothes here, and so they weren&#39;t looking for traces of bloodstained attire.&quot;\n\n&quot;&#39;Ere, what you gettin&#39; at?&quot; asked Howson.\n\n&quot;I&#39;d rather make a search on my own in preference to falling back on the police — in case I&#39;m wrong.&quot;\n\nHowson hesitated for a moment, and then grunted his consent.\n\n&quot;I notice you have central heating,&quot; said Hawke. &quot;Let&#39;s have a look at your furnace-room.&quot;\n\nIn the dimly-lit furnace-room Hawke and Tommy were presently perspiring over a glowing heap of ashes which they had raked out.\n\nHowson, who had returned for a moment to the bar, shuffled up behind them.\n\n&quot;What the devil d&#39;you expect to find?&quot; he demanded.\n\nHawke, in his shirt-sleeves, turned and studied the man&#39;s face thoughtfully. The dancing flames from the furnace threw highlights over the coarse features, and seemed to bring out a hard glitter in the eyes.\n\n&quot;Buttons,&quot; he said. &quot;And I may say I&#39;ve found some.&quot;\n\nHowson grunted with an affectation of indifference.\n\n&quot;All sorts of rubbish gets chucked in there,&quot; he said. &quot;I dunno what you think it&#39;s supposed to prove.&quot;\n\n&quot;My belief is that the murderer of Blair destroyed his blood-stained clothes in this furnace, forgetting that the buttons would survive the flames. And these, I fancy, are the buttons in question. In conjunction with certain other significant little facts I&#39;ve discovered, it&#39;s likely to make quite weighty evidence.&quot;\n\nThe grunt was repeated.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve got to get back to the bar. I&#39;ll show you the rest of the cellars, so you can &#39;ave a proper nose round. I&#39;d hate you to miss anything.&quot;\n\nHowson led the way down a flight of stone steps and along a bricked tunnel to a dank, unlighted cellar, which Hawke correctly judged was next to the river.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Tight Spot\n\nHawke subsequently blamed himself for what transpired, but he was intent on examining the cellar by the light of his pocket-torch.\n\nHowson had struck a succession of matches, the last of which had gone out, and he stood by the doorway as the two visitors entered.\n\nThe detective had just satisfied himself that the cellar was absolutely bare when he heard a slight noise behind him and a cry from Tommy.\n\nHe reached the closing door too late. The key turned in the lock, and there was a sound of props being placed against it, though it was stout enough, being of ancient hardwood braced with iron.\n\nHowson made no reply to Hawke&#39;s shouts, and the two prisoners were at a loss to know what he expected to gain by his action.\n\nBoth had taken their coats and vests off in the furnace-room, and being still without these had not so much as a penknife between them. The cellar contained nothing but a quantity of coal dust.\n\nThey had been imprisoned about an hour when they heard a metallic clanking and heavy bumping on the other side of the river wall. The bumping came from somewhere beneath their feet, and after it had continued for a time Hawke hit on the explanation.\n\n&quot;The tide&#39;s out,&quot; he said, &quot;and Howson&#39;s driving holes through the foundation wall under the floor. That means the cellar will be flooded when the tide does come in. The water will come up through the cracks between the tiles in a score of places, and, according to my estimation, the tide rises above the level of this ceding.&quot;\n\n&quot;But I can&#39;t believe it! &quot; said Tommy. &quot; How does he think he&#39;s going to get away with it?&quot;\n\n&quot;He knows we have him nailed,&quot; said Hawke, &quot;and, having committed one murder, he&#39;s prepared to commit others to save himself. He&#39;ll probably try to stage it as an accident, making out that we were unwittingly locked in here. Or he may have other plans for disposing of our remains. We&#39;ve got to find some way of getting out. What have you in the way of escape tools, Tommy? I have a tobacco-pipe and a box of matches.&quot;\n\n&quot;I have a pencil and a few copper coins,&quot; said Tommy.\n\n&quot;Now,&quot; said Hawke, after a long pause, &quot;are those things adequate tools for effecting an escape?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m afraid not,&quot; said Tommy, somewhat surprised at his chief&#39;s brisk tone.\n\n&quot;Wrong,&quot; said Hawke, switching on his pocket-torch. &quot;Use one of your coins to lever up a tile from the floor, and scrape me up some clay. Meanwhile, give me your pencil.&quot;\n\nHawke took the pencil and bit into it, splitting it longitudinally. He then removed the lead, and put the empty casing in his trouser-pocket.\n\nHe filled the bowl of his pipe with coal dust, and then, tilting it over, held a succession of matches to it until the coal had begun to glow. Taking the small quantity of dirty clay that Tommy had laboriously scratched up, he packed it over the top of the bowl, sealing it.\n\nMoving over to the door, Hawke applied a match to the stem, and a tiny blue flame shot out. Applying the flame to the door just above the lock, and using the deleaded pencil as a blowpipe, he sent a pin-point of intense heat against the woodwork.\n\nThe paint blistered and crackled, and pungent smoke arose, but progress was exasperatingly slow.\n\n&quot;Our coal-gas retort will need further charging before we&#39;re through,&quot; Hawke said presently. &quot;Put some of that coal-dust in your pockets before it gets wet.&quot;\n\nHe presently tipped out the burnt ashes, and put fresh coal dust on top of that which glowed at the bottom of the bowl.\n\n&quot;If I can burn sufficiently far into the wood, right round the lock,&quot; he explained as he did this, &quot;it might be possible to kick the lock clean out.&quot;\n\nThe wood smouldered and sparked at the edge of the tiny cut he made, but was too old and hard to catch fire.\n\nAfter an hour he had made a cut right through the door about five inches long. The water was then sluicing icily about their knees.\n\nAs he gained experience of the job he was able to make slightly faster progress, though the pungent wood smoke stung his eyes and caught his throat.\n\nHe had been at work two and a half hours, and had cut round three sides of the lock when the bowl of his pipe, which he had been holding with a handkerchief, burned completely through.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nBehind Brick Walls\n\nHawke pressed on the lock with the ball of his fist. The water was now almost level with the lock.\n\n&quot;It gives a little, I think,&quot; he said, and, stepping back, raised his foot to kick against it with his heel.\n\nAt this juncture there was a development that made it seem as though the fates were making a mockery of them.\n\nThe water surged violently, as though disturbed by some wallowing monster, and its level rose abruptly, reaching Hawke&#39;s shoulders and submerging Tommy.\n\nThe latter bobbed above the surface, gasping. Hawke was standing close up against the door.\n\n&quot;Hold on to the comer of the door frame,&quot; he said, &quot;and float. The tide&#39;s been rising faster outside than in here and the pressure has caused some of the tiles to give. I&#39;ve pushed the lock through, and I&#39;m just struggling to get my leg out of the hole.&quot;\n\nThe door still refused to budge, on account of the props outside.\n\nHawke presently ducked below the surface of the water, came up for breath, and repeated the operation.\n\nThe third time he came up triumphantly waving a crowbar that he had dragged through the hole in the door.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve knocked all the props away,&quot; he reported. &quot;Push! &quot;\n\nThey were drawing breath from within a few inches of the ceiling when, holding on to the top of the door frame, and making a last strenuous effort, they managed to push the door open.\n\nThey drew a final breath within the cellar, ducked under the doorway, and swam to the end of the tunnel.\n\nThe door at the top of the stone steps was locked, but it was a flimsy proposition in comparison with the other one, and Hawke shouldered it open.\n\nA peep into the furnace-room revealed that they had lost their coats and vests, these pieces of evidence presumably having gone into the boiler fire.\n\nBy turning at the top of the stairs and crawling past a bar-hatch, the two were able to escape by the side door unobserved, and Hawke was presently telephoning the police.\n\n* * *\n\nAfter his arrest, Howson asserted that Hawke and Tommy had been locked in accidentally, but this bluff, apart from its apparent thinness, was quite useless. The Swedish deckhand, from his vantage-point aboard the ship in mid-river, had seen him knocking the holes in the foundation wall.\n\n&quot;You&#39;ve seen more from the deck of your ship,&quot; said Hawke, &quot;than most people ever see ashore.&quot;\n\n&quot;P&#39;raps,&quot; agreed the Swede, &quot;but dere&#39;s a mighty lot goes on behind brick walls what you don&#39;t never see.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; agreed Hawke fervently. &quot;Yes, my friend. You are right there.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Her color faded as quickly as if all the blood in her veins had surged to her heart. Through the meshes of her gray veil, her dilating eyes were fixed with startled, staring scrutiny upon the man&#39;s motionless hand — and its one adornment.\n\nShe lingered only for a moment, unheard, unnoticed, and then she went to sit at a desk in one corner, still furtively watching the man, but with her fair face partly averted. She had just entered the Stability Trust Company, a New York banking institution, and approached one of the wall desks to write a deposit slip. Incidentally, when nearly behind a fashionably clad man, who was writing a check, she noticed his left hand, on the check book.\n\nAt the receiving teller&#39;s window, a little later, while passing in her deposit, she inquired carelessly:\n\n&#39;&#39;Did you see the tall gentleman. Mr. Raymond, who cashed a check and went out a few moments ago?&quot;\n\nMr. Raymond smiled at her through the lattice, and bowed.\n\n&quot;I did,&quot; he replied. &quot;He is a personal friend of mine. His name is Hamilton Fisk.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thank you. He reminded me of a friend who lives in Denver.&quot;\n\n&quot;Mr. Fisk lives at the Waldron. He is one of our depositors.&quot;\n\n&quot;I was merely impressed with the resemblance mentioned — nothing more. The last was added with noticeable indifference.\n\nNevertheless, upon entering a handsome Fifth Avenue residence, half an hour later, this same young lady hastened to call up the police headquarters and ask for Detective Glidden.\n\n&quot;I am Violet van Hook,&quot; she informed him. &quot;You remember me, no doubt, in connection with the robbery in our Riverdale home two years ago.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, indeed!&quot; Glidden pricked up his ears. &quot;Very well. Miss van Hook, I assure you. Not been robbed again, have you?&quot;\n\n&quot;No. I am thankful to say! But I have information for you, very valuable information. Will you call at my Fifth Avenue home as soon as possible?&quot;\n\n&quot;Within half an hour.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thank you. By the way — &quot;\n\n&quot;Well?&quot;\n\n&quot;I think you had better wear a disguise.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very good. I will do so.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nI Saw That Man This Morning\n\nMiss van Hook received him in the library, half an hour later.\n\nShe then looked more pale and serious, and, after a conventional greeting, she said gravely:\n\n&quot;My parents are in Washington, Mr. Glidden, or I would have conferred with them before sending for you. I have not forgotten that the robber who imposed upon us .so outrageously as Lord Arkright, presenting forged letters bearing the names of mv father&#39;s London bankers, returned to me a very valuable and dearly cherished necklace of sapphires and diamonds. In spite of my gratitude tor that magnanimity and consideration, my conscience will not let me hide what I have learned.&quot;\n\n&quot;I see.&quot; Glidden gazed at her inquiringly. &quot;What have you learned, may I ask?&quot;\n\n&quot;I saw that man this morning.&quot;\n\n&quot;The robber?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot;\n\n&quot;How long ago, and where?&quot;\n\n&quot;About an hour ago. I was making a deposit with the Stability Trust Company.&quot;\n\n&quot;Are you sure of his identity?&quot;\n\n&quot;No, not positively sure,&quot; Violet admitted. &quot;I would not have recognized him at all. Mr. Glidden, but for one fact: Lord Arkright, so called, wore a bloodstone ring, to one curious feature of which he once called my attention. The blood-red spots in the stone formed the outline of a bird, he told me he called it his — Red Raven.&quot;\n\n&quot;Red Raven — I guess that&#39;s right.&quot; Glidden&#39;s eyes were aglow with subdued elation. &quot;That man. Miss van Hook, is the chief of the worst gang of crooks in this country. The Order of Red Ravens — that&#39;s what it&#39;s called. Did the man you saw this morning wear a ring like Lord Arkright&#39;s?&quot;\n\n&quot;Exactly like it,&quot; said Violet. &quot;I saw it plainly while he was writing a check. I instantly recalled it, and then I studied the man himself. In a general way, I mean his figure, and such features as cannot be disguised, he was precisely like Lord Arkright.&quot;\n\n&quot;Did he see you?&quot;\n\n&quot;No. sir.&quot;\n\n&quot;Or know that you saw him?&#39;\n\n&quot;He did not. He cashed his check, and then left the bank.&quot;\n\n&quot;He must be one of the depositors, then.&quot;\n\n&quot;I know that he is.&quot; said Violet. &quot;I questioned the receiving teller, Mr. Raymond, who said that the man is a personal friend of his.&quot;\n\n&quot;Questioned him. eh? His personal friend, eh?&quot; Glidden&#39;s grizzled brows fell perceptibly. &quot;It may have been better if you had not questioned him. What did you ask the teller?&quot;\n\n&quot;Only who the man was.&quot;\n\n&quot;Nothing more?&quot;\n\n&quot;That was all. Mr. Raymond said that his name is Hamilton Fisk, and that he lives in the Hotel Waldron. That is all that was said about him. I decided that I had better not ask too many questions before stating the facts to you.&quot;\n\n&quot;I see.&quot; Glidden chuckled approvingly — a chuckle from Glidden was most extraordinary. &quot;You did right. Miss van Hook, perfectly right. You are wiser than most women. Really, I am quite proud of you. Not another word about this, however, until after I have looked into it. Not one word, mind you!&quot;\n\nMiss van Hook assured him to that effect, and Detective Glidden thanked her, and departed. He looked more grim and threatening while he hastened down Fifth Avenue. His elation gave way to an ugly aggressiveness that few would have wished to arouse, much less oppose.\n\n&quot;Is she right? Is there anything in it?&quot; he asked himself. &quot;Have I finally got him, this thieving Red Raven chieftain. this slick and slippery rascal, who repeatedly has slipped through my fingers and given me the laugh? Have I finally got him? Hamilton Fisk, eh? It would be like him, by thunder, to be dwelling with the select, and posing as a blueblood. I&#39;ll soon find out. I&#39;ll mighty soon find out.&quot;\n\nGlidden did not, however, let his eagerness pitch him over the traces. He hastened in disguise to the Hotel Waldron, where he cornered the manager, with whom he was very well acquainted, in his private office.\n\n&quot;I want a little information, Sheldon,&quot; he said, after revealing his identity. &quot;But mum&#39;s the word! Don&#39;t you by hint, look, or sign reveal what passes between us. You know what that means. You know what it means, Sheldon, coming from me.&quot;\n\nSheldon smiled and bowed.\n\n&quot;You have said enough, Glidden, along that line,&quot; he replied. &quot;I&#39;ll forget that you have been here. What do you want to know?&quot;\n\n&quot;All you can tell me about Hamilton Fisk.&quot;\n\n&#39;&#39;That will be all to the good,&quot; said Sheldon. &quot;He has been one of my guests for three years. He is a thoroughbred gentleman, a bachelor, a man of means, and a mighty fine fellow.&quot;\n\n&quot;Any business?&quot;\n\n&quot;None, beyond an occasional venture in stocks. Fisk don&#39;t need a business. He has money enough. He employs a valet, and lives like a gentleman. And that&#39;s what he is, too, Glidden, you can bank on that.&quot;\n\n&quot;Do you know where he came from, or any more about him?&quot;\n\n&quot;Only along the same lines.&quot;\n\n&quot;Are his habits good?&quot;\n\n&quot;Exemplary. For a man residing in New York, he really leads the simple life. I don&#39;t know why you ask these questions, nor care. Take it from me, however, you&#39;ll not get anything on Hamilton Fisk. He could have my bank roll for the asking.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s all, then.&quot; Glidden arose abruptly. &quot;Forget it!&quot;\n\n&quot;I have pledged myself to that effect.&quot;\n\nIt was not quite all, however, for Glidden lingered in the hotel office until he got a look at the suspected man. But he could detect no convincing resemblance to the crook he repeatedly had encountered, yet who had not looked twice alike; and he then left the Hotel Waldron, with his ardor somewhat chilled — while Mr. Richard Ravenswood, entirely unconscious of this ominous interest in him, was sauntering into the dining room to lunch.\n\nDetective Glidden did not drop the matter. Not for a moment did he contemplate doing so. He returned to headquarters, where he cornered and confided in Jack Armstrong, his invariable choice as an assistant in serious cases.\n\n&quot;By Jove, the girl may be right!&quot; said Armstrong hopefully. &quot;She saw more of that rascal than we ever saw, all put together. Nevertheless, Joe, it seems too good to he true. How can we cinch it? Would a grilling — &quot;\n\n&quot;Grilling be hanged!&quot; Glidden blurted. &quot;That gink, if he&#39;s the man, would end with grilling us. He&#39;s much too slick to have left himself open. What have we ever found that would serve to identify him? Never a finger print; never so much as a hair that we could prove came from his own head.&quot;\n\n&quot;There&#39;s no denying that, Joe.&quot;\n\n&quot;He&#39;s the limit, Armstrong,&quot; Glidden continued, snarling. &quot;He can&#39;t be downed with a bluff. He has put it all over people at the Waldron, if this Fisk is the man, and he stands ace-high in all quarters. No crimes have been committed in the Waldron. He&#39;s too slick to have brought us buzzing so near his ears. He knows enough to have got in his work outside. No, no. Jack, there wouldn&#39;t be anything in a grilling. There&#39;s only one way to corner that rat and beat out his devilish brains.&quot;\n\n&quot;What way is that?&quot;\n\n&quot;Watch him!&quot; snapped Glidden. &quot;Keep him in the dark, and watch him. Watch that infernal valet, too, who may be more a pal than a servant.&quot;\n\n&quot;As like as not, Joe.&quot;\n\n&quot;Here&#39;s another point.&quot; Glidden added. &quot;It&#39;s several months since these red rascals got in their work. They have been fattening on birds and bottles, no doubt, from the fruits of that Newport job. But that must be nearly blown in by this time.&quot;\n\n&quot;Surely.&quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s money to marbles, then, that they have another job shaped up by this time. An espionage will not be of long duration. Now is the time to get them red-handed. Armstrong, if Violet van Hook is right. We then will have got them, by thunder, only with the help of a woman, a veritable fluke, as far as we are concerned.&quot;\n\nArmstrong laughed, but Glidden was in no laughing mood. Repeated failures in his relentless pursuit of Ravenswood had nettled him to his depths.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s what we&#39;ll do,&quot; he said bluntly. &quot;We&#39;ll begin a systematic espionage. You watch the valet. Ill look after the master, this Fisk, or whatever his name really is. I&#39;ll find out. You can bet that I&#39;ll find out, Armstrong, sooner or later! We&#39;ll begin our work at once.&quot;\n\nAll this occurred on a Thursday.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Devil Himself\n\nStill oblivious to the threatening interest he had aroused, Mr. Richard Ravenswood entered the quarters of the Stability Trust Company at precisely noon the following Saturday, the hour for closing business for the week. He carried a strong leather satchel of medium size in one hand, and approached the window of the receiving teller.\n\nA bearded man followed him in from the street, and from the corridor cautiously watched him through the oval glass in one of the swinging doors — Detective Glidden.\n\n&quot;Ah, Fisk, how are you?&quot; Raymond gazed out and greeted him cordially. &quot;Glad to see you. You are some stranger.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ditto.&quot; Ravenswood laughed. It was their first meeting since Thursday. &quot;You know where I hang out. Why haven&#39;t you called?&quot;\n\n&quot;Very busy. I may drop round this evening.&quot;\n\n&quot;Do so. We&#39;ll knock out a few games of billiards. I enjoy playing with you, Raymond. I would be a greater stranger, however, bar calling to ask a favor of you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Consider it granted.&quot; Raymond said quickly. &quot;What can I do for you?&quot;\n\n&quot;I have just converted some securities into Pacific bonds.&quot; Ravenswood held up the satchel. &quot;There was a delay in delivering them, and I have not time to go to the deposit vault to put them in my drawer before closing. Short day this, you know. I wish you would set the satchel in your vault over Sunday. It will be safer than at the Waldron.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why, certainly,&quot; Raymond exclaimed, opening his lattice window to receive it. &quot;Very glad to do so for you. It is locked, of course?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes. If you wish to inspect its contents, however, I will — &quot;\n\n&quot;Nonsense! Don&#39;t reach for the key. I will place it in our bond drawer. By the way, though, you cannot get it before ten o&#39;clock Monday morning. Our vault will be closed in a few minutes, and the time lock is set for ten on Monday. The devil himself could not open it before then.&quot;\n\n&quot;That will suit me admirably.&quot; Ravenswood smiled and nodded. &quot;I intend turning part of them into Steel, if the market opens weak on Monday. I will he here at ten o&#39;clock.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good enough! That settles it.&quot;\n\nRaymond hastened to place the satchel in the vault.\n\nGlidden did not see the transaction. He was sauntering to and fro in the corridor. It was indiscreet to peer constantly through the swinging door.\n\nRavenswood lingered, saw the clerks and tellers hurriedly place their books and funds in the vault, saw the massive doors closed and locked, impregnably closed until Monday, and then he added to the conversation he had been carrying on with Raymond:\n\n&#39;&#39;How soon will you be at liberty? Will you go with me to lunch?&quot;\n\n&quot;Delighted!&quot; Raymond nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll be through here in about five minutes.&quot;\n\n&quot;Capital! I&#39;ll wait for you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, by the way!&quot; Raymond, suddenly remembering, gazed out, laughing. &quot;I think you might win out, Fisk, if so inclined; a very wealthy, attractive, and desirable young lady. A fine chance for matrimony, Fisk, on the level.&quot;\n\n&quot;Excuse me!&quot; Ravenswood laughed, and shook his head. &quot;One half of that word is enough for me. Money, not matrimony.&quot;\n\n&quot;You ought to be taxed, and may be, if the present administration is continued.&quot;\n\n&quot;Let it come. Bachelorhood is worth it.&quot;\n\n&quot;She&#39;s a beautiful girl, nevertheless. You must have made an impression on her, too, for she had enough interest in you to inquire about you.&quot;\n\n&quot;When, and of whom?&quot;\n\n&quot;When you were here Thursday morning. She saw you write and cash a check. When handing me her deposit, after you went out, she asked me about you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very nice of her, I&#39;m sure.&quot; Ravenswood smiled. &quot;I feel highly flattered. Who is the young lady?&quot;\n\n&quot;Her name is Violet van Hook.&quot; Ravenswood heard it, without a change of countenance. An involuntary chill ran down his spine, however, and his nerves began to tingle.\n\n&quot;Van Hook — I do not place her,&quot; he said calmly. &quot;Nor can I conceive why she felt an interest in me.&quot;\n\n&quot;She said you reminded her of a friend who lives in Denver.&quot;\n\n&quot;H&#39;m, is that so?&quot; Ravenswood knew it to have been an equivocation, and that he must have been recognized. &quot;Thursday morning, eh? Two days ago. You told Miss van Hook all about me, of course?&quot;\n\n&quot;No, indeed!&quot; Raymond shook his head. &quot;She ended her inquiries very abruptly.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ah! Very abruptly, eh?&quot; The significance of it was doubly convincing.\n\n&quot;I told her only your name and where you resided.&quot;\n\n&quot;That was quite enough to tell her.&quot; Ravenswood laughed lightly, but his voice was tinged with subtle irony. &quot;All ready, Raymond, are you?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes. I&#39;ll be with you in half a minute.&quot;\n\nRavenswood sauntered toward the corridor door. He appeared as calm and complacent as when lie entered. There was no sign of perturbation, no indication of threatening misgivings. He passed out with Raymond, and went with him to lunch in a popular restaurant, more genial and jovial than usual, if anything; and they parted after the meal.\n\nRavenswood sauntered up the street until he came to a drug store in which he saw a pay-station telephone booth, the door of which faced the street. He entered it and removed the receiver — but held down the bracket with his finger.\n\nHe then pretended to drop a coin in the slot and to communicate with some one — but all the while, with his hack toward the street door and the store windows, he was gazing intently at the polished nickel ring around the mouthpiece.\n\nPresently, replacing the receiver, he tore a leaf from his notebook and wrote on it with a lead pencil. He then folded the leaf and placed it, with obvious care, in the middle of the telephone book, leaving it there.\n\nGlidden saw him do it, furtively watching him through one of the windows. but he quickly moved away when his quarry turned to leave the booth.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s up to something, the rat!&quot; he snarled, under his breath. &quot;Why did he telephone, and to whom: Has Raymond told him about the girl? That&#39;s not likely, or be would have betrayed. What did he write and leave in that book? I have it, by thunder! He has planned with some one, probably one of his rascally red-bird confederates, to go there for written instructions, or a communication of some kind. I can nail it. by Jove! and pick him up again before he turns the corner.&quot;\n\nRavenswood then was sauntering slowly up the street.\n\nGlidden entered the drug store, and hurried into the telephone booth. Seizing the exchange book, he rapidly turned the leaves, and found the folded scrap of paper. He opened it, and read a single mocking, staggering line:\n\nGlidden, you&#39;re a chump!\n\nThe significance of it was unmistakable and irresistible. Glidden vented a fierce oath, then turned like an angry bull and rushed out to the street.\n\nRavenswood had disappeared.\n\nIt was eight o&#39;clock that evening when Glidden and Armstrong met at headquarters and sat down to compare notes, the former immediately stating what had occurred.\n\n&quot;A ruse; one of his rat tricks to give me the slip and the laugh — that&#39;s what it was!&quot; he snarled bitterly. &quot;The teller told him about the girl. I didn&#39;t believe he would even remember it. But it put the rascal wise, he reasoned that the girl would inform me, that she must already have done so, and the fact that I have not approached him and openly called him down led him to suspect that he was being shadowed. He clinched it in the telephone booth.\n\n&quot;I know, now, curse him! The nickel ring around the mouthpiece reflected the stone door and windows. Though his back was turned that way, it enabled him to see me looking in, and my disguise did not fool him. He left that scurvy scrap of paper, knowing I would rush in to get it. enabling him to bolt and vanish. Vanish be hanged! I&#39;ll not sleep nights till I get him!&quot;\n\n&quot;Have you been to the Waldron — &quot;\n\n&quot;Waldron — why go there?&quot; Glidden ground his teeth disgustedly. &quot;He&#39;ll never set foot in the Waldron again. Let him alone to be too wise for that. But I&#39;ll find him. Armstrong, if he stays above ground. I&#39;ll get him, and bury him, blast him! I&#39;ll can him for keeps! What about the valet, Nolan? We might nail him.&quot;\n\nArmstrong shrugged his shoulders expressively.\n\n&quot;Too late!&quot; he said tersely.\n\n&quot;What do you mean?&quot; snapped Glidden.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll tell you, Joe. when your jaw slows down. That&#39;s your only safety valve. You&#39;d explode, bang! burst all to smithereens, if you didn&#39;t cut loose with your tongue and let off steam. Nolan left the Waldron at precisely noon. He appeared for the first time to have a definite mission. I shadowed him to Z Street, and there I lost him.&quot;\n\n&quot;Losing seems to be our long suit. How the devil did you lose him?&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s the strange part of it.&quot; Armstrong said more seriously, &quot;he entered one of the low brick buildings in that section. It is rented by the agent of a New Orleans sugar and molasses firm, a man named Hawley. I&#39;ll swear that Nolan went in there, and I entered scarce ten seconds after him, thinking I might overhear something, and would make a few inquiries to cover my intrusion.&quot;\n\n&quot;I see.&quot;\n\n&quot;There is a front office, a space partly filled with barrels and casks, and a back room, the door of which was open. But there is no rear door, nor any stairway to the second floor. That is reached by a door outside, and Hawley lives up there. He&#39;s the only tenant in the building.&quot;\n\n&quot;I get you,&quot; Glidden growled. &quot;But what about Nolan?&quot;\n\n&quot;Nolan wasn&#39;t there.&quot;\n\n&quot;Not there?&#39;\n\n&quot;Not hide nor hair of him.&quot;\n\n&quot;Humph!&quot; Glidden&#39;s furrowed brows contracted until they mingled.\n\n&quot;I wandered around and looked everywhere, while talking about the price of molasses with Hawley — but there was no Nolan.&quot;\n\n&quot;He may have gone down cellar.&quot;\n\n&quot;I could see no door leading to a cellar.&quot;\n\n&quot;He could not have evaporated!&quot; snapped Glidden. &quot;He must have been somewhere in the place. Where is this building? What part of Z Street?&quot;\n\n&quot;That section in which old buildings are rapidly being torn down for larger ones. This one, now that I think of it, is directly back of the Stability Trust Building. It is — What now?&quot;\n\nGlidden&#39;s grim face had changed like a flash, while his fist banged a table as if to splinter it.\n\n&quot;By Heaven, I have it!&quot; he cried, eyes blazing. &quot;There&#39;s a job on that bank. That&#39;s why he&#39;s a depositor. That&#39;s why he&#39;s friendly with Raymond. That&#39;s what became of the satchel. I wondered — but I don&#39;t wonder, now! It&#39;s in the bank vault, Armstrong, loaded with dynamite, or the devil knows what.&quot;\n\n&quot;You mean — &quot;\n\n&quot;I mean that we&#39;ve got them.&quot; Glidden rose up with a terrible laugh. &quot;We have them nipped, Jack, every damned thieving Red Raven. I&#39;ll clip their wings this time, by thunder! Get a bunch of the boys together. Make it a score, with a gun in every pocket. We&#39;ve got them. By Heaven, I&#39;ll not leave a live red bird among them!&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Flock\n\nThey had gathered like blackbirds, singly and from diverse directions, until the flock was complete. They had come at intervals during the day, from various quarters and with unostentatious stealth, seeking cover through different avenues, an alley and an outer bulkhead door, a trap in the back room, witness Nolan, and some like moles in the earth, through tunnels secretly constructed during months of labor, while the refuse of dirt and stones was removed in casks and barrels marked — molasses and sugar.\n\nRavenswood looked strangely serious while he viewed them at close upon nine o&#39;clock that evening, his brood of Red Ravens, gathered in an underground room between the low brick building mentioned by Armstrong and the rear foundation wall of the Stability Trust.\n\nThrough a broad opening from this room, one of three leading in different directions, it could be seen that part of the wall was gone, that a circular chamber had been formed, that timbers and cement and steel had been broken from the ceiling, leaving only a comparatively thin and feeble partition between this circular chamber and — the interior of the bank vault.\n\nRavenswood gazed from one to another in the bright electric light — stolen by means of a concealed wire from the service in the trust building. He had entered only a few minutes before, and had found them all there, awaiting him, intent upon the near culmination of the most elaborate and laborious crime they had ever undertaken,\n\nRavenswood checked their conversation, and addressed them more seriously than usual, and not without a tinge of affection in his low, sonorous voice.\n\n&quot;Attention, Red Ravens!&quot; he began. &quot;I have important disclosures to make, and little time in which to make them. It is twenty minutes to nine, when we shall learn with what success we have labored. We have met here many times in the past six months, and this is to be the last time here — and perhaps our last meeting as an organized band of underworld workers.&quot;\n\n&quot;Last meeting?&quot; Nolan stared at him amazedly, while the jaws of others fell.\n\n&quot;Our last meeting, Dickie?&quot; Ravenswood bowed.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s a long lane, lads, that has no turning,&quot; said he. &quot;Sooner or later, despite the utmost precautions that can be taken, the pitcher that goes to the well may be broken. After to-night, Red Ravens, we shall disband temporarily, at least, and whether a subsequent reorganization will be feasible will depend upon many contingencies.&quot;\n\n&quot;Great guns!&quot; This from Galen. &quot;What&#39;s the trouble, Dickie?&quot;\n\n&quot;Glidden is in a way to make good.&quot;\n\n&quot;Make good!&quot; Nolan gasped.\n\n&quot;What do you mean, Dickie?&quot;\n\n&quot;He has identified me as Fisk, for three years a respected resident in the fashionable Waldron. But the Waldron, Faddy, will see no more of us.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thunderatioa!&quot; Nolan scarce could believe his ears. &quot;How did tire infernal dick get wise?&quot;\n\n&quot;Through my identification by a former victim — the Van Hook girl. Naturally, of course, she hastened to inform Glidden, who investigated the Van Hook robbery.&quot;\n\n&quot;But when did that come off?&quot; Lacy demanded apprehensively. &quot;How long has Glidden known this?&quot;\n\n&quot;Since Thursday morning.&quot;\n\n&quot;The devil you say!&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be alarmed.&quot; Ravenswood said assuringly. &quot;He has been looking me up and making inquiries, no doubt, but he has not approached me openly.&quot;\n\n&quot;You may have been shadowed.&quot;\n\n&quot;I know that I have been watched. Fortunately, however, this is my first visit here since Wednesday. I discovered this afternoon that Glidden was trailing me, but I shook him off by — well, I&#39;ll take time to tell you all about it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thundering guns! This is awful, Dickie,&quot; Nolan said, with a groan, after Ravenswood had concluded. &quot;If we could only silence the infernal — &quot;\n\nRavenswood checked him with a gesture.\n\n&quot;It is too late for anything of that kind,&quot; he said more brusquely. &quot;The milk is spilled and the pitcher broken. Our only wise course is to disband temporarily, as I have said, with a possibility of subsequent reorganization. I must have time in which to consider it. in which to plan to meet the new conditions, if it seems judicious.&quot;\n\n&quot;You may be right, Dickie,&quot; Nolan soberly admitted.\n\n&quot;I know I am right.&quot; Ravenswood spoke decidedly. &quot;After to-night, therefore, it will be each man for himself, each still loyal to the ties that have joined us, to the pledges that so long have held us together. That is all I have to say. Brother Ravens, along those lines.&quot;\n\nHis ten confederates, including, with those mentioned, Finley and Blake, Drogan, Hawley, Midget Maloney, and two others, looked grave and regretful upon hearing these announcements; but none ventured to advise or oppose this man, who long had been their successful chief, guide, and director. Low growls and threats against Glidden came from several, however, which Ravenswood immediately checked.\n\n&quot;There is nothing in that,&quot; he said curtly. &quot;We have held the pole for a long time, and later may regain it. Let&#39;s take things as they come. Fortunately, these discoveries were not made until nearly the very moment when our biggest job was done. That now must engage us. That moment is close at hand. We have only six minutes to wait. Screen that opening under the vault, some of you, lest the debris is scattered by the explosion.&quot;\n\nThree of the men sprang up and placed a broad wooden screen across the opening, bracing it in place with a strip of joist. All were alert, then, and eager for the end of their knavish undertaking.\n\n&quot;You got the satchel into the vault, all right, Dickie?&quot; Nolan questioned.\n\n&quot;Easily,&quot; Ravenswood nodded. &quot;Raymond complied without an objection.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good for Raymond!&quot;\n\n&quot;It strikes me that we are lame in one way,&quot; Lacy ventured.\n\n&quot;In what way, Lacy?&quot;\n\n&quot;In setting the machine that ignites the explosive so early as nine o&#39;clock. Wouldn&#39;t midnight have been better?&quot;\n\n&quot;Far from it!&quot; Ravenswood quickly shook his head. &quot;There is considerable noise in the streets at nine o&#39;clock, while they are comparatively quiet at midnight. The explosion then would be more likely to be heard.&quot;\n\n&quot;There is no great danger of that at either time,&quot; put in Nolan. &quot;It will be confined to the vault, bar what sound comes down here. We&#39;ll get that, all right, good and strong. Dynamite works downward, you know.&quot;\n\n&quot;I know that, of course,&quot; Lacy growled.\n\n&quot;It won&#39;t leave enough of the vault floor to swear by,&quot; Nolan added. &quot;We know that the time-lock doors cannot be opened, and even if the watchman in the building were to bear the muffled sound, before he can locate it and make an investigation, we&#39;ll have looted the vault and be making a get-away.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s how we&#39;ve figured it, sure,&quot; Galen nodded.\n\n&quot;By the way, Dickie.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, Paddy?&quot;\n\n&quot;Is there any possibility that Glidden picked you up again and shadowed you here?&quot;\n\n&quot;Not the slightest, Paddy,&quot; Ravenswood said confidently — but he overlooked that a spy might have been watching the movements of his supposed valet.\n\n&quot;There would be the devil to pay, Dickie, in that case,&quot; Nolan vouchsafed grimly.\n\n&quot;Very true — in that case,&quot; Ravenswood allowed, glancing at his watch.\n\nHe appeared perfectly calm and cool, but others were nervous and apprehensive, some crouching in the entrance to the tunnels and others against the rough walls, all awaiting the expected explosion.\n\nIt then lacked only two minutes to nine.\n\nIt was true, indeed, much more true than any Red Raven even remotely suspected. For Joe Glidden, not in the harness thirty years for nothing, had a happy faculty for putting two and two together, and he no sooner had heard Armstrong&#39;s story, combining his discoveries with his own, than this experienced, keen-sighted, persistent, and relentless Glidden hit upon — the truth.\n\nOne minute to nine.\n\nDark figures then had stolen into Z Street, more than a score of them, all trained detectives from headquarters, each with guns, and ready to kill, if necessary — they were stealing in and around the low brick building, covering every discoverable avenue of escape within half a block, while others were watching the bank in front and invading the building with a trusty janitor.\n\nNine o&#39;clock.\n\nRavens wood had not stirred.\n\nTen seconds passed.\n\n&quot;Suppose the machine fails, Dickie?&quot; Nolan&#39;s eyes were bright and dilated, but he was very pale.\n\nRavenswood gazed at him a bit fondly.\n\n&quot;It will not fail, Paddy,&quot; he said calmly. &quot;It will — &quot;\n\nNo. it did not fail. The expected explosion drowned the words on the lips of the Red Raven chief.\n\nThe muffled thunder of it shook the earth and walls around them. The wooden screen was blown half across the underground room. Great slabs of stone and cement fell to the floor of the circular chamber. A vast volume of smoke poured downward, filling every opening and corner. Through the blackness of it, the lights glowed wan and yellow, and the moving figures of the excited men were like apparitions seen in a mist.\n\nMingled with the terrific noise, unheard because of it, came the crash of breaking doors, the smash of a bulkhead, the fall of a trap, the furious rush of heavy feet down stairway and steps.\n\nNolan was the first to see them, the inpouring intruders, white-faced and fierce-eyed, and with ready weapons, he uttered a yell that rose above every other sound, seizing Ravenswood by the arm and dragging him into the nearest tunnel.\n\n&quot;The dicks! They&#39;re on us!&quot; Nolan shrieked. &quot;Every man for himself!&quot;\n\nGlidden&#39;s roar was mingled with it:\n\n&quot;Hands up! We&#39;ll shoot to kill!&quot;\n\nIt brought a defiant shot from Lacy, sending a bullet through Glidden&#39;s arm, and then came the volley.\n\nLacy, Galen, and Midget Mahoney went down, all badly wounded. Hawley, Drogan, and Finley were beaten off their feet before they could draw a weapon. Overwhelming numbers were overcoming the Red Ravens.\n\nThe feet of two, however, were moving like those of frightened hares. They sped through the tunnel, emerged from the back door of a lodging house within thirty seconds, saw that the way around a stable was open — and then they were off and away through the misty night.\n\n&quot;Cripes!&quot; gasped Nolan. &quot;Our first slip-up, Dickie.&quot;\n\n&quot;Never mind the slip-up, Paddy.&quot; Ravenswood&#39;s voice was calm, but through the black smoke that seared his face his features were painfully drawn and ghastly white. &quot;It&#39;s the boys — the boys. Paddy! Heaven help them! Some are down and out — down and out forever!&quot;\n\n&quot;True. Dickie, too true! Glidden, curse the dick, has made good this time. What — &quot;\n\n&quot;Come on, and don&#39;t question,&quot; Ravenswood interrupted. &quot;We are down to doubles and cases, Paddy. We&#39;ll run double. Paddy, you and I, for the present — but Heaven knows where!&quot;\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll get there, Dickie.&quot; Nolan&#39;s voice took on a more cheerful ring. &quot;We&#39;ll get there, all right, dear old Dickie.&quot;\n\nRavenswood grasped his arm with a viselike grip.\n\n&quot;You bet we&#39;ll get there!&quot; he cried, through his set teeth. &quot;The end is not not yet, Paddy, not yet — not yet!&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n"

And he was a smart monkey. He had cased this job himself personal. Had cooked up the scheme for pulling it off. Had spent a good two weeks laying the groundwork. Nobody yet had ever called Big Sid Cloras a dummy either. Yet here he was locked up in their tin-can of a jail, as good as a dead duck. He couldn&#39;t understand it.\n\nIt couldn&#39;t be. Not for him, Big Sid. Yet the bars of that cell door were chrome steel, not paper-mâché. And those birds chatting down the hall were local coppers with a couple of men from the County Homicide Squad. And an escort of State Troopers were en route to take him over to the real clink at the county seat. It couldn&#39;t happen to him, Big Sid. But it had. And it was going to be for murder, maybe.\n\n&quot;Sid … Sid,&quot; said Johnny the Itch almost reverently. He always addressed Big Sid that way. He said, &quot;Sid, I think maybe I got something figured. But — but how did it happen, Sid?&quot;\n\n&quot;Aw, shut up,&quot; said Big Sid with a disgusted glance over his thick shoulder. He didn&#39;t bother really looking at him. Nobody much ever had bothered looking at Johnny the Itch. He was one of those little insignificant hangdog things with vacant eyes. Round-shouldered. The kind they turn off the assembly line to hold up the fronts of pool parlors. He had that twitching muscle in his right cheek. It made the skin jerk and pull as if he were trying to get rid of an itch without using his hand. He could do one thing. He could tool a heap like a maniacal genius born with a steering wheel in his hands.\n\n&quot;Shut up,&quot; Big Sid grunted his way again and walked past the bowl in the corner of the cell. He was trying to figure this out. He stood there winding the tail of his necktie around a big finger.\n\nJohnny the Itch pulled nervously at the wide-brimmed fedora jerked down on his bony skull. &quot;But, Sid, I think I got a way to —\n\nBig Sid turned around, spat out his cigaret, heeled it into the concrete. He didn&#39;t take his eyes off Johnny the Itch for a long moment. They were big muddy eyes, protruding. When Big Sid looked at you that way, a guy felt he was being measured for a casket. Big Sid could haul off and belt your teeth down your throat with those tremendous arms of his. And those eyes would never change.\n\nHe really wasn&#39;t a tall or unusually large man, Big Sid. But he was solid beef. That big belly that filled out a double-breasted drum-tight. The massive shoulders that started minus courtesy of neck from right beneath his double chin. The big, wide-nostrilled nose that gave him a certain kind of heavy dignity. He exuded bigness.\n\nJohnny the Itch fingered away sweat that rolled down from under his fedora and nodded obediently. He felt of the fedora gingerly as Big Sid turned away. Big Sid was thinking and had to be let alone. When Big Sid thought, it was real important. Later, he&#39;d tell him.\n\nBig Sid sweated and listened to the buzz of voices from down the corridor and tried not to believe he might have signed his own death warrant. He put his hands on his broad hips, ignoring the bandaged wrist where that copper&#39;s bullet had got him. He went back to the beginning.\n\nIt had been such a sweet set-up. This dinky little whistle-stop of a town. Duffyville. Over near the southwestern border of the state. With its single bank, the Duffyville National. And that motor parts plant on the outskirts with its heavy backlog of defense orders that had compelled a doubling of its help. A consequent raise in its payroll, too. And that payroll moved through the bank, naturally. Just a little matter of something over $21,000 each week.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s a shame to take it,&quot; he, Big Sid, had said in the beginning. Then he had cased it thoroughly. And he had moved into town, openly and aboveboard. Registered at the little hotel as one &quot;Samuel Norris.&quot; Big front with plenty of credentials and a neat black mustache which could be shaved off easily enough later. Then he had walked right into that bank and identified himself. Even opened up a small checking account.\n\n&quot;Just for ready cash, of course.&quot;\n\nThat was the way he did things. Cool and nervy. Always thinking, thinking ahead. &#39;He was a smart guy. Sure maybe you could grab that dough by blasting your way with the heaters plenty. But that kind of stuff only made you hot as hell, afterward. You had to keep lamming and maybe you never got a chance to enjoy it. Big Sid wasn&#39;t dumb like that.\n\nHis way, it had been a cinch to get the whole layout. How the payroll cash was brought from up the line in an armored car to the bank before opening time in the morning. And the company guards came down and picked it up immediately after lunch for their auditing department. After lunch!\n\nHe had put his finger on that weak spot almost from the start. The quiet lunch-hour in a sleepy little town. When two of the tellers and the bank officers went home to eat the way they did in those hick burgs. That was the time for the snatch.\n\nAnd even that was not to be done crudely. Not Big Sid&#39;s way. He was pretty well known in the Duffyville National by then. Been dropping in to confer with the vice-president about the local real estate situation. It was so simple. A few hints dropped about the possible establishment of a new branch plant … of course, a man wasn&#39;t always free to mention in advance whom he represented. And they&#39;d have to get definite word about the extension of a railroad siding for the lading purposes, too.\n\nOh, it went over big. He knew how they did things in that bank. And he made them feel they knew him. Which was very important. Especially that teller down at the end window, Eckland. The one who stayed when the others went out to eat at the noon hour. Eckland was sort of good looking in a weak blond way. He studied accounting at night. &quot;Samuel Norris&quot; said he might know of an opening for a bright young fellow there. When he came up to the city, they&#39;d have to get together. Least he could do would be to show him around the hot spots some night. That always made Eckland flush some; you could see he was the type who dreamed of himself as a glamor boy, a killer-diller with the dames.\n\nAnd there was that fallen-arched Paddy who was the guard. Nice and simple. An occasional cigar, a friendly slap on the back, did for him.\n\nSo there she was. Perfect. The clincher was to get away without firing a shot. Before there was a warning. No shooting and they would be miles away before they stopped rubbing their eyes in that one water-tank burg. Probably wouldn&#39;t have figured out exactly what had happened until some time Saturday. The payroll came in on Friday.\n\nThey scoured every main artery and side road and cart track for miles in every direction, he and Johnny the Itch. They figured on cutoffs in case of a chase and how they could double in their tracks. And the pass over the mountain ridge that would take them across the state line. And about forty miles down the line, on that abandoned farm, they located the old barn where they would switch cars. They would hide the second heap in the barn. Williams would take care of that. He as the trigger man. Sonny Williams, cool as ice behind the business end of a Tommy gun.\n\nNow, Sonny Williams was —\n\n&quot;Sid,&quot; Johnny the Itch said, watching the cell door nervously. He couldn&#39;t keep the whimper out of his voice now. &quot;Sid, time&#39;s getting short. I — I think I got a way, a chance for us anyways. I got something — &quot;        His whisper cracked and he made a faint gesture toward his fedora as if he feared the walls had eyes as well as ears.\n\nHe was scared as hell. It made Big Sid sick. The little rat didn&#39;t have anything to be scared about. Not like he did. He glared at him.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m thinking,&quot; he warned heavily.\n\nJohnny the Itch nodded so his under jaw jiggled. When a phone jangled down the corridor, his eyes bugged right at the door. Then he couldn&#39;t stand it any longer.\n\n&quot;Look, Sid, how did it happen? You&#39;re smart. You figured it all out and — &quot;\n\nHe half choked and had to dredge his voice up out of his throat again. He took his hat carefully by both hands.\n\n&quot;Look, Sid, I got — &quot;\n\nBig Sid took him by a bony shoulder and threw him. Back over the lower bunk of the cell. Johnny&#39;s head bounced off the wall. One of the town flatfoots came down and stared in, chewing gum methodically. He gave barely a glance to Johnny the Itch. The latter crouched there, frozen, hanging onto his hat as if it were a hunk of dynamite.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThis Is A Stick-Up, Stupid\n\nLighting a fresh cigaret, Big Sid paid no attention to the copper. He was thinking what to do. He pulled at a vest button and picked up the thread again. She had been all set. He had given the office to Sonny Williams. Williams had planted the second heap at the old barn and they had picked him up and rolled into Duffyville. Right on the nose. At 12.08 according to his wrist watch. Dropped off Williams on that residential street around the corner from the bank.\n\nSwung around the block. The timing was perfection. He, Big Sid, went up the bank steps as Williams came along less than ten yards away. Williams with that long bundle under his arm that looked like a florist&#39;s box. The sub-machine gun was in that box.\n\nA local tradesman was just leaving the bank, nodded to &quot;Mr. Norris.&quot; Then he, Big Sid, was over dropping his left hand on that guard&#39;s arm, asking affably for the vice-president. He had left for lunch, of course. And Sid slid the automatic from his side pocket and tucked it in the guard&#39;s side.\n\n&quot;This is a stick-up, stupid … .Keep your pants on an&#39; don&#39;t try to be a hero. Now, pass me through!&quot;\n\nThe guard&#39;s lips fell loosely away from his plates. He twisted his eyes over toward Williams. Williams was at a desk, the florist box lying in front of him, scribbling on a deposit slip. But Williams knew what was going on. The guard nodded his head on the fear-stiffened hinge of his neck and looked down at Eckland in the far cage, the only teller on now. The guard pointed toward the electrically controlled door in the teller cage partition that cut off the offices and vault from the customers&#39; side.\n\nEckland was looking down, smiling at &quot;Mr. Norris.&quot; Eckland nodded. He pressed a button in his cage. The door down the line clicked. And he, Big Sid, was through, inside. It went smooth as grease.\n\nWilliams was over, the Tommy gun out. Had herded the guard into a corner where he was hidden from the teller as well as any passersby. Behind the partition, he, Big Sid, wasted only a single glance at the open vault. That would have been the stupid move. He was too smart for that. He moved swiftly down behind the empty cages toward Eckland&#39;s, walking on his toes. His left foot hit a discarded paper bill binder and it crackled and he pulled away from it so he struck one of those adding machines on a portable carriage. It jolted and rattled loudly. But Eckland did not look around.\n\nThen he was right behind him. Had the automatic snout poking through the steel grille of the rear of the cage. Square at Eckland&#39;s back. Smack at the belt of his pinchback coat.\n\n&quot;This is a stick-up, Eckland,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Don&#39;t try to be a hero — or I&#39;ll blow you outa your shoes!&quot;\n\nThere was no sign from Eckland. He stood motionless, writing hand poised over a voucher.\n\n&quot;Now you&#39;re showing sense,&quot; he congratulated Eckland. &quot;Now back up easy and unhook this — &quot;\n\nThere was a low whistle. That would be Williams. It meant a depositor had come in. Williams had moved around to cover him with the Tommy gun. And that meant Eckland could see him and the gun now. Eckland&#39;s jaw unhinged and the pencil slid from his limp hand and fell to the floor. He peered forward, making gagging sounds.\n\n&quot;I told you this was a stick-up!&quot; Big Sid, told him, speaking louder now. &quot;I got a gun on your back! Make a move for that alarm and I&#39;ll give it to you! I&#39;m not fooling, Eckland!&quot;\n\nThere was a long second ticking off into eternity. That Eckland almost acted as if he didn&#39;t hear. His head never even started to twitch toward the rear. One of his hands clawed at the counter in front of him. Then he was moving. His right leg. Shakily but purposefully. Toward that pedal that sounded the hold-up alarm, flashing it right to local police headquarters.\n\n&quot;Eckland, I&#39;ll kill — &quot; But Eckland&#39;s foot never halted. And he, Big Sid, let him have it in the back. Twice point-blank.\n\nBut even as he tumbled, buckling forward in the middle, twisting with agony, Eckland&#39;s foot found the pedal, punched it. The damage was done. The bank resounded with the strident clamor of the gong. And Big Sid knew its twin was galvanizing them down at police headquarters.\n\nHe ran for it. Was moving even before the teller&#39;s slumping body hit the floor. Got through the partition door; he had even thought to block the snap-lock with a paper wad. Williams was out, going down the steps. The Tommy began to chatter. Then it was clattering down on the sidewalk, Williams crumpling over it with two slugs in his body. That cop coming out of the hardware store down the block happened to be a crack shot.\n\nHe, Big Sid, had sent him scurrying hack with one well-aimed slug though. Then headed for the car parked down beyond the &quot;No Parking&quot; zone directly in front of the bank. He always believed in keeping the law when nothing was to be gained in breaking it. He was smart that way.\n\nIt was the cop running from across the street who got him in the wrist and made him lose the automatic. A lucky shot. Still, he might have made it. He got the car between them. He was almost at it, lunging for that open front door on the curb side.\n\nJohnny the Itch was quaking in there behind the wheel, hands up at his ears, yapping, &quot;Cripes, I give up — I give up!&quot;\n\nBig Sid had always known how yellow Johnny was. That didn&#39;t bother him. He could take care of him when he got inside, got to that stubby .38 he had slipped into the glove compartment just in case. But he never got to it. That police car, roaring up from behind, siren a-scream, mashed into the tail end of their job. Jolted it ahead savagely. And with one foot on the running board, he was slammed to the ground hard, rolling his head against a tree. Then they had him. Him and Johnny the Itch. Only Johnny didn&#39;t count.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nYou Was Dumb, Syd\n\nBig Sid shook his head. He still couldn&#39;t figure how it had happened. It was crazy, that guy, Eckland, committing suicide like that. Something had gone wrong but —\n\nJohnny the Itch crept closer across the cell to Big Sid, shooting nervous glances toward the door. He admired Big Sid tremendously. Big Sid was so plenty smart, not a dumb cluck like him. He didn&#39;t blame Big Sid for what had happened. It couldn&#39;t be his fault; Big Sid never made a mistake. He could think.\n\nMaybe he had figured out what had gone wrong by now. He would ask him, then tell him what he had. It was dangerous to interrupt him when he was thinking. But time was growing short. And then when he knew, Big Sid would figure out a way to use it. Johnny put a hand to his jammed-down hat and spoke.\n\n&quot;Sid, you got it figured how we was double-crossed maybe? What slipped? I know you figured it right.&quot; His voice squeaked out of his throat. &quot;But — Sid, I got something you can figure on now, maybe. I got — &quot;\n\nBig Sid whirled on him, one of his heavy hands sweeping. He batted Johnny the Itch&#39;s fedora onto the side of his head. Johnny clutched at it as if it might be a life preserver.\n\nHe started: &quot;Sid, I got a — &quot;\n\nOne of the County Homicide men came to the cell door. He plucked the cold cigar from his mouth and nodded at Big Sid.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re lucky, pal. The hospital says Eckland the teller will pull through. If he hadn&#39;t, it would have been first degree and the hot squat for you.&quot;\n\nBig Sid sneered.\n\n&quot;Ah-h, that dumbhead, Eckland! He wanted to be a hero. He was asking for it!&quot; He spat disgustedly onto the floor. &quot;If he&#39;d had any sense, he wouldn&#39;t have gone for the alarm. I told him I had a gun in his back!&quot;\n\nThe Homicide man shook his head.\n\n&quot;He never heard you.&quot;\n\n&quot;But I was only two feet away! I told him twice an&#39; — &quot;\n\n&quot;Eckland was stone deaf, chum,&quot; the Homicide man said.\n\nBig Sid&#39;s lips curled. As if somebody had tried to tell him a fairy story.\n\n&quot;Why, I talked to that chump many a time! I — &quot;\n\nThe Homicide man agreed on that one. &quot;Yeah, facing him. So he could look -at you — and your lips. Eckland was a lip-reader. And — he was stone deaf, Cloras.&quot;\n\nBig Sid swayed. He might have pulled it off if that guy hadn&#39;t been deaf. Could have. He swore, raking his hair savagely.\n\n&quot;I never figured on that! I never figured — &#39;&#39;\n\n&quot;You — you never figured that?&quot; Johnny the Itch was on his feet when he screamed. His splinter of jaw jerked out fiercely. &quot;You — Big Sid — the smart guy! You never figured — you — you was dumb?&quot;\n\nBut he couldn&#39;t seem to believe it. Then — he did.\n\nHe jerked off his fedora, grabbing inside it. He came out with the stubby .38 from the glove compartment. He had been able to slip it out in the excitement after the capture. Nobody ever paid much attention to Johnny the Itch. Any more than they had thought to look under his hat when they searched him.\n\nHe said it again to Big Sid.\n\n&quot;You was dumb.&quot;\n\nThen he just kept triggering until the gun was emptied and he had put five slugs fatally into Big Sid&#39;s carcass.\n\n~ The End ~\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  An Epidemic of Jewelry Robberies\n  The Deception at Mrs. Ellingwood&#39;s\n  The Artificial Finger\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nAn Epidemic of Jewelry Robberies\n\nThere was, at the time, an epidemic of jewelry robberies. The pestilence had attacked Scofield&#39;s six times in four months; but the disease never &quot;took.&quot; The six hold-ups failed and in every instance the robbers were caught. Scofield&#39;s had a system of locks and alarms that appeared to be unbeatable.\n\nThen along came Judson Farris. Scofield&#39;s occupies the ground floor of a building on Maiden Lane. The store takes care of the retail business. To the rear of the store is a private office in which Mr. Scofield himself sells jewelry at wholesale; he also serves his more extravagant retail clients.\n\nJudson Farris entered the shop, handed a letter to one of the clerks and asked that it be delivered to Mr. Scofield. The clerk walked to the rear of the store and entered the private office. A few minutes later he returned and announced that Mr. Scofield would see Mr. Farris at once.\n\nFarris stepped into the private office, and as he closed the door, he noted absently that there was a latch attached to it. The latch was unique in appearance. It looked somewhat like the disc of a safe. When the mechanism was set, it was necessary only to close the door in order to destroy the combination. The door could then be opened only if the brass knob on the latch was turned and twisted in a certain way. To be sure, the combination was a simple one. Mr. Scofield, when ushering a person out of the room, could manipulate the latch so speedily that the client seldom became aware that he had been locked in.\n\nFarris, however, was little concerned with locks. He appeared to be quite indifferent to his surroundings. Such indifference was easy to affect, for the room was so sparsely furnished that everything could be taken in at a single glance.\n\nRunning parallel with the front wall was a low mahogany counter which divided the room approximately in half. In the space before the counter were three chairs; behind the counter were two flat-top desks. Two vaults were built into the rear wall.\n\nScofield, who had been seated at one of the desks, came forward to the counter and stretched out a hand in greeting. He said he was always glad to be of service to any of Mr. Moffat&#39;s friends. (Scofield was a member of the yacht club of which Moffat was president ; it was Moffat who had written the letter of introduction for Farris.)\n\nFarris said he wanted to buy a lavalliere. Scofield inquired as to the amount Farris wished to spend and Farris replied he didn&#39;t care to go over ten thousand.\n\nScofield went into the right vault, the door to which was open. The walls of the vault were lined with small drawers. Scofield pulled out two of the drawers. As he returned to the office, he glared frankly at Farris, who had half-turned and was looking up at a picture.\n\nScofield considered himself a shrewd judge of character. Farris was a tall, well-groomed man with a collar-ad face.\n\n&quot;Shallow,&quot; mused Scofield, &quot;but trustworthy and prosperous.&quot;\n\nThe two trays were placed upon the counter. In one of them were a dozen platinum chains; in the other, a dozen diamond pendants.\n\n&quot;These are assorted lots,&quot; explained Scofield. &quot;Please indicate your choice of the pendants, so that I can bring you another tray of pendants which are made along the lines of the one you like.&quot;\n\nFarris made his decision quickly. He chose a pendant which consisted of four graduated blue-white diamonds set in a small petal design. &quot;You need bring no other samples, Mr. Scofield. This is one of the prettiest drops I have ever seen.&quot;\n\nFarris thereupon made his choice of a chain. Scofield took the chain and the pendant out of the trays, ran the chain through the loop at the top of the pendant and dangled the lavalliere before Farris.\n\n&quot;How much will that set me back?&quot; Scofield consulted the tags. &quot;Seventy-three hundred, Mr. Farris. Eight hundred for the chain and sixty-five hundred for the drop.&quot;\n\nFarris remarked that he had with him a certified check for ten thousand and that if Mr. Scofield cared to, he could call up the Second National for verification. The deal seemed to be completed. Then Farris changed his mind.\n\n&quot;I think that yellow diamonds would look prettier on a platinum chain,&quot; he said. &quot;Could you let me see — ?&quot;\n\n&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied Scofield.\n\nHe picked up the two trays and took them into the vault. After a moment he came back and placed a pendant in the palm of Farris&#39; right hand. &quot;This is the exact counterpart of the one you chose, except that it has yellow stones.&quot;\n\nFarris looked at it a moment and then said, &quot;Put it on the chain, Mr. Scofield, so that I can see how it — &quot; Scofield glanced up sharply. &quot;I left the platinum chain and the blue-stone pendant with you, Mr. Farris.&quot;\n\n&quot;You are mistaken, Mr. Scofield. I gave the lavalliere to you and you took it with you when you went into the vault.&quot;\n\nFor a moment Scofield remained undecided. Then he went quickly into the vault, pulled out two drawers and came back with them into the office.\n\n&quot;As you can see, Mr. Farris, the trays on each of these drawers have hooks for one dozen pieces. I make it a rule never to display a tray which is not filled. As soon as one piece is sold, another piece is taken from our stock and put in the tray. In each of these trays one piece is missing. There are only eleven chains and eleven pendants.&quot;\n\n&quot;You may have dropped the lavalliere on the floor,&quot; suggested Farris. &quot;I know positively you had it in your left hand when you walked away from the counter to the vault.&quot;\n\nScofield began running a hand through his sparse hair. There was no doubt about his being nervous. He finally pushed a button which summoned a clerk. (The clerk had to unlock the latch with a key from the store side of the office door.)\n\n&quot;Bring in the vacuum,&quot; ordered Scofield.\n\nThe vacuum cleaner was run over every inch of the floor before and behind the counter. It was also run over the aisle in the vault. Some little dust was sucked in, but no lavalliere.\n\nAfter the clerk had left the room, the flustered Scofield ventured, &quot;You may have put the lavalliere into one of your pockets, Mr. Farris.&quot; Then he added — &quot;By mistake.&quot;\n\n&quot;That suggestion is a trifle — crude — isn&#39;t it?&quot;\n\n&quot;But don&#39;t you see, Mr. Farris, under — under the circumstances, you — you must have — &quot;\n\n&quot;Now see here, Mr. Scofield, I came to buy a lavalliere, not to be insulted. If you can produce the lavalliere, we&#39;ll complete the deal. Otherwise I must bid you good-day!&quot;\n\nAt this, Scofield became a trifle panicky. &quot;No, no! You can&#39;t leave till the lavalliere has been found. And there&#39;s no use trying — the door is locked.&quot;\n\nFarris shrugged his shoulders, lighted a cigar, and sat down. &quot;This is a new one on me. I didn&#39;t know jewelers made prisoners of their clients.&quot;\n\nScofield paced nervously back and forth behind the counter. He knew it would be useless to plead further with the obdurate Farris. Finally Scofield pushed a hidden button under his desk. A red light flashed over the police signal box in the street. After a few minutes, Gorman, a uniformed policeman, and Joe Deagon, one of the private detectives hired by a jeweler&#39;s association to patrol Maiden Lane, were admitted to Scofield&#39;s office.\n\nScofield explained the situation. Deagon decided that under the circumstances the lavalliere must be on the person of either Scofield or Farris. Thereupon Scofield turned all of his pockets inside out. The detective then insisted that Farris submit to a search.\n\nFarris emphatically refused to suffer this indignity. This put the next move up to the jeweler. He was faced with the alternative of permitting Farris to walk out of the shop, or having him arrested. And Scofield was in no mood to let seventy-three hundred dollars slip through his hands without making some decided gesture of self-defense.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t want to order your arrest, Mr. Farris,&quot; began Scofield, apologetically, &quot;but if you — &quot;\n\n&quot;Logically, that is the only solution,&quot; agreed Farris at once. &quot;I&#39;m as anxious to have this thing settled as you are. But I make this one condition: you will have to take me to the police station in a taxi, or if you wish, you may send for the wagon. And as we go from this office, I insist that I be surrounded on all sides. I want to make it impossible for Mr. Scofield even to hint that I might, at any time, have passed the lavalliere to someone else.&quot;\n\nThe condition was complied with. Farris was taken to the station in a taxi. Mr. Scofield, Detective Deagon and Officer Gorman accompanied him.\n\nAfter Farris had given his name to Captain Loury, the latter consulted a small memorandum book. Thereupon the captain called up Headquarters on the phone. As the captain put up the receiver again, he said to Farris.\n\n&quot;We have orders that in the event a Mr. Judson Farris is arrested. Headquarters be notified at once. I believe Detective James McKeane, a special-squad man, is personally interested in you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Nice fellow, James,&quot; smiled Farris. &quot;I shall be glad to meet him again.&quot;\n\nDetective McKeane reached the station after some twenty minutes. Once again Scofield rehearsed the circumstances under which the lavalliere disappeared. An immediate search was decided upon; Farris himself invited Scofield to be present.\n\nWhen a detective from headquarters executes a search, he makes a thorough job of it. Farris was taken into a private room and ordered to strip. He was wearing a minimum of clothing: a Palm-beach suit consisting of coat and trousers, a straw hat, a silk shirt, shoes, stockings and underwear.\n\nEvery square inch of this clothing was examined with the greatest care. A microscope was used; button by button, seam by seam the search proceeded — nothing was overlooked. A long, thin double-edged dagger was used to pry and probe for false heels or soles on the shoes. … The clothing yielded two handkerchiefs, four cigars, a silver match case, a watch and fob, seventy cents in change and a bill case. In the latter were three single bills and a certified check for ten thousand dollars.\n\nThey ran a comb through Farris&#39; hair; they looked in his mouth; they poked into his ears. Mr. Scdfield himself was satisfied that if Farris had had so much as a grain of salt on his person, McKeane would have found it.\n\nFarris was left to dress in the private room; Scofield and the detectives Gorman and McKeane came out into the main room of the station.\n\n&quot;He may have swallowed — &quot; began Scofield, gloomily.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t be absurd,&quot; cut in McKeane. &quot;If a man swallowed a twenty-inch platinum chain, it would kill him.&quot;\n\n&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; asked Scofield.\n\n&quot;Let him go,&quot; replied McKeane, promptly.\n\n&quot;Let him go! But man, don&#39;t you see that the circumstances being what they are, he must have stolen the lavalliere?&quot;\n\n&quot;If you wish to be personally responsible for his detention, and if you will prefer the charges yourself, of course we will hold him. But since you can&#39;t prove he has the lavalliere, I don&#39;t see how you can get a conviction — or even an indictment by the grand jury. You must admit that he has carefully protected himself. No one was present in your office but yourself — and for a few moments one of your clerks. And you have said that the clerk was never near enough to Farris to have the lavalliere passed to him. On the way here, Farris was protected by a policeman and one of your own detectives. And he was searched in your presence.&quot;\n\nBut a man doesn&#39;t lose seventy-three hundred dollars without a struggle.\n\nScofield held a forty-minute conversation with his lawyer over the phone. The lawyer&#39;s advice was that it would be a loss of time and energy to press charges. &quot;The certified check proves that Farris came to make a bona-fide purchase. And since you have not one iota of proof that he has the necklace, it would be futile to — &quot;\n\nScofield banged the receiveronto the hook and bustled out of the police station. McKeane informed Farris that he would not be held.\n\nAs Farris reached the door to the station, McKeane asked,\n\n&quot;As a personal favor, Judson old boy, would you mind telling me what you did with that lavalliere?&quot;\n\nFarris lighted a cigar.\n\n&quot;Are you hinting, Jim, that you or the captain might be wanting to buy it from me?&quot;\n\nAfter Farris had gone, Captain Loury remarked, &quot;The finger of suspicion certainly points in his direction.&quot;\n\n&quot;Not the finger of suspicion,&quot; said McKeane, &quot;the finger of guilt. But what can we do about it?&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Deception at Mrs. Ellingwood&#39;s\n\nClaude Lange gathered in the cards which had been tossed upon the table. He arranged the deck in two stacks; then he ripped each stack in half. He threw.the bits into the air, rose and stumbled away from the table. Another deck of cards was produced and the game went on. The club members were accustomed to Lange&#39;s idiosyncrasies.\n\nAn hour later, when Farris was leaving the club, Lange came up to him and asked if he could see Farris alone for a few moments.\n\n&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied Farris, &quot;but if it&#39;s about a loan — &quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s not — a loan.&quot;\n\nWhen they were in a room of Farris&#39; apartment on One Hundred and Twentieth Street, Lange said, simply, &quot;I know a woman who has a pear-shaped emerald drop on a platinum festoon. The drop alone, because of its unique design, is worth upward of fifteen thousand. Does that interest you?&quot;\n\nFarris regarded the other through narrowed eyes. Lange, he knew, had lost heavily that evening, and it was obvious that the loss had unnerved him. There had been rumors that with Lange&#39;s next disastrous plunge, he would be disinherited and disowned. Farris guessed that it was the fear of such a calamity that had driven young Lange to flirt with crime.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t quite get you, Lange,&quot; said Farris.\n\n&quot;Cut-out the innocence stuff! I&#39;ve heard about Scofield&#39;s lavalliere — we&#39;re members of the same yacht club. I&#39;m making no insinuations. Maybe the lavalliere was not stolen — in that case, you&#39;re not the man I want to talk to. You needn&#39;t be afraid to be frank. There are no witnesses — I couldn&#39;t prove anything on you, nor you on me. If you&#39;re really handy at making jewels disappear, say so.&quot;\n\n&#39;&#39;What&#39;s your proposition?&quot; asked Farris.\n\n&quot;Mrs. Ellingwood is giving a weekend party at her place in Great Neck. I can have you invited. If you get the stone, I get half the profits. Yes or no?&quot;\n\nFarris answered that he would be glad to be one of the guests at Mrs. Ellingwood&#39;s week-end party.\n\nMrs. Ellingwood entertained some ten guests. Farris and Lange arrived on Friday evening in the latter&#39;s car. Saturday passed and Sunday forenoon; in all that time, Mrs. Ellingwood had worn no jewelry of any kind except her rings.\n\nThen Lange drew Farris aside in the garden and confided, &quot;I&#39;ve taken the liberty to look about a bit in the house. There&#39;s a strong box in Mrs. Ellingwood&#39;s boudoir — &quot;\n\n&quot;So I noticed myself,&quot; smiled Farris. &quot;But the box is about ten-by-twelve-by-fourteen inches and it weighs several pounds. It could hardly be hidden under a Palm-beach suit. And even if we could get it out of the house, it would probably be missed at once and we&#39;d have to run for it. And that&#39;s one rule I never break — I never run away. I don&#39;t like the idea of being hunted.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well — couldn&#39;t you open the strong box somehow — ?&quot;\n\n&quot;All it takes is a little skill and a hairpin and — &quot;\n\n&quot;Then why not — ?&quot;\n\n&quot;And time,&quot; finished Farris. &quot;I&#39;d have to be certain no one would disturb me for at least half an hour. Of course, Mrs. Ellingwood stays downstairs with her guests. But there&#39;s the maid — she&#39;s in and out of the boudoir all the time.&quot;\n\nLange thought it over.\n\n&quot;Suppose — suppose that after dinner this evening, I succeed in coaxing the maid to take a spin in my car — &quot;\n\n&quot;Excellent — if you can manage it.&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll take much coaxing,&quot; grinned Lange.\n\nLange&#39;s evening, up to a certain point, was a grand success. The maid slipped in and out of the house unobserved. The two motored over an hour and Lange was not required to keep more than one hand on the wheel. But when, on returning, he again drew Farris aside, he could tell by the latter&#39;s downcast expression that the plan had gone awry.\n\n&quot;There was someone on the upper floor all the time,&quot; said Farris. &quot;I didn&#39;t have the chance to go anywhere near the boudoir.&quot;\n\nThe next morning the party broke up and Farris and Lange returned to the city.\n\nThe day was a rather hectic one for young Lange. He spent it trying to borrow the money with which to pay off the IOU&#39;s he had written during his last disastrous poker game. But Lange met with no success; his friends were unanimously of the opinion that it was a bad investment to lend him money.\n\nLange was haunted by the fear that some of his creditors might become obstreperous and threaten to sue. And he was now on his good behavior; any notoriety would serve to break the truce existing between him and his father.\n\nHis only asset was his car, which might bring two thousand dollars. He was in debt for over five thousand. If Farris had only succeeded in getting that emerald drop —\n\nAt nine o&#39;clock, Mrs. Cartwright called up Lange on the phone.\n\n&quot;Mrs. Ellingwood had me on the long distance wire a short while ago,&quot; said Mrs. Cartwright. &quot;She had intended going to the opera this evening, and she wanted to wear her festoon. She found that her strong box had been forced open and that the emerald drop had been clipped from the festoon. It&#39;s upset her terribly. The last time she used the strong box was on Thursday, so she can&#39;t be sure that one of her week-end guests is the thief. She&#39;s going to put a private detective on the case and instruct him not to bother any of her friends until every other possibility has been run down … .&quot;\n\nFarris had tricked him! Lange went into a paroxysm of fury. He paced his room repeating, &quot;The skunk double-crossed me!&quot; The deception was apparent; Farris had denied the theft so as to avoid the necessity of sharing the proceeds. And the enraged Lange decided not to let Farris get away with it.\n\nImmediate action was necessary. He would confront Farris and demand his share of the profits. If Farris tried to bluff … Lange took a revolver out of his bureau. It would be dangerous to match wits with a man of Farris&#39; cunning. But Lange, urged on by his lack of funds and by his anger against Farris, did not reflect long upon the risk. He was in the mood to play a desperate game and to kill, if necessary.\n\nSo the reckless Lange went forth on the quest which could end in but one way — disastrously . . .\n\nFarris admitted Lange into his apartment, led him into the sitting-room and then offered him a glass of wine. Lange impatiently waived his claim to hospitality and told Farris about Mrs. Cartwright&#39;s phone call.\n\n&quot;What rotten luck!&quot; exclaimed Farris. &quot;Someone else beat us — &quot;\n\n&quot;You stole that pendant!&quot; cut in Lange. &quot;I&#39;m here to demand a split!&quot;\n\n&quot;Are you suggesting that I may have — ?&quot;\n\n&quot;You double-crossed me!&quot;\n\nFarris became nettled at the other&#39;s insolence. &quot;I could throw you out of here, you know!&quot;\n\n&quot;You could try! But it&#39;ll be a man-sized job to get me out of here before I&#39;m convinced you haven&#39;t that stone.&quot;\n\n&quot;If it&#39;ll ease you any, you might search the place. Don&#39;t mind me. I&#39;ll have a few drinks while you&#39;re enjoying yourself.&quot;\n\nThat, in Lange&#39;s opinion, showed Farris&#39; hand. Farris had already disposed of the stone. There was nothing Lange could do … he could not even threaten blackmail. He was beaten. He had made it possible for Farris to attempt the job — and now Farris had cheated him out of his share.\n\nLange went momentarily mad with rage. Every semblance of self-control went from him. He lashed out furiously and caught Farris a stinging blow on the side of the head.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re going to take a beating!&quot; cried Lange.\n\nBut Farris met his rush with a straight-arm jolt to the wind which sat Lange neatly upon his haunches. Infuriated, the tears of chagrin streaming down his face, Lange drew his gun as he staggered to his feet.\n\nFarris closed in. They wrestled. Farris slipped and in his attempt to keep the gun from being twisted against his chest, he unfortunately put his hand over the front of the barrel just as Lange pulled the trigger.\n\nHis left hand crushed by ball and powder, Farris backed away. He reached his desk and jerked at a drawer. Lange sent a second bullet through Farris&#39; left shoulder. Farris fell. From a sitting position, he reached into the drawer and fetched his revolver.\n\nQuite deliberately he aimed at Lange who was sneaking out of the room. He fired and Lange crumpled to the floor. Then Farris, too, lapsed into unconsciousness.\n\nA woman in the next apartment telephoned for the police.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Artificial Finger\n\nThe next morning, Detective McKeane, after a visit to the hospital, called in the district attorney and announced that both Farris and Lange would pull through.\n\n&quot;And even though he&#39;s already disposed of the jewels, I got a confession covering the Scofield and Ellingwood robberies,&quot; said McKeane. &quot;Look here — know what this is?&quot;\n\nThe district attorney looked at the curious thing McKeane had handed him and shook his head.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s all shot to pieces — doesn&#39;t look like much now. But it was once the most perfect artificial finger ever fashioned by man! It took Farris one year to make it — and he was an expert at the manufacture of artificial limbs. Lost his own finger in an accident — the finger next to the pinky on the left hand. Cut off just above the knuckle. Well, he took his own finger and made a plaster mold of it. In the mold, he made this artificial finger of rubber and other substances. Feel it … you can&#39;t tell it from flesh. Look at the ridges — the veins painted in … and he could get a perfect finger-print with it! It will stand a microscopic test! It is hollow — that&#39;s where he hid the lavalliere!&quot;\n\n&quot;But how was the finger kept — ?&quot;\n\n&quot;He made a thin silver ring which fitted snugly around his stump; this silver ring was threaded. Inside the open end of the artificial finger he had another silver ring, also threaded … he simply screwed the finger on — and off! Matter of a few seconds! ^The artificial finger came over the stump: there was a slight visible line, which was painted flesh-color and then protected again by a gold band ring he always wore around the place where the finger and the stump joined.&quot;\n\n&quot;And the finger was perfect in every respect — ?&quot;\n\n&quot;But two. By sight or touch it could not be distinguished from a flesh and * bone finger. And by a few month&#39;s practice, he had even learned to move it! You see, with his stump, he could move it up to the first joint. The other joint he manipulated by pressure with his pinky. But in these two respects the finger was wanting: it did not take temperature, and if you squeezed hard, you could press it together. But in these latter respects, he was in little danger, since he shook hands with his right hand, of course, and there was no other reason why anyone should ever feel his left. Try to imagine me searching that guy for a lavalliere!&quot;\n\n&quot;H&#39;m. I should say it&#39;s a good thing he&#39;s in for a long siesta!&quot;\n\n&quot;Well … he&#39;s already promised that when he gets out he&#39;s going to make an artificial hand to replace the one Lange blew off of him. Then, he says, he&#39;ll be able to hide half a jewelry store. … &quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n"

A pinch!&quot;\n\nNewsboys and bootblacks were running excitedly toward the train gates of the X Polk Street depot. Travelers turned to see what it was all about, and then, casually, began to stroll toward the gates.\n\nA crowd was gathering.\n\nThrough the gates came two well-dressed, middle-aged men escorted by an officer. Across the waiting-room they were hurried and toward the door. One of the men, prosperous and dependable-looking, was angrily accusing. The other, equally prosperous-looking, even elegant-appearing in high silk hat, formal tailored clothes, and flowing Dundrury whiskers, was protesting vigorously against his arrest.\n\nStolidly the officer listened to both and continued marching them toward the door and the waiting patrol wagon outside. The crowd gaped in amazement as the two genteel, affluent-looking individuals were loaded into the vehicle; then it broke up in disappointment as the wagon rattled away.\n\nTom Silver, veteran detective of the Chicago Police, had been watching unobtrusively from across the waiting-room. Now he smiled a bit to himself and nodded his head in satisfaction. He had just turned to leave the depot and hurry down to the old Harrison Street lock-up, two blocks away, whither the men were being conducted, when he was suddenly accosted by an officer.\n\nHe turned to find Rawlings, the &quot;kid copper&quot; as he was called — a greenhorn on the Force, still in the first blush of great enthusiasm and wanting to learn all the details of the great criminal-catching game — at his elbow.\n\n&quot;Say, Silver,&quot; exclaimed Rawlings eagerly, &quot;I heard the desk Sarge say this morning that John Howells, the international diamond thief, was expected in town. I didn&#39;t look up his description, but you know all of them in the Squeal Book; do you think this fellow could be Howells?&quot;\n\nSilver frowned. This kid copper had a most annoying way of turning up just at the wrong time.\n\n&quot;No, certainly not,&quot; he responded crisply, and hurried away, leaving Rawlings much disappointed.\n\nHe arrived at the station just as the two men were being arraigned before a patrol sergeant on duty at the desk. Each of the two men, accuser and accused, told his story in detail.\n\nCyrus W. Armstrong, wealthy clothing merchant of Detroit, had been getting on the train when he had been unnecessarily jostled by two men. A suspicious examination had disclosed the fact that a valuable two-carat diamond scarfpin had been torn from his person. He had taken a good look at one of the men who had jostled him and had hurried out to call the police.\n\nThe man accused, giving the name of Robert Warren, drew himself up indignantly and protested volubly against such treatment being accorded an English gentleman who was traveling in this country for his health.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe International Diamond Thief\n\nSilver listened quietly. From the description, the incident had all the earmarks of a professional job. Despite the warm weather, the Englishman was carrying a light overcoat, beneath which the hands of the experienced crook work out of sight from the crowd. And as Rawlings had said. Silver knew his Squeal Book — that dictionary of wanted men — by heart.\n\nThe whiskers of the accused were considerably disguising, and his person had been altered in various other ways, but Silver was practically certain of his man.\n\nArmstrong insisted that a search be made, and so the Englishman was led into an adjoining room. Silver slipped in also and watched. They would probably find nothing, he decided, and he was right. The accused first took out his watch and laid it down in plain sight on the table; then he emptied his pockets to the last article, and, lastly, began to divest himself of his clothing with many caustic remarks.\n\nBut nothing was found resembling the merchant&#39;s diamond scarfpin.\n\nThe accused dressed himself again, carefully, and returned to the outer room where he received the apologies of the sergeant and the discomfited Armstrong. Then he walked out, a free man.\n\nSilver followed until they were clear of the building and fell into step alongside.\n\n&quot;An outrage, sir,&quot; he remarked sympathetically. The man looked him over sharply, remembered him, but as Silver was in plain clothes and well-dressed, probably did not connect him with the police.\n\n&quot;It certainly is,&quot; he retorted. And he added much more in the same vein. His air of injured innocence was impressive. Silver was sympathetic and condolent. He remarked that he possessed some influence politically and might be able to obtain redress.\n\nIn the same block with the station was Dan Cavanaugh&#39;s place, famous for its toddies, and Silver suggested that they go in and have a drink. Pleased with such a sympathetic listener, the man agreed, and they entered. Under the influence of the liquor with which the detective plied him, he expanded upon his woes until soon they were as thick as only thieves can be.\n\nThen Silver suggested a walk, and they left the saloon. Silver deftly steered his quarry around three sides of the block and arrived at the rear of the station and the entrance to the lock-up. Then he paused.\n\n&quot;Now then, John Howells,&quot; he said sternly, &quot;you&#39;re under arrest and you&#39;re going to be searched by me unless you want to talk business first.&quot;\n\nThe Englishman, taken by surprise, began to splutter again all sorts of protestations and threats. Silver displayed the little five-pointed star of the detective bureau, and marched his captive into the building.\n\nDown in the lock-up room, Silver inquired of the keeper for an empty cell. He was assigned one to his liking at the far end of Criminals&#39; Row where they would be safe from interruption. In the cell, the crook assumed an air of bravado and began to take off his clothes readily, first taking off his watch and laying it down carefully, on the bench.\n\nBut Silver motioned him to wait. He knew that the search in the room above had been most thorough and that there was no use repeating the performance. He picked up the man&#39;s watch, opened the back of it, and glanced at the crook in triumph. The watch was hollow, and inside was crowded Armstrong&#39;s diamond scarfpin.\n\n&quot;Now will you talk business?&quot; he queried.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Squeal Book\n\nAnd John Howells, cleverest international diamond thief of his time, nodded.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve got about five hundred on me,&quot; he suggested. &quot;Will that be enough?&quot;\n\nSilver laughed in his face.\n\n&quot;Who was your pal in the crush act?&quot; he demanded. &quot;I want him, too.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s not business,&quot; replied the crook wrathfully.\n\n&quot;It is business,&quot; replied Silver coolly. &quot;I know you had a pal to work the jam on Armstrong and I know he&#39;ll be down here first thing in the morning with a lawyer to get you out so you might as well tell me now and save time. I&#39;ll fix it up.&quot;\n\nFinally Howells admitted that his co-worker had been Isaac Posen, a Polish Jew, also internationally known to the police. Like all successful criminals, they had made arrangements beforehand with the best criminal lawyer in town and so had everything fixed for their defense in case they were caught.\n\n&quot;Who is the mouthpiece?&quot; queried Silver.\n\nThe crook mentioned the name of one of the city&#39;s foremost criminal lawyers. Silver nodded in satisfaction.\n\nThen, leaving Howells to meditate on the professional error in his ways, the detective locked the cell door. He noted the arrest at the desk of the lock-up keeper and told the keeper to hang the slip on the hook pending further investigation. Instead of turning in his duplicate slip at the desk upstairs, he tucked it into his pocket and walked out. There was now no record of John Howells&#39;, alias Robert Warren&#39;s, second arrest.\n\nNot knowing the description of Isaac Posen sufficiently well to run the risk of missing his man in disguise. Silver hailed a cab and went down to Central Station where he got down the Squeal Book and studied the face of the hook-nosed Jew that looked out at him until he had memorized it in all its details.\n\nIn satisfaction he noted that there were &quot;squeals&quot; up for the pair in London, Paris, and New York — a total of fifteen thousand dollars altogether being offered for their apprehension. In addition, it was well known that the lawyer the crooks had retained never touched a case under twenty-five thousand dollars.\n\n&quot;Big fish in the net today,&quot; he chuckled as he closed the book and started away.\n\nBut just outside the station he bumped into Rawlings.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going up and look in the Squeal Book, Silver,&quot; the latter said enthusiastically. &quot;I&#39;m going to post myself on this John Howells, and if he ever comes to town I&#39;ll nab him quick.&quot;\n\nSilver had hard work to keep back an oath. But it required some quick thinking.\n\nMight as well save your trouble,&quot; he said amiably. &quot;We just had word that Howells is arrested in Toledo. He&#39;ll be sent to New York directly, and so you&#39;ll probably never see him around here. You come along with me and I&#39;ll tell you anything you want to know about the rest of them.&quot;\n\nRawlings jumped at the chance and plied the veteran with questions for several blocks; then, when Silver had finally taken his departure on the plea of an urgent case, Rawlings looked after him with some suspicion.\n\n&quot;Silver is up to something again,&quot; he muttered. &quot;I&#39;d like to know what it is. Perhaps if I told him what I&#39;d found out about the Dunning pearls, he might come around. The necklace was stolen, Silver recovered it, although he swears he didn&#39;t, a lot of money changed hands somehow, he one was ever arrested, and neither Silver nor Dunning will say a word about it. That&#39;s funny. I think I&#39;ll just run up and take a look at the Squeal Book, anyhow.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nPosen and the Criminal Lawyer\n\nAnd, down in one of the corridors of the Woman&#39;s Temple Building, near the door of the spacious offices occupied by the criminal lawyer, Silver was lounging, smoking a good cigar and scrutinizing the faces of those who entered.\n\nFinally a furtive, hook-nosed individual, dressed in the height of fashion but with a worried frown upon his brow, got out of the elevator and sidled to the lawyer&#39;s door. Silver entered close on his heels, but found the crook already closeted with the attorney. Without heeding the efforts of several clerks to deter him. Silver pushed open the door of the private office and stepped in.\n\nThe great criminal lawyer rose with an exclamation of wrath at the interruption, but calmed down when he saw who it was. Posen had just been explaining that Howells had been arrested, searched, and turned free, but that he had again fallen into the hands of the law for some reason. The Jew had hung around the station and seen his pal taken in the back way by a man who was unquestionably a detective.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s the man, now!&quot; exclaimed the Jew in alarm as he scrutinized Silver thoroughly.\n\n&quot;Sure,&quot; replied Silver genially, &quot;and just consider yourself under arrest for the present.&quot;\n\nHe explained matters to the lawyer, who was known as a man always ready to listen to reason. The lawyer heard him out calmly, while the Jew twisted his hands in agitation. When Silver had finished the lawyer broke into a quizzical smile.\n\n&quot;What would you suggest?&quot; he asked.\n\nSilver considered. &quot;Best to get them on the train tonight and ride them out of town,&quot; he returned.\n\n&quot;And your share?&quot; asked the attorney.\n\n&quot;Five thousand cash.&quot;\n\nAt that the lawyer demurred. He said it was much too high a figure.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll have to work fast,&quot; replied Silver evenly. &quot;The twenty-four hours I can hold Howells on suspicion will not last long. I&#39;ll have to turn in the slip and book him on charges pretty soon. And remember, I&#39;ve got the goods.&quot;\n\nHe extracted Howells&#39; false watch from his pocket and held it up. He opened it and blue-white gleams flashed from its interior.\n\nThe Jew broke down at that and commanded the lawyer to do anything that was asked to get them off. The lawyer shrugged his shoulders and acquiesced.\n\nBut hardly had they gone into a consultation on ways and means than the private telephone at the lawyer&#39;s elbow jingled. The voice of a clerk in the outer office came over the wire. The lawyer exclaimed in annoyance.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s an officer out there by the name of Rawlings,&quot; he said to Silver, &quot;who says he&#39;s trailed you here and wants to see you immediately. Says he&#39;s found Howells in the Squeal Book and knows it was the man arrested this morning.&quot;\n\n&quot;My God!&quot; exclaimed Silver. &quot;Is there a side door we can get out?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot; The lawyer indicated the way.\n\n&quot;All right. See you at the station tonight, the 8:40 New York Central. Come along, Posen; you&#39;ll be my guest for the rest of the afternoon.&quot;\n\nAnd, grasping the frightened Jew by the arm, Silver hurried him out the back way.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Slip\n\nA few minutes later he was at the Harrison Street lock-up. He paused to speak to the keeper as he went in.\n\n&quot;Tear up the slip,&quot; he requested. &quot;Made a mistake in my man and am turning him loose. Wasn&#39;t the bird I thought it was.&quot;\n\nThe lock-up keeper took down the slip and tore it up so that now there was no evidence that one Robert Warren had been detained. Silver had already done the same to his duplicate. He hurried Howells out of the station and accompanied both crooks to the luxurious suite of rooms they had engaged at one of the leading hotels. He remained with them for the remainder of the day.\n\nAt 8:30, they met the lawyer in the station and all four of them boarded the train. The crooks had a great amount of baggage, and Silver, always helpful to a client, had picked up a small brown bag which he carried for them.\n\nThe quartet occupied adjoining seats facing each other during the run down to Michigan City, first stop on the line, and Silver sat with the bag between his feet. The crooks eyed him nervously and had little to say. The lawyer sat back, regarding Silver and the crooks, with a twinkle in his eye.\n\nFinally the whistle blew for the stop, and Silver and the lawyer rose.\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; remarked the detective easily, &quot;I&#39;m glad to have met you gentlemen. Hope that we meet again sometime.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hope not,&quot; they both responded in unison, and laughed a little nervously. They seized upon the brown bag at the first opportunity and thrust it under a seat.\n\nIn the station at Michigan City the lawyer turned to Silver and handed over a long manila envelope containing something that crackled crisply. Silver pocketed it with a smile of satisfaction.\n\nThere was some time to wait until a train back to the city could be obtained, and they sat down to wait. The lawyer turned to Silver with a grin.\n\n&quot;You had them pretty well worried,&quot; he said, chuckling. &quot;Do you know what was in that grip?&quot;\n\n&quot;Must have been swag,&quot; replied Silver. &quot;It was pretty light.&quot;\n\n&quot;You bet it was swag,&quot; said his companion. &quot;There was thirty thousand dollars worth of diamonds in that! You missed a big haul.&quot;\n\nSilver shrugged.\n\n&quot;I suspected it,&quot; he returned, &quot;but I had made a bargain, and I always keep my word. My honor is impregnable.&quot;\n\nAnd both of them laughed.\n\nNot long afterward Finks, the pawnbroker, purchased a diamond scarf pin, entering a bogus description of the seller, and the triumphant Rawlings returned it to its owner in Detroit.\n\nBut detective Silver made sure to keep out of the way of the &quot;kid copper&quot; for some time.\n\n~ The End ~\n\nWatch for further &quot;Adventures in Graft&quot; in upcoming issues of THE RED FILE and on this site. Observe how Rawlings, the &quot;boy detective,&quot; becomes the Nemesis of the crafty Silver, and how Silver frames him and gets him bounced. Rawlings then pulls a hot one on Silver, who, much surprised, decides the kid is too clever for an enemy; so he convinces Rawlings they should enter into partnership, and together they start out to crook the crooks. But the crooks are ready for them.\n"

Under various aliases, he had led a dozen different wives to the altar — and later followed them to the grave. In each instance he had survived to find himself a wiser and richer man.\n\nNaturally, the statutes concerning bigamy had never troubled him. In every venture he had been legally free of his previous bride before contracting the responsibilities resulting from another wedding. And by uncanny good fortune, the laws against murder had left him unscathed and unsuspected.\n\nSince the days of his youth, Bruckner had worshipped Bluebeard as his hero. In his teens, he had devoured newspaper accounts of the doings of such modern maniacs. Invariably their unskillful slaying of successive spouses, in order to collect insurance, had ended in their intimate association with the scaffold, the electric chair or the guillotine. Bruckner would smile in his sleeve over their clumsiness, and in choosing his vocation, resolved that he at least, would never be so crude.\n\nInsurance companies, he had learned, were customarily curious, and the profession which Bruckner proposed to enter made inquisitiveness on the part of others extremely undesirable. In the first place, he determined never to give his name to any maiden or widow who carried a policy on her life. Should his prospects be insured, they must allow that protection to lapse upon the assurance that the bridegroom possessed plenty for two. Thus he eliminated one source of suspicion as to his motives. If, however, those who ensnared his accordion-like heart happened to be wealthy, Bruckner certainly could not be blamed. Besides, he always made it a rule to state to the license clerk that he was a bachelor, casually adding that he was well-to-do and retired.\n\nThis knowledge was also the bait he persistently dangled in order to catch his intended victims. The plan had been remarkably successful, to which Bruckner&#39;s worldly possessions bore mute testimony. Frequently money talks — but Bruckner&#39;s was as silent as the graves from which it had been obtained. Under each new alias, he maintained a modest bank account for current expenses. None of them had been large enough to cause him any regret if he suddenly found it inconvenient to cash another check or present himself in person to claim his balance. The bulk of his fortune he kept in cash in several widely separated safe deposit vaults. To the banks where these sums were stored, he was known under various names, and was understood to be an eccentric man who traveled extensively.\n\nThe names he assumed for this purpose were never employed for any other form of his activities. His long absences and semi-occasional appearances caused no comment, and had never resulted in any undue curiosity. In fact, the officials of these &quot;reserve&quot; institutions, as he termed them, were not aware of the contents of the boxes Bruckner rented. Probably they imagined that he used them for storing papers.\n\nOne, however, did contain something vastly different. In it were the tools of his trade — poisons of varying natures which he picked up at intervals in infinitesimal quantities in various parts of the world. Being versatile, he liked to vary his method of operation and took a genuine pride in his work. Mad he undoubtedly was — but the man was an artist, and no manufacturer or financier or creator of beautiful things ever took more satisfaction in his accomplishments than did Bruckner.\n\nThe one fly in the ointment was the fact that he could never confide to anyone just how clever he really was. To atone for this, and by way of diversion, he occasionally indulged in criminalities of a totally different nature, in fields where he might share his triumphs with others. He had a smattering of medicine and knew much chemistry, both of which he studied with sinister intent. He had played at being an amateur cracksman and had been complimented upon his skill in opening safes. Likewise, he had participated in several notorious black-hand outrages and was well and favorably known in those circles. That is, the personality he assumed for this purpose was known to such associates. Thus Bruckner had broadened his knowledge of ways and means of producing death in secret, and had familiarized himself with other branches of the trade, upon which he might fall back in case wife murder ever became an unhealthy occupation.\n\nBruckner flattered himself that during the whole of his career he had never made a single mistake. Not once had he been regarded as anything but a sincere mourner at the biers of his dear departeds. Never had he run afoul of coroner or police. At times he chuckled over his remarkable capabilities and congratulated himself upon his caution and truly exceptional foresight. Perhaps his success was due to the fact that he concentrated upon crime in its more subtle branches, and had never been addicted to any vice, either petty or great.\n\nNor had a pretty face ever tempted him. During the whole of his marital adventures, Bruckner had never once been in love — not even the victim of a passing infatuation. Business before pleasure was his motto and he adhered to it strictly. Because, he found the courtship stage of his engagements a trying ordeal, marriage usually followed his proposals swiftly. With grim humor, he often boasted to himself that he had no heart, and in view of this fact, he was reluctant to indulge needlessly in silly lovemaking.\n\nThe women of his choice were invariably rather mature and usually unromantic. The more homely they might be the better satisfied he was. A young and attractive wife might have admirers who would interfere with his plans. She would also be more likely to have relatives who might have too much to say and to whom her death would be a real bereavement. Widows with children were banned. He had an aversion to stepsons and daughters about the house. Instead, this pseudo lonely bachelor always sought a matron similarly situated — each with a tidy sum to support them, and both desiring a quiet comfortable home.\n\nThere was method in his rule. Not only was he assured of privacy in the domicile about to be established, but he could not be accused of the unpardonable crime of marrying for money. Bruckner was both sensitive and proud. He valued the good opinion of the community — because it was an asset in his curious business. To pick out a bride of great wealth would mean additional difficulty in collecting his inheritance after the obsequies. Such details would be bound to be annoying and Bruckner loved simplicity in this respect.\n\nA few thousand dollars — always less than his own little nest egg — and perhaps a small property upon which no other heirs had any claim — were to be readily gathered in without the formality of court proceedings or the advice of counsel. After each deal, he cashed in his gains, opened a new bank account under a new name, and stored his net profits in one of his safety deposit boxes. This had been going on for years.\n\nIt was true that such gradual means of accumulating wealth necessitated many marriages. None of his wives had lived more than three years after the wedding, but in no case did he cause a death under twelve months. He remained prudent rather than avaricious or hasty. He never sought a rapid denouement at the risk of personal safety. Moreover, his wives all died seemingly natural deaths and were fittingly interred. Bruckner would not countenance anything so crude as to savor of murder. Also, Bruckner had a certain sentiment about proper burials. As a result each simple ceremony was marked with unostentatious respect, while the countryside was dotted here and there with nicely cared for graves and tastefully adequate tombstones. Everything he did was done very well.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Simple, Practical, and Resultful Plan\n\nWhen analyzed, Bruckner&#39;s plan was as simple as it was practical and resultful. He would go to a small town and take a comfortable room at a cheap hotel or boarding house, frequented only by men. Without undue heraldry, he would announce that he was seeking a suitable place to end his days. After he had attained the age of fifty, this sounded reasonable, so he discarded the various fantastic stories so successfully circulated during his youth. These had been ingenious, but rather more risky. In fact, he now looked back with concern upon the chances he had taken in connection with his first alliance — contracted when he was twenty. His initial venture had culminated admirably, however, and his four successive ones — covering a scant ten years — also paid him neat profits.\n\nNow, when he was installed in a new and temporary residence, Bruckner would make it a point to scrape up a speaking acquaintance with a few substantial but humble souls in the neighborhood. He never associated with those who were prominent or overly endowed with worldly goods. He could not afford to make a permanent name for himself. He was always fading out of or into a picture. He was but a passing incident in the life of each community. To his chosen cronies, he would casually state that he was a plain man without frills. He regretted that he had not settled down and taken unto himself a life companion before he had grown too old to think of matrimony.\n\nFrequently this observation would bring forth good-natured chuckles and sly winks. Male matchmakers would pass on the word to their romance-hatching wives, and soon several no longer young hopefuls would begin to preen themselves and press Mr. Bruckner to drop in for tea. Reluctantly, he would accept, and begin to judiciously sound out the situation. If all seemed well, he would guardedly hint of his state of mind and eventually suggest a married partnership on the basis of mutual contribution to costs and common connubial convenience. If the proposition met with a favorable reception, and the recipient of his attentions appeared pliable, the marriage would be solemnized at no distant date.\n\nWhen this portion of the program was over, Bruckner would bide his time before springing the climax of his little drama. There were several phases of the stage setting to be considered. If his newly acquired wife was not possessed of real property, and there seemed no reason for their remaining where they were, he would find some good incentive for moving to another city. The death of a middle-aged matron causes less comment in a neighborhood where she is a stranger. Such a move made, he could proceed at his leisure, without engendering gossip or unwelcome sympathy.\n\nOf course, where a wife possessed valuable lots and houses, or perhaps a little business, he must gradually make excuses to dispose of these, or else remain on the spot and wait until he could do so as sole executor. Practice had made him perfect, no matter which course he was forced to take.\n\nIn any event, no sooner would the funeral be forgotten, than Bruckner would move on. Invariably those who had known him expressed their regret and felt genuinely sorry for the lonely, broken-hearted man. Once or twice a second candidate had coyly sought his attention, but such women had no chance whatever. Under no conditions would Bruckner marry twice in the same town, or even under the same name. His various ventures were widely separated as to scene.\n\nHe would shake his name together with the dust of the deserted community, and assume a new and equally commonplace one upon his arrival in the section selected for his next proceeding. That little matter of choice of names indicated his extreme cleverness. Never was he known by a distinctive cognomen. His surname was likely to be the most numerously mentioned in the local directory.\n\nFortune favored Bruckner in that he was a man whose appearance made his age seem uncertain. As he pleased, he was readily able to subtract or add ten to twenty years from the truth. Then, too, he made a careful study of personal appearance, and without resorting to artificial means of disguise, had in his box of tricks several methods of altering his looks. Little niceties of dress — a different manner of brushing the hair — and the time-worn cultivation or destruction of moustaches, beards, side-whiskers and imperials all served his purpose upon occasion.\n\nPossessed of an excellent memory, a perfect capacity for forgetting the past, and a penchant for looking into the future, Bruckner was well equipped. He was devoid of conscience — insensible to sentiment — and looked forward to the day when he might safely write his memoirs — to be published posthumously.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Desire to Kill Her\n\nSuch was the man who found himself a widower for the twelfth time last fall.\n\nUpon casting up his accounts after the final ceremonies of that funeral, Bruckner (as he then elected to style himself) discovered that his total fortune amounted to some two hundred thousand dollars. It was safely stowed away in his safe deposit strongholds. He had remaining — under the new name of Bruckner — sufficient capital to see him through his next adventure. The surplus he did not mean to touch — as usual.\n\nYet in the weeks that followed the death and the settlement of the estate of his most recent wife, Bruckner seriously considered the idea of remaining single. Like many another prosperous man — after years of striving — he longed for a life of indolence — broken of its monotony by such pursuits as might please him. He hated the very thought of a home. He had no wish to settle down. He had possessed a surfeit of wives that he did not want in a personal way. Bruckner had married them in the casual course of business.\n\nAnd this gave him a thought — in the nature of a vacation. Suppose he should seek a spouse who actually pleased him. Thus far he had not experienced such a genuine pleasure. For a man married as much as he, the situation was silly. Yet Bruckner had his doubts. If he paid court to a young and beautiful girl — one whom he really admired — he might, even after the passage of all these years, fall in love with her. That would prove fatal. He had heard of idiots, drunk with love, who told their wives everything.\n\nThat would never do. In the first place, the lady might not prove sympathetic. Also, he was certain that sooner or later he would desire to kill her — from sheer force of habit or perhaps from ennui — since he no longer needed money. Such a situation would be awkward if he became devoted to her — for then he would break the heart which had been proof against Cupid&#39;s darts through all these years of many marriages.\n\nSo he relinquished the thought and went to New York to rest up a bit and think the situation over. As usual, he went to a modest hotel. Yet the days he spent alone were tedious, and like a fish out of water, he longed to plunge once more into the matrimonial sea. For a time he had whiled away some of his hours in the company of a Russian, who claimed to have been a watchmaker to the late Czar. This gentleman still made timepieces — but he made them to put in bombs, and made them very well. His genius appealed to Bruckner and the two became quite friendly, although Bruckner was slightly nervous lest the police should visit the bomb maker&#39;s place while he was present.\n\nHowever, he had no other company. His safe-cracking friends were all in jail — and the others were safe beyond the reach of the law — or else had been reached by it and removed from this vale of tears. So he found himself craving for action and the further exercise of his remarkable talents. Then he met Mrs. Mary Corcoran, a healthy husky lady who was doomed to become his wife from the first moment he saw her.\n\nMrs. Corcoran was a widow of just the proper age — not too wealthy, Bruckner thought, although she was possessed of a trifle more than her predecessors. She owned a place by the seashore and was extremely fond of bathing. She had a little motorboat, and at the time when Bruckner entered her life, was about to open her bungalow for the season.\n\nThe situation appealed to Bruckner. He needed a rest and a change of clime, and a stay by the sea would be welcome. It would do him good and build up his health while he planned how to break down hers. So he mentioned to the widow as much of his plan as was fitting for the lady to know. She proved entirely agreeable — even eager, Bruckner thought. In fact, he was rather afraid that she was in love with him. That might prove awkward, but it could not be helped. So he married her and took a solemn oath that when this adventure was over, he would never again tempt fate.\n\nThe bungalow was on a little sandy point, some miles from the nearest town and the railroad station. Mrs. Bruckner, nee Corcoran, taxied back and forth from the village in her motor-boat when her fancy suggested such journeys or purchases required them. Bruckner spent much of his time sitting on the beach with his pipe and his thoughts, and practically lived the life of a married hermit. They got on together beautifully, and Bruckner thanked his stars that the woman did not desire him to be eternally complimenting and petting her. Her sole aim was his comfort, and never in all of his thirteen marital ventures had he lived so pleasantly and contentedly. It almost seemed a shame to terminate such an ideal arrangement. In fact, it would be little short of a crime.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nMrs. Bruckner\n\nBut just as he knew he would, Bruckner reverted to type. He simply could not resist the temptation to kill the woman. She did not annoy him. He had nothing against her, and he did not wish her money. Just the same he wanted to kill her, and he wanted to do it in some new and original way.\n\nFor days he thought it over, and grew more perplexed with the passage of the time. He could not sleep at night, and he found himself nervous and restless. His appetite began to fail — a condition unheard of before — and even his pipe and tobacco failed to solace him. Once or twice he wondered whether it would not be wise if he went out and got drunk. He vetoed that idea, however, for he had always made it a rule to keep his head clear and his brain unfuddled. Drunken men and women, Bruckner always said, are inclined to talk too much — and he was a man of silence. Besides, the hooch lately available, had, in cases, proved fatal.\n\nDuring all of his meditation and perplexity, Mrs. Bruckner remained in blissful ignorance of the thing which was troubling him. It was true that she seemed to suspect that something was wrong, but when she pressed for an explanation, he naturally put her off. She appeared to be alarmed about his health, and was constantly urging him to go and consult a physician. He flatly refused, and told her he had never been sick in his life. Of course he knew what was the matter, and also knew very well that no physician&#39;s prescription would cure his ailment.\n\nHis wife made more frequent trips to the little village, and even went to New York to bring back dainty viands to tempt his appetite. Apparently her sole ambition in life was to prepare a dish that would tickle his palate, and Bruckner was not without some appreciation of her kindness and concern. At times, he almost resolved to put away his idea and let the woman live. But impatience to have it over with, and to be at peace with the world, mastered him at last.\n\nHis intentions crystallized into action on the morning when she announced her intention of going over to Calder&#39;s Point to attend a pinochle party. Bruckner never played cards and said that he would not go. However, he even urged that she indulge in this pleasant diversion.\n\n&quot;You stay around me too much,&quot; he pressed her tenderly. &quot;You&#39;re wearing yourself out looking after my health. Stop worrying, and have a good time while you may — I mean while you&#39;re still young and have your health,&quot; he added, realizing that he had almost made an unfortunate slip.\n\n&quot;All right, I will — if you really don&#39;t mind,&quot; she agreed, and explained that the party would occur on the following Monday night. She proposed to take the motorboat over, leaving at seven o&#39;clock; remain for the night, and chug-chug back again the following morning.\n\nBruckner was delighted. A sudden inspiration had plunged him into an ecstasy of joy. At last — like a bolt from the blue — he had hit upon a plan to do away with the woman. It was entirely possible that the thing had been done before, but it was new with Bruckner. It could not possibly savor of design and it would happen while she was away. He would be presumed to know nothing of the accident until the heartrending news should be brought to him. Then he would be stunned. Bruckner was a past master at registering grief — surprise — anguish.\n\nBut after the funeral he could spend the entire summer at the bungalow in undisturbed peace. He was glad that he could accomplish his purpose so early in the spring; for unlike the average man, his thoughts did not lightly turn to love in that entrancing period.\n\nThe thought necessitated a visit to his friend, the clockmaker to the former Czar. He made it, and outlined his needs minutely. That is, he told the clockmaker precisely the sort of box he desired — how long and how wide it should be — and explained just how its timepiece was to be set. It was to be put up in a candy box and tied neatly with ribbon. It should weigh five pounds and bear the wrapping of a smart confectioner. On the day he meant to use it, Bruckner would call for the box. It must be ready, and everything must be fixed so that he would not need to unwrap it.\n\nMrs. Bruckner was going away in her little sea-taxi at seven o&#39;clock. He would arrive from the city an hour before. He planned to reach the bungalow via a hired launch, timing himself to get there a little late for supper, but in time to bid her good-bye. When he did so he would thoughtfully put the candy box in his wife&#39;s motorboat, calling her attention to it, and laughingly instructing her not to nibble at its contents during the journey. He wished her to save it for the party and present it to her hostess.\n\nHe hoped she would obey. The trip would take her a little more than an hour. She did not mind that, since she loved the sea and could handle her craft as well as any man. But if everything went well, Mrs. Bruckner would never land at the wharf at Calder&#39;s Point. Just about fifteen minutes before she was due to reach that settlement, the little clock would tick its final tick, and Mrs. Bruckner would proceed to eternity instead of the pinochle party.\n\nThe complete simplicity of the scheme appealed to him strongly. He would put the bomb near the gasoline tank. Its explosion would destroy that container and everyone would surmise that the blowing up of the fuel store had caused the tragedy. No one but the dead woman would know about the candy box — that is, no one but the clockmaker of the Czar. That gentleman would not be likely to speak. Secrecy was also essential to the success of his profession, and in such matters he was strictly honorable and thoroughly reliable. He need not know for whom the box was intended and for reasons of his own he would not inquire too deeply into the matter.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nDaylight Savings\n\nEverything went as planned. On Monday morning Mr. Bruckner announced that it would be necessary for him to go to the city in connection with some business at his broker&#39;s. He promised to return as speedily as he could, but told his wife not to wait for him if he should not be home by the time she intended to leave. That was camouflage, carefully planned. He always thought of little details like that in order to turn away suspicion from the minds of his victims. Besides, he wanted to establish an alibi and have it known that he was away all day.\n\nMoreover, he always disliked to be around his victims just before the climax of his cunning. Their very confidence and trust in him always tended to annoy him. But he knew very well that he would be back on time. Otherwise, of course, he could not place the candy box in the little launch.\n\nThe clockmaker was ready for him, and the box itself was a beauty — as creditable a piece of work as Bruckner had ever seen. It did not weigh too much nor too little, and while he was assured that the watch was perfect in its mechanism and timing, it did not give forth the slightest sound.\n\nThe clockmaker beamed when he saw the look of admiration in Bruckner&#39;s eyes and told him that he might trust the little bomb implicitly. &quot;It is worthy to blow up a Prime Minister!&quot; enthused its author. &quot;Unfortunately, these days, kings are few and trade is far from good. The war seems to have caused an unreasoning dislike for explosives on the part of my very best customers.&quot;\n\nBruckner condoled with the man and took his departure. He had received the professional word of the watchmaker that the bomb would not go off if he were to drop it and that it would not explode until eight-fifteen precisely. That was as Bruckner wished. The detonation would be heard just as the motorboat was entering the waters about Calder&#39;s Point and would startle those on shore waiting for his wife. In all probability the bomb would tear her to pieces and wreck the boat completely. At least it would utterly destroy itself — and the gasoline tank. That was, of course, essential — for there must be no remaining evidence, even though no clue could possibly point to him.\n\nBut because the time schedule of the railroad had been changed without his knowledge, Bruckner did not arrive at the bungalow until almost seven o&#39;clock. It had been a narrow escape from being too late, and the incident made him nervous; yet in a way, he thought, it was fortunate.\n\nMrs. Bruckner was down at the landing, dressed in her best bib and tucker, and she greeted him with a smile and an inquiry as to his health.\n\n&quot;You look tired, my dear,&quot; she sympathized in a motherly sort of fashion. &quot;I really hate to go away and leave you.&quot;\n\n&quot;I am tired,&quot; Bruckner confessed.\n\n&quot;I guess I&#39;m not as young as I used to be and I haven&#39;t been right pert for the last few weeks. I&#39;ll soon be better, however,&quot; he added cheerfully. &quot;Just you go on and have a good time, and don&#39;t give a thought to me.&quot;\n\nThen he produced the candy box and displayed it to her. The boatman who had brought him was gone by this time, and he had not seen the package which Bruckner had kept wrapped in a newspaper until this very moment. Now Mrs. Bruckner took it in her hands and plucked at the ribbon, but he shook his finger at her as he might do to a naughty child.\n\n&quot;Now don&#39;t be impatient or selfish!&quot; he reproved. &quot;Keep it until you get to the party. Then offer some to the others with my compliments.&quot;\n\n&quot;I suppose I should do that,&quot; she agreed with him. &quot;And now I must be going. There&#39;s a light under the coffee on the stove, and your supper&#39;s on the table. You won&#39;t mind a cold snack, will you?&quot;\n\n&quot;No,&quot; said Bruckner, and then the one flaw in his plan occurred to him. How could he make sure that she would put the candy box where it would certainly destroy the gasoline tank? He could not, if he left it in her possession. Of course it would kill her, but that was not enough. His plan must work out exactly as he had intended, and the only way to insure its perfect success was to go along in the boat.\n\nThat, in a way, was a risk, but Bruckner was equal to the situation. It required quick thinking, but he had a bright idea on the spot.\n\n&quot;Well!&quot; he reproached himself, &quot; if I didn&#39;t forget my tobacco! I guess I&#39;d better go back as far as the station with you, and then get one of the public launches to bring me home. It won&#39;t take more than half an hour, and I&#39;ll eat supper later.&quot;\n\nSo he took the candy box from his wife&#39;s hands, and helped her into the boat. She went directly to the little engine and started it as he stepped aboard. The bomb would not blow up for about an hour. In twenty minutes he would be at the station landing. When he got out, he would put the candy box by the gasoline tank and lay a tarpaulin over it, with the explanation that he did so to keep it from being wetted by the spray. Mrs. Bruckner would think nothing of his doing that, and would probably forget all about the candy until it reminded her of itself forcibly.\n\nSpeedily the little boat chugged away from the wharf and cut the waves like a knife as it shot off toward the station pier. It was twilight, growing gradually darker, and lights began to twinkle from the group of cottages ahead.\n\n&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Bruckner suggested to his wife, &quot;I&#39;ll stay over at the post office for a while. Maybe I can get some of the men to play a game of pool, and go back home about ten o&#39;clock. Supper being cold, it won&#39;t make any difference, and I can make some fresh — &quot;\n\nBut he never made it. There was a terrific crash. The little motor launch was rent asunder. When the detonation died away, there was nothing left but a few pieces of floating wreckage, and, curiously, a red ribbon floating on the surface of the sea. Bruckner and his wife had been blown to atoms.\n\nThe clockmaker had worked well and the bomb had gone off precisely as he had planned — at the hour appointed by Bruckner himself. But the former creator of timepieces for the Czar was not a man who read the daily papers. In preparing the bomb and setting the clock, he had not known of the fact that the daylight saving law for the season went into effect at the stroke of two that morning. Hence the explosion had occurred just one hour earlier than Bruckner had expected it would.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nEnough Poison to Kill an Elephant\n\nBut simultaneously with the crash that ended the lives of the Bruckners, two strange men appeared before their little bungalow. The visitors on the beach looked out to sea, not knowing that the criminal they sought was now beyond their reach.\n\n&quot;Gosh!&quot; one of them exclaimed. &quot;That gasoline certainly made a thorough job of it! It won&#39;t even be worth while to send out a rescue boat.&quot;\n\nThe other detective shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m more interested in what we&#39;re likely to find inside the house,&quot; he said. &quot;Since nobody seems to be home, suppose we go right in.&quot;\n\nThey did, and they made a thorough search, including a chemical analysis of the coffee on the stove and the cold snack on the table. It was a delicious looking little layout of tempting morsels, but the chemist who tested it whistled loudly in amazement when his task was finished.\n\n&quot;The old girl must have been in a hurry to finish this chap!&quot; he announced. &quot;She&#39;s put enough poison in all this stuff to kill an elephant. Funny, too — because she always worked slowly before — &quot;\n\n&quot;Before?&quot; questioned his companion. &quot;Is she one of those fiends who marry a lot of men and murder them for their insurance?&quot;\n\nThe chemist nodded. &quot;She was tried twice and acquitted for lack of convicting proof — but we&#39;ve been watching her ever since, and her mug&#39;s in the Rogues&#39; Gallery under the alias of Arsenic Annie.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n"

He knew a window was being raised somewhere below stairs. He was sure he was to have a visitor. He had expected, even hoped for, this man to put in his appearance for the past several nights. Now he had come. Stanlaw knew that, just as he knew the exact reason for his coming.\n\nHerbert Stanlaw was a man a little past thirty years of age — a tall, straight, athletic individual, with a rather handsome face, tanned to a rich brown by much living in the open; a broad forehead, black hair, and keen, dark eyes. He had about him the air of a man who enjoys life immensely — of one who was in the habit of extracting a large amount of enjoyment from the little, everyday things, as well as from the ones of greater proportions.\n\nHe was wealthy, educated, and had traveled much, often pushing his way to some little-known spot of the earth, seeking rare curios and studying the language and customs of some almost- extinct people. He still was a student and spent much of his time in investigation — anything which offered a new angle of research. This work often led him along strange lines and brought to him many amusing experiences.\n\nStanlaw now had laid aside his book and sat tensely listening. From somewhere below stairs he caught a faint, almost imperceptible sound — like the tread of a cat that stalks a mouse.\n\nHe snapped off the switch of his reading lamp, leaving the room in darkness. Some one was creeping softly up the stairs. Then the waiting man heard the sluff-sluff of soft-soled shoes along the hall.\n\nNow Stanlaw knew the intruder must pass his door before entering any one of the second-floor rooms. He waited, breathing softly, as he listened to the man making his almost noiseless way along the hall.\n\nSuddenly Stanlaw saw a denser blur in the darkness that choked the doorway leading to the hall. Once more his hand found the switch, gave this a turn, and the room suddenly was flooded with a blinding white light.\n\nThere, framed in the doorway, stood a man. The lower part of his face was covered by a black mask, his cap was pulled low over his eyes, but he was blinking in the sudden, staggering glare.\n\nStanlaw still sat in his chair beside his reading table, his right arm outstretched, a heavy automatic pistol in his hand, carefully covering the man before him.\n\n&quot;Come in,&quot; he said pleasantly.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThat Ruby\n\nThe burglar stumbled forward and Stanlaw motioned him to a chair. When he was seated, Stanlaw continued:\n\n&quot;No doubt, my friend, you know something about guns. If you do, you will recognize the one which I have trained on you at present as being of a very fast, very deadly type. I dislike to pay myself the compliment but I will say that I know how to use it. Last year I won first honors in the tri-State revolver shoot. Now, may I trouble you for any weapons which you may happen to have concealed about your person? Remember, no tricks, either.&quot;\n\nFor a moment the burglar looked steadily into Stanlaw&#39;s eyes. He evidently saw in the calm, cool man before — him one with whom it would be folly to trifle, for he brought forth from his coat pockets a blackjack and a pistol, the latter almost identical with that which Stanlaw was holding. He threw the blackjack on the table, theft extended the pistol, butt first, to Stanlaw, making a mock bow as he did so, Stanlaw took the gun and placed it on the table, his own close beside it.\n\n&quot;That is better,&quot; said he. &quot;I think we can talk now without danger of interruption.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, since you have me at your mercy,&quot; the stranger began, &quot;I suppose the next thing for you to do is to call in the police.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Stanlaw assured him, &quot;the next thing for me to do is to ask you to remove your cap and mask.&quot;\n\nHis fingers toyed with the butt of the heavy automatic.\n\nWithout a moment&#39;s hesitation the man removed his cap and took away the piece of black cloth which had concealed the lower part of his face.\n\nStanlaw noted, with a little thrill of satisfaction, that this was not the ordinary type of burglar. The fellow was well dressed and he had about him an unmistakable air of refinement. His face was rather sharp and he had a thin, straight nose, reddish-brown hair, and bold, brown eyes. His lips were thin, almost colorless, and his mouth drooped slightly at the corners. His well-kept hands, with their long, slender fingers, were as white and shapely as those of a woman. They were the hands of an artist almost.\n\n&quot;And now, my friend,&quot; Stanlaw was saying, &quot;I can tell you that, in so far as you are concerned, I have no business with the police. I shall deal with you alone.&quot;\n\n&quot;What! Don&#39;t you mean to turn &#39;em loose on me ?&quot;\n\nGenuine amazement expressed itself in the man&#39;s words.\n\n&quot;That is exactly the meaning I tried to convey,&quot; Stanlaw replied. &quot;You see, I rather welcome your coming. I took your gun simply as a matter of precaution. I know exactly what you have come for, but I cannot know to what means you might resort in order to achieve your ends.&quot;\n\n&quot;I fail to get you exactly,&quot; the burglar confessed.\n\n&quot;You know, do you not, that I have in my possession a very valuable ruby — a stone that has quite a history — and one that you would, no doubt, prize very highly ?&quot;\n\n&quot;I do.&quot;\n\n&quot;And you&#39;ve come for that ruby?&quot;\n\n&quot;Frankly speaking, I have.&quot;\n\n&quot;And, just as frankly speaking, it is yours.&quot;\n\n&quot;What!&quot;\n\nAgain amazement was written large in the burglar&#39;s face.\n\n&quot;I said the ruby was yours. It now rests in that cabinet over there in the corner, third drawer from the top, right-hand side. Remember the location. I shall ask you to go for it in a little while.&quot;\n\nThe man sat speechless. He plainly showed that this was something he had not expected.\n\n&quot;But,&quot; Stanlaw continued, &quot;before you go for the ruby I wish to tell you a little story. I assure you it will not take a great while, and, as you still have the greater part of the night before you, need have no fear of the police, and — I trust — are quite comfortable, I can see no reason why you should object to listening.\n\n&quot;You see, I wish to make this thing perfectly clear to you; and, as this story, which I am about to relate, has to do with this same ruby, it is one which you should know, since you intend to have the stone in your possession when you leave this room.&quot;\n\nThe man settled himself more comfortably in his chair and smiled, saying: &quot;Go to it.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nStanlaw&#39;s Story\n\nStanlaw pushed matches and a pack of cigarettes across the table toward the burglar, at the same time lighting one himself. He then went on:\n\n&quot;A good many years ago, when my great-grandfather was a young man, he, in company with three others of an equally adventurous nature, were traveling in the interior of China, and while there they heard of a mandarin in one of the upper provinces who possessed what was said to be the finest ruby in the whole world.\n\n&quot;Now I am going to be entirely frank with you, and while one always should speak reverently of the dead, I am going to tell you that my great-grandfather was a bad sort. He was a man who, when he really wanted a thing, would stop at nothing which would aid him to carry out his desire.\n\n&quot;Well, as I said, my great-grandfather and his companions heard of this wonderful ruby. Of course my ancestor wanted it, as did each of the others. But they pooled their interests and started out to get the stone, my great-grandfather trusting that, by fair means or foul, it would come into his hands in the end.\n\n&quot;When the four adventurers reached the city wherein lived the mandarin who owned the wonderful ruby, they found that it was going to be a difficult task to obtain an audience with the old gentleman, to say nothing of getting a glimpse of the famous ruby.\n\n&quot;The mandarin was a very old man. He had come to be looked upon as a prophet by his people, and thus was held in great esteem.\n\n&quot;At last, however, by some method known only to themselves, the adventurers obtained an audience with the mandarin. Arriving at his house, a servant showed them into an almost bare room where, on a low divan, reclined a man of incalculable age. His yellow skin was dry and seamed and cracked like leather that has been exposed to the elements for a long period of time. His hair was gone and his hands, with their thin, bony fingers and long, pointed nails, were like the talons of some bird of prey. His legs were withered and he could not walk, but in his eyes there burned an unquenchable fire, and his tongue still retained its powers. A great book lay open on the floor at his side, while the pungent odor of incense, burning in a tall censer, filled the room.\n\n&quot;My great-grandfather, who spent some little time in China and who knew a bit of the language, carried on the conversation with the old man. He told the mandarin they had heard of the wonderful ruby which he had in his possession, and asked that they be allowed to look upon the priceless stone.\n\n&quot;At this the old man became very much agitated. He replied that none but the faithful servants of his own gods had ever looked upon the sacred fire which burned in the heart of the ruby and which had been there since the beginning of the world.\n\n&quot;The ruby, so the old man said, had been given to the first man of his family, when the world was still young and the race but beginning, by the daughter of a great Chinese deity, who had found it one day while walking by the sea. There was not in the world enough money to buy it, and my great-grandfather, still insisting that he must see the ruby, was ordered from the place.\n\n&quot;At first he refused to go but suddenly something caused him to turn and glance to the rear. What he saw there seems to have brought about a swift decision. A curtain had parted in what before had appeared to be a portion of the wall of the room, and in that space there stood a man who was tall and powerfully built — a giant almost — with a long, naked blade in his hand. The four adventurers, realizing that the moment for their departure had arrived, hastily left the room.\n\n&quot;Having the story of the wonderful ruby confirmed by the old mandarin himself only made them more determined to possess the stone, so they at once set about perfecting their plans for securing it.\n\n&quot;First they must arrange to get safely away. This they accomplished by securing the services of several natives of an adjoining province, who happened to be in the city at the time and who agreed, for a certain sum in gold, to guide them safely across the border.\n\n&quot;Then came the real problem of securing the ruby. How were they to enter the mandarin&#39;s house? And how were they to find the stone, once they had forced an entrance, not knowing where it was concealed?\n\n&quot;Then it was that my great-grandfather, who seems to have possessed the brains of the party, decided that the only way to secure the stone would be to enter forcibly the mandarin&#39;s room, slay the guard, if there was a guard, and then compel the old man to reveal the whereabouts of the ruby.\n\n&quot;Well, they succeeded in getting into the room. The big man again was there, but was surprised before he could defend himself. He went down at the first blow from the butt of a revolver in the hands of my great-grandfather. The old man, who still was on the divan, was quickly seized by one of the party, who clapped a heavy hand over his mouth, thus preventing any outcry.\n\n&quot;They then demanded the ruby, and the old mandarin, of course, refused to make known its whereabouts.\n\n&quot;Then, their anger running wild because they had been foiled at this point in the game, they began a system of torture calculated to make a man give up anything which he might possess, if by so doing he would be able to allay the terrible agony which was being inflicted upon his body.\n\n&quot;First they stood the old man on his head for long periods of time, always demanding the ruby. When they found this was of no avail they tied his hands behind him, twisting his arms until they were almost tom from their sockets. Notwithstanding that the old man had told them such dogs as they could not inflict pain upon one protected by the gods as he was, his old, mummy-like face twisted itself into the most horrible grimaces, and it seemed that his eyeballs were being forced from their cavities.\n\n&quot;This also failed. Then they placed their victim in a chair; one of the men sat before him with a leveled revolver and counted off the time, swearing that at the tenth count he would fire.\n\n&quot;Several times they tried this, but it brought no results. They were growing tired, as well as desperate, so my great-grandfather told the old mandarin he should have but one more chance. He still refused to reveal the whereabouts of the stone, you see, and the adventurers well knew if they killed him they would never discover it. That was the only reason they had spared his life so long.\n\n&quot;This time they stretched the old man on the floor; my great-grandfather took a long, keen knife, held it directly over the heart and began to press down. The sharp point sank into the old mandarin&#39;s flesh and blood began to flow from the wound, but still he would not speak.\n\n&quot;Then it was that my great-grandfather, becoming terribly angry, said with an oath that the old man should never speak again. With this he seized the mandarin&#39;s tongue, drew it out to its full length, then severed it.\n\n&quot;And as he did so something fell from the old man&#39;s mouth and rolled upon the floor. One of the party bent down and picked up this thing. It was the great ruby, all wet and sticky!\n\n&quot;Then, though there were in the room only the four adventurers, the unconscious guard, and the old mandarin, who seemed to be breathing his last, there came a voice in their midst, and this voice, thin and high-pitched as had been that of the old man, put upon that stone a curse so terrible that the faces of all four of the men blanched with fear, though but one among them could understand the awful significance of the words uttered.\n\n&quot;Death, violent, hideous, damnable, he invoked upon whosoever should undertake to keep in his possession that stone. Upon some would death fall instantaneously; upon some would it come like a lingering, withering blight, causing them to pray for the release which would be for many, many days denied them.\n\n&quot;The man who had picked up the ruby suddenly crumpled in a heap on the floor. He died without a word. Then another of the adventurers, with an oath, tore the stone from the dead man&#39;s hand, wrapped it in a bit of oiled silk and concealed it about his person. With that he and the two others left hurriedly.\n\n&quot;On the way to the coast this man was bitten by a viper. He lived several days, tormented by an intense suffering, finally dying in great agony. This left but my great-grandfather and one other of the original quartet. This other man had taken the ruby from his dying companion. .\n\n&quot;A few days later he was stricken with a slow fever, deserted and left to die in the jungle by my ancestor and the native guides. My great-grandfather had, of course, lifted the ruby, and he swore that he would get safely out of China with the precious stone — that no heathen curse could have power to bring harm to him.\n\n&quot;Well, he finally reached the United States and went to his old home to live. Shortly after arriving there he died a very singular and painful death. His body appeared to have been burned from head to foot. The ruby then went to my grandfather. He took the stone to the river, intending to dispose of it by tossing it into the water. He was found some time later, drowned, and the ruby was picked up on the shore near the point where he was last seen alive. After this the stone went to an uncle of mine, then in succession to two of his sons. All have died sudden, and, in most cases, violent deaths. The stone now has come into my possession, and I am confident something of the sort will in a short time happen to me, unless I can dispose of the ill-fated thing.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n&quot;I Didn&#39;t Come For Your Ruby&quot;\n\nThere was silence in the room, save for the little clock on the mantel, that ticked out its monotonous measures of time.\n\n&quot;I think,&quot; Stanlaw said at last, &quot;that is about all. If you are ready to do so, you may now get the ruby.&quot;\n\nThe man hesitated, looking at Stanlaw in a startled sort of way. Seeing this, Stanlaw took both guns from the table, dropped them into a coat pocket, then went to the cabinet in the corner of the room. He pulled out one of the small drawers and returned with it to the table. From this drawer he took a leather case, opened it, and there, wrapped in many folds of oiled silk, was the great ruby. He unwound the covering, exposing the stone to view.\n\n&quot;Take it up,&quot; he told the man.\n\nThe fellow did so, then dropped it quickly. His thumb and index finger, where they had come in contact with the stone, were stained the color of blood!\n\n&quot;Ugh!&quot; He shivered, wiping his fingers on a handkerchief, which he then threw upon the floor. &quot;You couldn&#39;t hire me to take that thing.&quot;\n\nWithout another word Stanlaw re-wound the silken covering about the ruby, replaced it in its leather case, then dropped it back into the cabinet drawer.\n\n&quot;I think I&#39;ll be going,&quot; suddenly announced the burglar. &quot;Since I&#39;ve thought of it, I didn&#39;t come for your ruby, anyway. I merely thought I did. I wonder if you&#39;d let me have my gun. Rather costly things now, you know.&quot;\n\n&quot;Certainly; take it along,&quot; Stanlaw told him, handing over the gun. &quot;It looks like a good one, and you may have need of it some time. You can go out by way of the front door, as it is not fastened. Sorry you will not take the ruby. Good night.&quot;\n\nThe burglar immediately went through the doorway, and Stanlaw heard him hurrying along the hall and down the stairs. A little later the closing of the front door told him the man had gone.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Result of the Experiment\n\nOnce more Stanlaw seated himself in his big armchair beside his reading table and lighted another cigarette.\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; he mused, &quot;my friend, Jimmy Steele, certainly did an excellent job on that story he wrote for the Sunday Courier, in which he described the fabulous ruby which I was supposed to keep lying around as though it were a bit of colored glass.\n\n&quot;I was sure the story would bring some one, and it did — a fine specimen. The old ruby has practically no value but the story I told the man so impregnated him with a sense of fear that he would not have taken the thing for worlds. That was a brilliant idea of Steele&#39;s — putting the heavy, red ink on the stone. The fellow really believed it was blood.\n\n&quot;Anyway, to-morrow I must write my old friend, Professor Cosgrove, the result of my experiment, as this will be another link in the long chain of evidence which he already has gathered, and will add weight to his claim that fear, especially fear of the supernatural, is the ruling element of the world.&quot;\n\nMidnight came and Stanlaw decided he had best make the rounds of his lower floor before retiring. The window whereby the would-be burglar had entered must be attended to and the front door fastened.\n\nWith these things in mind he went down the stairs to the lower floor. First he entered his dining room, and the sight which fell upon his eyes there caused him to halt with a sharp gasp of astonishment —\n\nStanlaw always had been rather proud of his collection of old silver, cut glass, and rare and beautiful china, owning many pieces of value.\n\nPractically everything worth taking was gone. A small safe, built into the wall and which had been concealed behind the buffet — wherein the more valuable pieces were kept — now stood open and empty.\n\nThen it was that Stanlaw saw a note spread out on the dining table. It had been hastily scrawled with a lead pencil. Taking it up, he read:\n\nDear Friend:I feel that I should not leave your house without first expressing a few words in appreciation of your kindness. That was a fully good story you told me about the old ruby.Of course I did not believe a word of it but it had a convincing ring, all right. Just as soon as I saw the ruby I knew it was worthless. It has a flaw in it a blind man ought to be able to discover.But, as you will have learned by this time, our little expedition has not been altogether without profit.While I was being so well entertained in your room, my partner was very busy below stairs. Thanks for giving him plenty of time.We both wish you better luck in the future.\n\nSlowly the tense muscles relaxed and a smile spread itself over Stanlaw&#39;s face.\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; he said thoughtfully, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll not write Cosgrove, after all. The joke seems to be on me!&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n"

The Red Parrot’s owner, Ernie Trauber, darted a narrowed gaze at the tall form of the lanky reporter. Trouble, serious trouble, too often happened where Andrews turned up. For more than one reason the big, florid-faced Trauber wondered if the newshawk’s aimless attitude might not be only pretence.\n\nGracie, the cigarette girl, started oft toward Andrews’ table the minute she spotted him, a bright, glad smile on her crimson lips — there was something in the young-old eyes of the newspaper man that attracted women. Trauber watched narrowly, saw her nod as the newshawk held up three fingers, questioningly. The night-club owner’s heavy jowls tightened, and a deep, slow flush of anger crept up his thick neck.\n\nThat was it, he concluded. Sure, Grace had been near when he’d told the doorman to signal him the minute any of Mike Malone’s hoods showed up. She’d tipped off the news monkey that three of them were coming. Well, Mike had said that his cannons were making only a nice, friendly visit.\n\nBut Big Ernie Trauber was worried. Suppose Mike, growing racket boss, had changed his mind since he’d argued him out of making the Red Parrot pay tribute? He and Mike had been pals in the old days, but Mike’s night-club protection racket had grown — and Mike Malone, the big boss, was getting greedier by the day … . Anyhow, that smart dame Grace had no business blowing off to Andrews. It might all mean nothing, but be didn’t like to have the bad-luck scribbler around on a night like this. And did Mike have to send three hoods?\n\nAcross the smoky club Trauber’s gaze met the reporter’s, and the latter saw that his three-finger questioning had been observed.\n\nGrace circulated among the tables, silken tights gleaming against Hie soft eurvee of her nimble legs. Trauber went to his small office on the main floor, there to have her sent to him. He’d teach that dame a thing or two … .\n\nErnie Trauber rang for one of his floormen, told him to send Grace in. But Grace didn’t come. Instead, the floorman returned with a note from &quot;Tight-spot” Andrews. Trauber cursed and dug into his desk for a special bottle when he read the newshawk’s three-word note:\n\nI wouldn&#39;t, Trauber. — Andrews\n\nA couple of years ago, Ernie Trauber had beaten up a check-room girl. She had been afraid to bring charges for fear Trauber would see to it that she got plenty from a hired strong-arm thug or two. Ernie Trauber did things that way.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nAn Extensive and Detailed Study\n\nTight-spot Andrews lolled boredly at his table, apparently too lazy to even touch his highball. Andrews was worth his weight in gold to his paper. It was good for circulation to have a star reporter who often figured more in sensational headlines than did the police themselves.\n\nThe newshawk had made an extensive and detailed study of every known criminal that he could in his five years of reporting since he’d left college. He claimed that complete knowledge of their personal lives was invaluable, but it seemed miraculous to even his city editor how he managed to be on the scene of so many shootings. And nearly always Andrews got into a spot from which it seemed humanly impossible to escape; hence the nickname.\n\nTonight, however, Tight-spot Andrews was unarmed. In the recent cleanup of a desperate narcotic ring, too many narcotic peddlers had been found dead — with bullets from Andrews’ pistol in them. His license had been recalled by a cantankerous official, who maintained that the newshawk was gaining a killer’s reputation and that legitimate killing should be left entirely to the police.\n\nAndrews had recently dropped in at Malone’s &quot;front,” a medium-sized ice plant, and chatted with the racketeer on whom the police were aching to pin a heavy rap. Andrews wasn’t sure, but he thought — from Malone’s growing pretentiousness — that he was about ready to spread his reign of tribute-collections, even as far as his old pal Ernie Trauber.\n\nAndrews figured that Trauber might be stubborn, relying on his past friendship with Malone to get out of paying tribute money. There might, just possibly might, be something hot doing — if Malone decided to bump off Trauber as an example to other night-club owners. Such things had been done before. And Andrews wanted proof for his paper. He wished that tonight he were armed. He shrugged finally. It had always been his boasted theory that no matter how tight a spot a man got into, there was always some possible way he could think himself out of it … .\n\nJoe Sauchelli was the first of Mike Malone’s henchmen to enter the nearly empty Red Parrot, and Andrews drew back a bit into the semi-shelter of his booth-table. It might not do to be seen. If something really were to come off tonight, Malone’s outfit wouldn’t want a witness running around loose. The few remaining patrons of the early morning didn’t matter: half tipsy and unobserving, and obviously not of the type to recognize underworld characters.\n\nBut John Andrews of the Dial knew the Malone outfit, and the Malone outfit knew him.\n\nTight-spot Andrews watched Joe Sauchelli, saw tk racket thug wander slowly by Ernie Trauber. The two spoke briefly, and then Sauchelli seated himself at a table near a center part of the small dance floor. Andrews studied the man’s face and then drew back farther into his booth and reviewed the main characteristic of Sauchelli — thirst for vengeance.\n\nA year ago Sauchelli’s brother, Luigi, had been found murdered in his apartment. Joe had been trying to find his killer with all the intentness of an emotional Latin nature. Joe had never been either pleasant or unpleasant, but since his brother had been murdered — with some heavy blunt object, and no clue of the killer found — his lean, olive-complexioned face had become a dull, saturnine mask from which vicious little eyes gleamed, questioningly, ever searchingly. He was a small man, physically, but stocky and tough.\n\nA few more customers reeled out of the Red Parrot, homeward bound, and then Tony De Carlo came in. A big, lumbering man with heavy features, he repeated the wandering perambulations of Sauchelli, ending up at the table with his racketeer pal.\n\nAndrews could see that Ernie Trauber was becoming perceivably nervous.\n\nIn fact, Trauber wondered for a moment or two if he should not have hired a few hoods for the night, just in case. But he quickly reasoned that he could argue Mike Malone’s organization out of making him hand over a cut from his profits. Sure, he could argue his way out of it again. Hell, hadn’t he and Mike been old-time pals.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Three Gunmen\n\nThe third malone henchman, Frank Adamo, a catlike, light-stepping gunman whose mouth twitched nervously, came in when the place was almost deserted. With scarcely a word to Trauber, he joined the first two.\n\nTight-spot Andrews suddenly realized that something was doing. The three men were obviously waiting for the night club to become entirely empty. Andrews was about to formulate a plan of leaving the place and returning, somehow, through a window, to watch, when Sauchelli suddenly turned and peered in his direction. Tight-spot drew back farther into the shadows of his booth. But then, he saw that it was too late — he had been spotted.\n\nThe three gunmen talked together for a minute or two out of tight, scarcely moving lips. Then De Carlo lifted his rumbling weight from his chair and walked carelessly to the newshawk’s booth. With feigned surprise he pretended to discover suddenly the reporter from the Dial.\n\n“Well, if it isn’t our great big newspaper hero. Come on over and have a drink with us. The boys’ll be glad to see you tonight.”\n\n“No, thanks, De Carlo,” Andrews replied lazily, then added: “I’m leaving soon, anyway.”\n\nThe gunman’s heavy face was rutted with smiles, but his hand slipped slowly toward a lapel of his coat as he returned slowly, heavily: “Oh — no, you’re not — big boy. We — like your company.”\n\nFor a moment the reporter did not move. Things were beginning to look bad. He should have gone out earlier, as he’d contemplated, and returned from the rear some way to watch from a safe, hidden vantage point.\n\n“Oh, all right,” he said finally, shrugging, “since it will please the boys so much.”\n\nAdamo greeted Andrews with mock heartiness, but the gimlet-eyed Sauchelli merely nodded coldly and gestured toward a chair. Andrews sat down. De Carlo filled a glass for him from a bottle in the center of the table.\n\n“What’s up, boys?” the reporter asked after several long, silent moments.\n\nThe three eyed him slowly, and then De Carlo said: “Nothing — nothing at all, Tight-spot. Just takin’ it easy, having a few drinks. Why, we like to have you with us tonight.”\n\nHe paused, then added: “Besides, what if something is up? Ain&#39;t you Tight-spot Andrews, who says he can always figger a way out?”\n\nAndrews made no reply, but he was thinking swiftly, desperately — and finding no way out. He felt sure that there was something up, and that since he had seen and recognized the three, something else would be up: his own number. After whatever was coming off came off, or even just before it, his life wouldn&#39;t be worth a wooden nickel.\n\nGracie, the cigarette girl, passed by, dressed for the street. But Andrews saw by her face that she was entirely unaware of the situation. He could hope for no help from her. She had given him the steer for which he had asked her. She obviously thought he wanted the present situation. With a brief smile she was gone.\n\nJohn Andrews&#39; heart sank. He hadn’t thought any way out of this spot — yet. He smiled slightly, cynically, and thought: “Tight-spot Andrews — huh. What a swan song!”\n\nAdamo saw the smile and asked: “Enjoyin&#39; yourself at last, eh, Tight-spot?”\n\n“No!” Andrews flared back, angrily. Then he was on his feet, starting out of the place.\n\nSauchelli and Adamo glanced swiftly around, hands darting gunward, noticing that although Trauber was just shooing out the last of his tipsy customers, waiters and bus boys were still working around the place. Then De Carlo had the reporter’s arm in a viselike grip.\n\n“Now — be a sport, Tight-spot,” De Carlo was saying. “The party ain&#39;t finished yet. We gotta finish this bottle. Sit down and I&#39;ll show you a little trick, make a little bet with you.”\n\nJohn Andrews allowed himself to be slowly shoved down on his chair, realizing that the gang didn&#39;t want to give him the works with any witnesses around. Just what the works would be — he wondered.\n\nSilent until now, but watchful, Sauchelli suddenly called out: “Come here, Trauber, we want you in on this party, too — until the joint is cleared.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Dollar Bet Against Your Life\n\nErnie Trauber came over to the table, his big frame, which dwarfed even De Carlo&#39;s size, moving stiffly. He stopped the nervous tightening of his heavy jowls with an effort. Before he could speak, Sauchelli added:\n\n“And your hood, too.”\n\nTrauber hesitated, then turned and beckoned his floorman over.\n\nSauchelli moved back from the table so he could face both squarely, and his hand rested significantly inside his coat.\n\n“You can&#39;t buck this outfit, so be good,” he said. “We&#39;re too strong.”\n\nAndrews could see that from the floor-man, at least, there would be no trouble. A cheap little gunman in a theatrical dinner jacket, his face was paling with abject fear.\n\n“Now, we&#39;ll all enjoy the little trick Tony’s gonna do to keep Tight-spot amused until everybody else is outta this joint.”\n\nDe Carlo grinned with the pleased happiness of a man who loves to show off, as he said: “Well, I guess it&#39;ll be the good ol&#39; dollar bill and glass and nickel trick.” He placed an empty tumbler on a dollar bill laid flat on the table; then he carefully balanced a nickel on the rim of the glass.\n\n“How much you bet, Tight-spot, that you get the dollar out without touchin&#39; the glass, and without knockin&#39; the nickel off the edge?”\n\nAndrews shrugged. He didn&#39;t know the trick; he wasn&#39;t interested in the trick; he was interested only in saving his skin.\n\n“Oh, couple of sawbucks,” he said. “I’d bet a couple of sawbucks you can’t do it. I can’t figure any way. You might just happen to miss. I figure my odds are better that way.”\n\nDe Carlo grinned. Carefully, without touching the glass, he rolled an end of the bill against the glass. Holding the ends of the roll between thumbs and forefingers of both hands, and still without touching the glass, he kept rolling the dollar. He did this slowly, evenly, forcing the tumbler to move smoothly along the bill until clear of it, on the table doth, and with the coin still balanced.\n\nAndrews accidentally moved a knee against the table, and the nickel tinkled down inside the tumbler.\n\n“Okay,” he said quickly, “you win. That was an accident.”\n\nThe reporter started to reach inside his coat for his wallet.\n\n“Hold it, Andrews!” Sauchelli snapped, and glanced around the now empty room. “Frisk him, Tony.”\n\nTony did, said: “He’s clean, Joe.”\n\n“Okay, now case the joint, Tony. And make sure everybody’s gone.”\n\nThey all remained silent, motionless, until De Carlo returned and reported that, “The joint is like a graveyard, boss,” and laughed raucously.\n\nFrank Adamo laughed, too, and his laugh was even more significant than De Carlo’s.\n\nTrauber’s face had become stoical, impassive. But his floorman was cringing visibly, although he was silent — knowing that anything he could say could never change whatever was slated to come.\n\nSauchelli’s automatic was out now as he ordered: “Tony, do your stuff — the way I told you.”\n\nAndrews watched Tony’s face turn from a smirk to a sullen scowl as he frisked Trauber and his lieutenant, shoving the guns into his side pockets. Then De Carlo herded them both into the night-club owner’s office, where he turned on a radio — loud.\n\nAndrews thought to himself: “They’re getting ready fast, and I haven’t thought pf a way out of this one.”\n\nAdamo grinned evilly, got up and walked across the club to its entrance. He pulled aside an inch or two of lowered blind and stood there looking out.\n\nSauchelli kept his automatic lazily covering Andrews, who watched De Carlo, Trauber and the floorman come out of the office. Trauber stopped beside Grace’s glass-enclosed cigarette stand, the fat roll of the night’s take held in one hand.\n\n“All right,” De Carlo was saying, “hand over fifteen per cent of the night’s business. I’ll count it out.”\n\nTrauber glared and shouted: “Malone can’t do this to me — we’re old pals!”\n\nDe Carlo didn’t say a word, but his scowling face and steady gun muzzle — his very silence — spoke more than words.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nA Regular Gang Killing\n\nBoiling anger welled up in ernie trauber, and a slow flush of rage crept up the big man’s bull-like neck. Even through a red haze of fury, he tried to reason with himself to pay the cut to the outfit against which it would be impossible for him to pit himself. But anger won out … .\n\nCraftily, Trauber held out the money. De Carlo reached, but before his gun-free hand could touch the money, Trauber dropped it to the floor and darted behind the cigarette stand. At the same time, the dapper little floorman started to duck.\n\nTony De Carlo was quick for such a big man. He snapped a quick shot that took the little gunman in the throat and laid him out dead on the floor on his back. Ernie Trauber was making a plunging dive toward the inside of the show case, and De Carlo’s gun roared again.\n\nA tiny hole appeared in Trauber’s forehead. But the big man’s dive had already commenced. He kept going, his clawed, outstretched hand seeking the gun hidden among the cigarettes and cigars inside the show case. There was a crash of broken glass, and Trauber lay still; his right fist, clutching a handful of cigars, was poked through a jagged hole in the front glass of the case.\n\nThe radio blared on, an ironic blanket of aound for exploding cartridges.\n\nDe Carlo picked up the fallen money, then glanced back at the cigarette stand. He saw Trauber’s grotesquely grinning face and the outstretched hand holding the cigars. The show-off in De Carlo was irrepressible.\n\nGrinning, he plucked a cigar from the hand and said, ‘&quot;Thanks, pal,” and then, noticing a streak of blood on the cigar, he threw it away and spat after it in disgust.\n\n&quot;Cut the horseplay,” came Sauchelli’s sharp voice. &quot;Come here with that dough.”\n\nDe Carlo brought the money over to the table, where Sauchelli had calmly sat and watched the double murder, keeping Andrews covered at the same time.\n\nAgain De Carlo’s smirk turned to a scowl, and he said: &quot;Okay to give this damn scribbler the works now, eh, Joe?”\n\n&quot;No, you fool,” came Sauchelli’s quick reply. &quot;Why do you think I didn’t do that already. This has just gotta be a regular gang killin’. It’d raise too much stink to have a reporter’s stiff found here — and I don’t aim to have no corpse rddin’ around with us. We’ll tie him up, hold his nose an’ make him drink plenty whisky, till he’s good an’ drunk. Then we’ll just have a good ‘live drunk in the car — in case … . Well take care of him later.”\n\nTight-spot Andrews had been doing a lot of thinking during the past few minutes, reviewing in his mind detail after detail concerning the lives of these men, searching desperately for some way out of this, his tightest spot yet. Somehow, his eyes had returned, time and again, to the nickel in the glass on the table in front of him. That glass with which De Carlo had done his trick, and the nickel inside it, seemed to hold some solution to his tight spot. Then, quite suddenly he remembered that other glass with that other nickel in it … .\n\nDe Carlo, grinning again, started toward the man from the Dial.\n\n&quot;Hold it!” Andrews suddenly snapped.\n\nThe unexpected imperativeness of the reporter’s tone halted De Carlo. Sauchelli did no more than nod to De Carlo to continue to do a good job of knocking out the newsman. But Andrews’ next words stirred fiery, fierce interest in Joe Sauchelli’s eyes.\n\n&quot;Sauchelli — -you’d like to know who murdered your brother, wouldn’t you?” De Carlo fell back a pace and looked questioningly at Sauchelli, who said: &quot;You — better have something to say — or I’ll use a knife on you.”\n\nHis voice rose thinly, cruelly: &quot;I’ll — I’ll cut your damned heart out!”\n\nTight-spot Andrews pointed calmly to the nickel in the glass, saying: &quot;That glass with the nickel in it suddenly reminded me of another glass with a nickel in it — and that other was found in the room with your brother Luigi’s body.”\n\nSauchelli’s face was contorted with emotion, and he was speechless.\n\nDe Carlo said, &quot;Say, you tryin’ to — “ and stopped quite suddenly.\n\nFrank Adamo had now come away from his post at the entrance, and he was listening intently a few paces off.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA Glass With A Nickel Fallen Into It\n\nFinally Sauchelli snarled: &quot;Why, you damn punk, you can’t try to fool me. I searched every inch of that room, looking for something the fool cops mighta missed. There wasn’t no glass in the room with no nickel in it.”\n\nAndrews leaned forward, fixing Sauchelli with intent eyes, and said: &quot;The police removed the glass before you came. You see, they took some things down to headquarters for special fingerprinting other than what was done around the room.”\n\nJoe Sauchelli looked queerly at De Carlo.\n\n&quot;Joe, you don’t think I coulda — “ De Carlo gasped, and got no further as fear lumped his throat.\n\nAdamo came closer on catlike feet, a strange, tense look in his eyes.\n\n&quot;I know, De Carlo,” Andrews was saying, &quot;a thousand guys probably know that glass trick. However, who else did Luigi know that did that trick?”\n\nAndrews knew he was only shooting in the dark, and he waited tensely.\n\nDe Carlo paled at sight of Sauchelli’s blazing eyes, and gulped: “It’s this damn scribbler’s trick. Joe, that ain’t no proof — that ain’t no proof.”\n\n“You sure you wasn’t there, Tony?” Sauchelli asked, icily.\n\n“No, Joe, I wasn’t there — I wasn’t there.”\n\nAndrews noticed that Frank Adamo’s mouth was twitching more than usual; that the man’s face was drawn.\n\n“I know that ain’t no real proof,” Sauchelli said, thoughtfully, “but there’s a chance you were there that night — an’ not in Philly. Maybe you an’ Luigi had a fight over somethin&#39;. I dunno about the nickel in the glass, but maybe I oughta — Say, it seems to me that you were pretty sore that time my brother got a bigger cut on a job than you did.”\n\nTony De Carlo&#39;s face looked as if it would never smirk again, as he begged: “No — Joe, don’t give it to me just on a thing like that. I was there, Joe, but I never done it. I tell you what I saw … .”\n\nJoe Sauchelli’s eyes were filled with a deadly belief that he had found his brother’s murderer.\n\n“Put your hands on the table, Tony,” he said, coldly.\n\nDe Carlo’s trembling hands came up, away from Trauber’s and the doorman’s guns he had put in the side pockets of his coat.\n\n“Stalling now, eh, Tony?” Sauchelli said, sneering. “Gonna make up a story about somethin’, eh?”\n\n“Better hear what he’s got to say, Sauchelli, before you shoot,” Andrews advised.\n\nThe expression on Frank Adamo’s face was changing from tense anger to puzzlement, to anger again.\n\n“Yeah — listen, Joe,” De Carlo pleaded, “I went up to see Luigi — I got back from Philly ahead of time — an’ I see a guy come sneakin’ out of the apartment. So I duck into that dark corner of the hall, an’ I watch. He wipes his fingerprints off the knob of the front door an — “\n\nFrank Adamo stepped a pace nearer and interrupted with: “You don’t say, Tony. Did you see who he was?”\n\nDe Carlo looked up into Adamo’s eyes, which were fixed on him like those of a snake, and stammered: “No — no I didn&#39;t get a very good look at him. ... I got into the apartment through a window from the fire escape. I saw that Luigi was dead. I didn’t tell Joe because I didn’t want to get mixed up in any trouble with him not believin’ me — or somethin’.”\n\n“You are goin’ to tell me who that man was,” came Sauchelli’s icy tones. “I think you’re lyin’.”\n\nAndrews suddenly leaned forward and said: “I hinted at it before, when I asked De Carlo if Luigi knew anybody else, personally, who did the glass trick. Perhaps — ah, Adamo learned it from De Carlo. There was a glass in that room, a glass with a nickel fallen into it.”\n\nAdamo started forward, viciously. But Sauchelli stopped him with a significant movement of his automatic.\n\n“Tony,” said Sauchelli with deadly chill, “you’re acting too damned scared and yellow. Somebody killed Luigi for that big cut he got, and I know you were sore ‘cause he got so much more’n you.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nOut of Another Impossible Jam\n\nThe muzzle of Sauchelli’s gun rose a trifle, centering more perfectly on De Carlo’s heart.\n\nDe Carlo hesitated, then burst out: “I ain’t never ratted before, but you ain’t gonna give it to me for nothin’, Joe. I know who done it. Frank done it! He’s the guy I saw coming out of Luigi’s room.”\n\nFrank Adamo leaped to one side, catlike, hand clawing for his gun. Joe Sauchelli slipped to one knee from his chair and pulled trigger. Then the air was filled with the thunder of both men’s guns.\n\nTight-spot Andrews backed swiftly away from the table. De Carlo, caught between two fires, grabbed spasmodically at a shoulder when he was hit; then he slumped to the floor. The reporter saw Adamo stagger and fall, mouth gushing blood, after Sauchelli’s fourth shot. Desperately, the reporter launched his long body in a tackle at De Carlo.\n\nThe newshawk&#39;s shoulder hit the table, , and it skidded across the dance floor and crashed against a pillar. But Andrews&#39; outflung hands seized the wounded De Carlo, and the reporter pulled the racketeer&#39;s body up and over. Using it as a shield, he struggled to his feet.\n\nJoe Sauchelli&#39;s automatic spat — once, twice. Andrews felt the thudding impact of bullets tearing into De Carlo&#39;s big body. Then he hurled the weight from him, straight at Sauchelli.\n\nSauchelli went down under De Carlo&#39;s big body, and Andrews threw himself at both of them, fists flailing. Those fists were wasted on De Carlo, as Tight-spot found out afterwards, but one hefty swing put Sauehelli out for a good ten minutes — long enough for the Dial man to telephone the police and for them to arrive … .\n\nMuch later that morning, Tight-spot Andrews and Captain of Detectives, Bert James were drinking coffee and munching rolls in a dog wagon. Both were well pleased — although the captain was a bit irate because Andrews had been taking undue delight in holding out on him about the mystery of the glasses with the nickels in them.\n\nCaptain James growled: “Come on, sorehead, just because I haven’t had a chance to read your old newspaper story, why hold out on a fella?&quot;\n\nJohn Andrews smiled and explained: “When I went up to Luigi’s apartment with Lieutenant Doyle, it happened that neither he nor the boys with him had a nickel to feed the pay phone in the hall to get the corpse doc and the fingerprint crew. I was fumbling with my change, and I dropped one of my nickels in a glass that happened to be on a table. He wouldn’t let me fish it out for fear of disturbing any prints. I remember looking down at it and making a wisecrack about somebody getting graft. Somehow, at the Red Parrot, my memory kept asking me where I had ever before seen a glass with a nickel in the bottom of it. Foolish — but then I have a theory that similarities — &quot;\n\nThe captain broke in with: “All right, all right, John — just let it go that that great crackpot, Tight-spot Andrews, got out of another impossible jam.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n"

To the native mind &quot;Joss&quot; shone out glaringly from his face, in the deep smallpox pittings, in the flaring of the ears, and in the unbroken sweep of the eyebrows across the bridge of his nose. His face, his appearance, his furnishings, bespoke opulence, from his shell-rimmed spectacles, through his jade bracelets, to his red, plush-covered chairs on which he never sat. Ho Ling was a power, and his &quot;face&quot; was immense.\n\nHe was sitting on the k&#39;ang and luxuriating in the kitchen gases which passed through its interior. Thoughtfully he manipulated his water pipe. Thoughtfully he glanced at the vertical columns of the morning paper. With what might or might not have been indifference he read the little paragraph headed in sprawling characters. &quot;Plague Outbreak at Kwang Cheng-tzu.&quot; Solemnly he looked out through the central bit of glass in his shell-paned window.\n\nOutside, across the broad stretch of water-front, chopping a little as the west wind contended with the newly flooding tide, he saw the great, brown river. Struggling against the current was a lumber-raft. Bulky and low-lying it was, with its logs chafing at the withes that bound them. The three-hundred-mile journey from the nearest forests of the T&#39;ieh Ling had not improved its seaworthiness. Silhouetted against the river, its six rowers worked with a unison found in Greek friezes. A gust of wind struck the pane. Ho Ling, his southern nature recoiling, in spite of years of acclimatization, from the Manchurian cold, shivered. Then impassively, apparently aimlessly, he spoke.\n\n&quot;The river will freeze in two weeks more,&quot; he said.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Heavy Wood\n\nKwang Li, fat and prosperous, but whose attire in its bulginess of cotton padding bespoke the Third Estate, basked in the shelter of his lumber-yard&#39;s north wall and watched his coolies sweat at the long rip-saws. To him. his membership in the plutocracy proclaimed by shimmering satin and glistening fur, approached Ho Ling.\n\n&quot;Hao,&quot; remarked the owner, &quot;may health attend you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hao,&quot; replied Kwang Li. &quot;Will the precious guest avail himself of my mean hospitality.&quot;\n\nHo Ling bowed, and Kwang brewed a pot of tea from the steaming samovar in the yard comer. Silently the two men drank, and watched the mahogany-hued. half-naked coolies as they tugged at the saws and slowly reduced the logs to massive boards. The little puddles of water the compound bore a skiff of ice, and still Kwang Li&#39;s minions sweated until their head-cloths hung heavy, soaked.\n\nSuddenly Ho Ling became voluble. He spoke enthusiastically of the soya beans that he hoped to obtain through Kwang next spring. He suggested elaborate plans for getting out from the interior the coming silk crop—plans which only Kwang could carry out. He enlarged upon the possibilities and benefits—to Kwang—of the straw-mat trade in years to come. Then he veered to the talk of timber. Always agreeing, Kwang Li listened.\n\n&quot;A lumber-yard must eat you up in winter,&quot; he remarked.\n\n&quot;Everything is unprofitable here.&quot;\n\n&quot;I should think you would want to sell off—&quot;\n\n&quot;So. But I heard talk said that some one buys up all the lumber. If these be true words—&quot;\n\nKwang Li regarded a sparrow attentively as he stroked the long hairs of a cherished mole.\n\nInwardly Ho Ling cursed that uncanny Oriental intelligence system that conveys news, so much faster than word or wire. Outwardly no muscle of face or hand or body moved. Scornfully he went on: &quot;Living picture! What wild words! Now—&quot;\n\nThe contest was on. For half an hour it continued with spittings and revilings and contemptuous leavetakings. Suddenly they stopped; the inevitable compromise had been effected. They, sauntered slowly to Ho Ling&#39;s house, and a writer was told to draw up the contract. Waiting, they drank endless cups of tea and exchanged occasional monosyllables.\n\nThe shroff came with the contract. Ceremoniously they signed. Then Kwang Li spoke, with relief and curiosity fully apparent.\n\n&quot;But for what do you want all the heavy wood in town? It&#39;s not the season to build. For why?&quot;\n\n&quot;May Heaven drip death on you!&quot; reviled Ho Ling, become affable &quot;Who knows? I may buy a new woman and everything must glitter for them at first. Or maybe I want to make you a coffin, Master Kwang.&quot;\n\n&quot;You honor me excessively,&quot; said Kwang seriously.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nHigh-Born Lady of Kwang\n\nHo Ling sat in his patch of sunlit. Outside a tireless wind, sweeping from Gobi over the great southern plain, rattled his pebble-paved yard. Across the &quot;bund&quot; he watched the river, swirling its seven miles an hour at the behest of the tide, with the big, white ice-floes spinning like tops. All that was needed for the final sealing of the stream was slack water and the thermometer twenty below. Ho Ling&#39;s two weeks were up.\n\nHo Ling sunned himself, read the morning&#39;s paper, and toiled ceaselessly with his water-pipe. A minute&#39;s manipulation of tobacco, of tapers, and of heated skewers resulted in three gurgling puffs. A lengthy cleaning process, and the ceremony would begin again.\n\nAll the while Ho Ling&#39;s eyes—they were dull and glazed when at rest—wandered. From the pipe to the river, to the bund, to the door, they strayed. Now they lit on his warehouse door, and the look of inscrutability returned. But always his glance came back to the scrawly newspaper, with its vertical writing and its horizontal columns. Always his eyes lit up as he read of plague, plague, everywhere plague, at Harbin, at Kwang Cheng-tzu, at Liao Yang, at Mukden.\n\nAnd then the paper would be put down, the pipe taken up, and again the eyes would glaze. Ho Ling was waiting.\n\nThere was a scratch at the narrow door.\n\n&quot;Come!&quot; he called.\n\nThe wooden hinges creaked and a woman came through the door. Her shoulders were bowed, though her years were not more than twenty-two. Her clothing, cotton-padded, stiff with dirt, announced her class, while the Manchu headdress, over which her unkempt hair was stretched, told of her race. On her back she carried a child.\n\nHo Ling recognized Kwang Li&#39;s wife. In spite of her rank and her sex, he assumed his politest manner. All traces of expectancy seemed to vanish.\n\n&quot;Are you wanting anything, High-born Lady of Kwang?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t want anything, Venerable Ho, but since I&#39;m here, I&#39;d like to talk about those outside- country stoves you sell.&quot;\n\nThey chatted warmly for fifteen minutes, Kwang Lao Mu bargaining spiritedly for stoves, lamps, a phonograph, and a watch. It was Ho Ling who brought up the subject of coffins. At the mention Mrs. Kwang blinked openly. Then she plunged on.\n\n&quot;Yes, a coffin is always a fine thing to have. You know we have no need for one, but they always make handsome ornaments, there&#39;s no denying. We have an empty northwest corner in our house that a nicely varnished coffin would just fit. Could you make us—&quot;\n\n&quot;By extreme good luck, Mrs. Kwang, I happen to have several in my godown already made.&quot; He commenced a long speech on coffins, coffinmaking, and the general superiority of Ho Ling coffins over all others. Then he shot:\n\n&quot;But of course, Mrs. Kwang, you do not want to buy without first talking with your man. Why didn&#39;t he come this morning?&quot;\n\nKwang Lao Mu blinked again.\n\n&quot;The father of my Pao-tzu,&quot; she replied, &quot;has a little sickness this morning. A small, small cold.&quot;\n\n&quot;What a pityl What a sorrow! It isn&#39;t any more serious than that?&quot;\n\n&quot;No. Indeed no. He only coughs somewhat.&quot;\n\n&quot;He does not cough—blood?&quot;\n\nMrs. Kwang&#39;s eyes popped. He knew!\n\n&quot;What flock of crows or tortoises has told you,&quot; she cried. &quot;You have seen the mission doctor.&quot;\n\n&quot;Shih,&quot; confirmed Ho Ling. &quot;It is wen-ping, the plague.&quot;\n\nPao-tzu&#39;s mother clasped her hands for an instant. Then she demanded:\n\n&quot;How much?&quot;\n\n&quot;Thirty taels.&quot;\n\n&quot;Robber! Never was a coffin of that sort bought for more than fifteen. Have you no coffined forbears that you — Twenty.&quot;\n\n&quot;If the revered ancestress grudges the insignificant thirty taels, she can doubtless go to other merchants in the town and get coffins, inferior far to those bearing the Ho Ling chop, but cheaper.&quot;\n\nKwang Lao Mu surrendered. Ever since she had learned from the other timber merchants—she had made the rounds of them all—that Ho Ling had a monopoly, she had known herself to be in his power. The ground was frozen too hard to permit of burial before spring, and a coffin she must have. Slowly she nodded her head, and, fumbling in her coat, produced an ingot of silver as she said:\n\n&quot;This we were to eat this winter.&quot;\n\nBut Ho Ling did not hear her. With covetous eyes he looked at the heavy &quot;shoe,&quot; which he estimated to weigh at least forty taels, and, as he looked, thought of raising his price. But Ho Ling had a reputation to maintain. Never had he changed a price after it had once been agreed upon.\n\nResolutely he cast the temptation aside.\n\nInstead he called his shroff, and, in ordering the scales to weigh the shoe, secretly specified a pair in which weight and truth registered an equal minimum.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Mission Doctor\n\n&quot;The fat man\nOpened a shop.\nHe had no money.\nSo he pawned his trousers.&quot;\n\nMrs. Kwang was droning. In time with the uncouth rhythm she applied a coat of Ning-po varnish over the new coffin.\n\nIt was four o&#39;clock and already dark. A tiny oil-lamp cleared the night of the room into dusk. The somber walls were barely detectable by the projection upon them of Kwang Lao Mu&#39;s flickering shadow, itself of little darker hue. Only in the center of the room was there a true gleam, the dull sheen of the Ning-po varnish on the coffin.\n\nA current of cold air told Mrs. Kwang that the door was open. She looked up and saw on the sill Davis, the mission doctor. Broad of foot, broad of forehead, broad of shoulder, bulkily wrapped in an ungainly robe of white, he filled the whole low doorway.\n\n&quot;How&#39;s your man?&quot; asked Davis.\n\n&quot;Ai-i,&quot; wailed the woman. &quot;Dead! Ai-i—&quot; With a convulsive movement she tore off the heavy Manchu headdress. Bending to the floor she powdered dust on her unbound tresses, crooning the wail of the north, a wail not much unlike her previous song.\n\n&quot;Quit that!&quot; ordered Davis sharply. Kwang Lao Mu stopped.\n\nDavis pushed back the cowl of his robe and with one comprehensive glance examined the room. Through the gloom he made out the sheen of the varnish on the coffin, and came bluntly to the point.\n\n&quot;Why do you varnish it? This is no time for feng-shui, for geomancy. He must be buried at once.&quot;\n\n&quot;It is not feng-shui. Who are we to await lucky days? We are too poor to employ geomancers. Our dish is broken and the gruel leaked out.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then for why the varnish? You must bury him, and very quickly.&quot;\n\n&quot; We can&#39;t bury him. The ground is frozen hard. Now, in the spring—&quot;\n\n&quot;H-m,&quot; said Davis. &quot;Now there&#39;s hell to pay.&quot;\n\nFor a matter of thirty seconds he stood motionless, his heavy chin sunk on his chest. Then he produced a note-book and stubby pencil. With nervous decision he dashed off two lines, and called out. A lackey, one of four in his train, stepped gingerly over the door-sill.\n\n&quot;Take this chit to Standard Oil, to Mei foo,&quot; ordered David. &quot;Have those twenty carts of oil here by seven.&quot;\n\nThen he turned abruptly to the woman. &quot;The body must burn,&quot; he said curtly.\n\nThe vanish-stick subsided into the pot with a slithering splash as Lao Mu leaped to her feet.\n\n&quot;No!&quot; she cried. &quot;That cannot be. How can he join his ancestors, how can we worship him, when the only resting-place of his spirit is destroyed? I do not condemn his soul to a homeless sojourn and a beingless hereafter. No! Not that hua! Ai-i—&quot;\n\nDavis set himself shamelessly to manufacturing mythology:\n\n&quot;No tumult, woman! Listen. This sickness is not like other illness: It is caused by a demon, that is true enough. But these are no ordinary devils. These are the T&#39;u Kui. So evil are they that the very gods cannot bear their presence and have banished them away. Their punishment it is to be imprisoned in the body of a man forever. The man whom they afflict must die—it is the wen-ping. But, living or dead, they do not desert the body—unless the body be destroyed.&quot;\n\nDully the woman looked toward the coffin. &quot;These are not the words spoken at your church,&quot; she cast back at him. Davis hesitated.\n\nThere was a stir in the corner of the k&#39;ang. Pao-tzu uncoiled himself from his ragged cotton quilt and looked around uncertainly. Spying the burnish of the coffin&#39;s varnish, he laboriously crawled toward it. Kwang Lao Mu jumped toward him. With a stream of affectionate abuse, she rolled him back and tangled him in the quilt.\n\n&quot;It is death and worse!&quot; she cried. &quot;Lie still!&quot;\n\nDavis pressed the obvious advantage.\n\n&quot;Living or dead, it is the same. While the body, while the bones lie there, there stays the demon. Bad luck he brings and run, and while he stays the homeless spirit of Kwang Li flutters around in the great void, restless and alone. He blights the house where the body lies, he ruins the feng-shui of the burial plot. Only when the body is destroyed can the T&#39;u Kui go free and the spirit seek repose. Better no body at all than one desecrated by a devil. It must burn.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ai-i,&quot; groaned Mrs. Kwang. &quot;Ai-i.&quot; Burying her head in Pao-tzu&#39;s quilt, she quivered with hacking sobs.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Coffin Market\n\nLazily Ho Ling rubbed his eyes. With feline luxury he stretched himself until his joints cracked. Slowly he raised himself to a sitting position and reached for his water-pipe. Outside the sun had just shot up. With the trace of a self-satisfied smirk. Ho Ling looked through the little pane at his godown door Then his jaw dropped. There was no one there.\n\nHe heard a scratch at the door.\n\n&quot;Come!&quot; he called.\n\nThe door opened cautiously. Slowly, her head bowed, her hair disheveled, entered Mrs. Kwang. She was breathing hard.\n\nHo Ling resumed his affable politeness. &quot;Please be seated, Mrs. Kwang,&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;My thirty taels!&quot; she gasped, still standing.\n\nHo Ling blinked. &quot;What thirty taels?&quot;\n\n&quot;For the coffin. I don&#39;t need it. I want my thirty taels.&quot;\n\n&#39;Your man has recovered? Well, well!&quot;\n\n&quot;He died. Ai-i,&quot; she wailed appropriately.\n\n&quot;Hush, woman. Then why don&#39;t you need the coffin?&quot; Indecisively Ho Ling scratched his chin with the long, well-cared-for nail of a little finger.\n\n&quot;Because the body must be burned.&quot;\n\n&quot;Burned! But his ancestors, his child—My dear Mrs. Kwang—&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, burned. The outside-country pig ordered it. There he lay in the coffin, all in white—Ai-i,&quot; she began.\n\nHo Ling galvanized into action, his indecision and politeness gone.\n\n&quot;Hush, spawn!&quot; he cried. &quot;What a liver! What a gall! You put your man in the coffin. You use the coffin. You defile the coffin! And now you want to sell it back. Decayed tortoise-egg—go! Go back to your accursed coffin! May you need it soon!&quot;\n\nAs he spoke he hustled Kwang Lao Mu out of the door. At the threshold he gave her a final shove and slammed the leaves to. Then, with every shadow of emotion wiped off his face, he returned to the little window. The godown entrance was still deserted. He realized that it would stay deserted. The coffin market had slumped.\n\nSlowly he sat down on the k&#39;ang.\n\nAutomatically he reached for the water-pipe. Taking the red-hot skewer, he plunged it into the pinch of tobacco and methodically pulled thrice. The last puff was almost a sigh. Then he spoke:\n\n&quot;Tomorrow must come. There will be cholera with the rains.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n"

The report that came to me was that a man named Prescott Carroll had been arrested for the murder of Oliver Brundage — &#39;Ollie&#39; Brundage; you all know him.&quot;\n\nThe reporters nodded. The name and fame of Ollie Brundage were quite familiar to them. He was a young man of good family, a bachelor and clubman, who managed to move in the highest society without any visible means of support. They also knew Carroll, who had gone out of journalism into literature eight or ten years before, and had won a certain measure of recognition.\n\n&quot;The arrest was made by a patrolman and Detective Hines of my staff,&quot; continued the inspector. &quot;It seems that Carroll knocked Brundage down with a sand club or something of that kind, and was going through his pockets. It was on West Seventy-eighth\n\nStreet, just opposite the new church. The prisoner was taken to the station house, but I sent word to have him brought down here. Brundage&#39;s body is at the station now. That&#39;s all I know.&quot;\n\nThe reporters exchanged glances. Then one of them asked: &quot;What&#39;s this about a millionaire&#39;s pocketbook being found in Carroll&#39;s pocket?&quot;\n\n&quot;I heard a rumor to that effect,&quot; said the inspector, &quot;but I&#39;m not prepared to answer any questions.&quot;\n\n&quot;Isn&#39;t it a fact,&quot; queried one of the reporters, &quot;that there have been a good many holdups in the neighborhood, and that your man Hines was up there on that account?&quot;\n\n&quot;There have been some wild stories in the newspapers,&quot; the inspector began, but checked himself as he perceived a lieutenant entering by a door upon the left. The lieutenant executed a sort of military salute, and departed without having opened his mouth.\n\n&quot;You boys will have to get out of here now,&quot; said the inspector. &quot;I&#39;ll see you later.&quot;&#39;\n\nThe reporters filed out like so many pallbearers. Every one of them looked at his watch, though there was a clock in plain sight on the wall. It was half past one in the morning, and minutes were precious.\n\nNo one remained in the room except the chief and a man in a dark-gray suit who sat against the wall opposite the door where the lieutenant had appeared.\n\n&quot;You know him, Carter, don&#39;t you?&quot; asked the inspector.\n\n&quot;Three years ago,&quot; replied the detective, &quot;I knew him as a brilliant and promising fellow; but he passed out of my sight.&quot;\n\n&quot;Writer, eh? I&#39;ve read one of his stories. It was good, too. Why the devil should he have done this thing?&quot;\n\nCarter answered only with a gesture. The inspector glanced quickly toward the door; then, leaning forward in his chair, with his right elbow on the desk and his open hand against the side of his face, he waited in the shadow.\n\nThe brim of Carter&#39;s hat was nearly level with his eyes, and as the principal source of light was a cluster of lamps against the wall and almost directly over his head, his countenance was scarcely visible.\n\nThe door at the left swung open, and two officers appeared with the prisoner between them. They paused an instant, so that the man seemed to come alone into the white glare of light and the oppressive silence.\n\nHe was tall and of a strong frame, but excessively thin. He had wavy, dark-brown hair, a high forehead painfully wrinkled above the bridge of the nose; pale-blue eyes, with that faded look one sees in the eyes of tired women; a light mustache, and a well-molded but rather weak chin, with a dimple in it. He wore a shabby, black overcoat above what seemed to be expensive and fashionable evening dress.\n\nCarter, who remembered Prescott Carroll as he had been, was shocked at the change in him. He seemed to have lived a dozen years between twenty-nine and thirty-two.\n\nThere was a straight-backed wooden chair, which, standing alone in the middle of the big and bare room, had a singular effect of isolation. Carroll looked at it, perceived that it was for him, and sat down with a shudder.\n\nAt that moment Hines, the headquarters man who had assisted in the arrest, appeared at the door. The inspector beckoned to him, and he came forward; while Carter, crossing the room, whispered to one of the policemen who immediately went out.\n\n&quot;Well?&quot; said the inspector, addressing Hines.\n\n&quot;At ten minutes past twelve,&quot; responded the officer, &quot;I was going west along Seventy-eighth Street toward Berkeley Avenue. There is an apartment house on the southeast corner, with an alley behind it which runs halfway down the block and then turns to the avenue. There&#39;s an iron fence with a gate on each end.\n\n&quot;Close by this fence, where there isn&#39;t much light, I saw this man stooping over a body that lay on the sidewalk. I ran up, and at the same time Patrolman Bruce came from the direction of the avenue. We had the man between us, and when he saw that he surrendered. He seemed to be dazed, and we couldn&#39;t get him to say anything to us.\n\n&quot;I recognized the man on the ground as Oliver Brundage. He was alive then, but unconscious. He died before the ambulance came. There was no weapon. Brundage was killed by striking his head in falling. We had the body taken to the station house, and took this man there. He talked to himself on the way. He said, &#39;Don&#39;t worry; don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll be all right. It&#39;s the best thing that could have happened.&#39; He admitted having killed Brundage, but that is all we could get out of him.&quot;\n\nThe inspector turned to Carroll and asked him whether he had anything to say, warning him, in accordance with the law, that whatever he said could be used against him on the trial.\n\nHe remained silent for perhaps half a minute, during which interval Hines laid upon the inspector&#39;s desk a package containing all that had been taken from the prisoner when he was searched at the station house.\n\n&quot;Denial is useless,&#39;&#39; said Carroll at last. &quot;I was taken in the act.&quot;\n\nHis manner was indefinably strange. If one may attempt description, it was more like an invalid&#39;s than a criminal&#39;s. This man of cultured mind and delicately sensitive nature seemed to feel neither remorse nor shame. There was evidence of considerable anxiety, but this state was repeatedly interrupted by involuntary outbursts of reassurance, almost of satisfaction.\n\n&quot;What was your motive?&quot; asked the inspector.\n\n&quot;Robbery!&quot; replied the prisoner cheerfully. &quot;I was driven to it by poverty.&quot;\n\nThe inspector looked hastily at Carter, who returned the glance meaningly. Both men perceived that the prisoner&#39;s answer was a lie, and that it covered a mystery. This case which, on a casual view seemed so clear, being the arrest of a highway robber beside the body of his victim, became at once to these experienced men a problem for close and rigid investigation.\n\n&quot;I thought you were successful in your profession?&quot; said the inspector.\n\n&quot;I might have been,&quot; was the reply, &quot;but I had bad luck and many burdens. There were people dependent upon me. I never worry about myself. I suppose nobody does. It was about others.&quot;\n\nHe became excited as he spoke, and his self-control slipped away. It was obvious that he did not mean to tell his story, but that it told itself, just as the first words he had uttered in that room had overridden his will.\n\nIt appeared that he had been married five years before, and that his wife had almost immediately begun to lose her sight, as the result of a malady rare and little understood. Gradually, with that steady deliberation which nature commands, and human torturers vainly strive to imitate, the shadows had closed around her. Carroll had beggared himself with doctors; he had become a borrower under the pressure of a need that could not be postponed. His friends had turned from him, and some of them, for the sake of the spite that grows out of money, had raised up other enemies when their own power to injure him had seemed inadequate.\n\nMeanwhile, his strength had declined, and his imagination, too much occupied with images of his own increasing sorrow, had ceased to suggest the pictures which his art required. His earnings had decreased as his needs grew. He had labored under that enormous disadvantage of visible misfortune; he had become the lame wolf which the pack rends.\n\nThroughout the latter part of this wretched period his sister and his brother&#39;s widow with two children had been dependent upon him. His wife, at last, had gone to a private hospital where the charges&#39; were excessive and the benefits few.\n\nThe wonder was that the man had not gone mad, laboring with a brain so clogged with miserable thoughts. Yet he did not seem to be insane, though surely on the brink of it.\n\nNeither Carter nor the inspector interrupted Carroll&#39;s recital which he himself finally broke off with an exclamation of despair.\n\n&quot;You see I can&#39;t help telling this,&quot; he said; &quot;though, upon my soul, I did not mean to do it.&#39;&#39;\n\nThe inspector glanced at Carter, and touched his forehead, unperceived by Carroll. The detective made a negative sign.\n\n&quot;Let us see what we have here,&quot; said the inspector, opening the packet which Hines had brought.\n\nIt contained a few trifles separately wrapped up, because they were obviously the prisoner&#39;s, and the things that he was supposed to have taken from Brundage. The latter consisted of a handkerchief, some letters, a cigarette case, a cardcase, and several keys. Another handkerchief — a woman&#39;s — and small coin to the value of sixty-four cents were marked as having been found in Brundage&#39;s pockets by the police.\n\n&quot;Then you got no money at all?&quot; said the inspector.\n\n&quot;I got a pocketbook,&quot; replied Carroll, with hesitation.\n\n&quot;Do you mean to say that you got this from Brundage?&quot; demanded the inspector, holding up the wallet.\n\n&#39;&#39;Certainly,&quot; answered Carroll, but he did not meet the eye of the questioner.\n\n&quot;Do you know whose pocketbook it is?&quot;\n\n&quot;They told me at the station house,&quot; said Carroll faintly, &quot;that it was Stanton Ripley&#39;s.&quot;\n\nStanton Ripley was a young man about town, possessed of great wealth, and a barnful of wild oats. The pocketbook bore his initials, and the crest of his family in gold and enamel. It was a plain, light Russia leather book, of the sort that folds in the middle with one large compartment on each side. Carter received it from the chief&#39;s hand, and discovered that it contained three thousand and ten dollars — one one-thousand-dollar bill; four of five hundred dollars and two of five dollars, all new.\n\n&quot;They found this in the prisoner&#39;s coat-tail pocket,&quot; said the chief. &quot;Were you aware,&quot; he continued, addressing Carroll, &quot;that this was in Brundage&#39;s possession when you attacked him?&quot;\n\nCarroll pondered upon this question.\n\n&quot;I couldn&#39;t know that,&quot; he said at last, in a faint voice.\n\nCarter observed that he had taken hold of the sides of his chair, as if to keep from falling out of it, and that a bluish pallor had overspread his face.\n\n&quot;Is there anything I can do for you?&quot; asked the detective kindly.\n\n&quot;Could I have something to eat?&quot; said the prisoner, in an embarrassed tone. &quot;Of course, if it&#39;s too much trouble — &quot;\n\n&quot;I have already sent out for some supper for you,&quot; replied Carter, looking closely at him. &quot;It occurred to me that you might like it. I wonder it hasn&#39;t come before this.&quot;\n\nCarroll expressed his gratitude, and while he was doing so, a policeman entered with several packages. The detective drew up a small table, and set forth a bottle of milk and a loaf of bread, at sight of which the prisoner&#39;s eyes shone. Behind him the policeman was opening a box from which he took a steak and potatoes on a wooden plate, and a knife and fork. He held up the knife, and looked inquiringly at Carter, who nodded; and the utensils were laid upon the table.\n\nThe prisoner ate well. Many times he spoke aloud in praise of the food, clearly not meaning to do so, for he always checked himself with shame.\n\n&quot;Now,&quot; he said at last, &quot;I feel first rate. Heavens!&quot;\n\nThe exclamation came suddenly. Carroll half rose, and then sank back. He passed his hand across his forehead which had become wet in an instant.\n\n&quot;My wife and my sisters!&quot; he cried. &quot;How shall I tell them?&quot;\n\n&quot;I am afraid that the newspapers will anticipate you, unless you telegraph,&quot; said Carter.\n\nHe took a pad of blanks and a pencil from the inspector&#39;s desk, and laid them before Carroll, who, after many attempts, wrote this message:\n\nBe prepared for very bad news; yet all for the best. Don&#39;t try to understand. Don&#39;t come here. Will send money.\n\nHe puzzled a long time over the last sentence, but finally let it stand. The message was addressed to his sister, Miss Hilda Carroll, in a small town in Massachusetts. At the bottom he wrote a request to repeat the-telegram to his wife, in care of the physician in charge of the hospital where she then was.\n\nCarter gave the telegram, with money for its transmission, to one of the policemen who went out with it immediately. The inspector, meanwhile, was answering a call upon the telephone that stood on his desk. He received a long report, at the close of which he ordered that the prisoner should be taken into an adjoining room.\n\n&quot;Nick,&quot; he said, as soon as they were alone, &quot;I&#39;ve just got word from the man who was sent to Ripley&#39;s rooms when the pocketbook was found upon Carroll. Ripley has just come home with, a bad wound in the head. He seems to have been wandering around the streets, dazed, for quite a long time. He was at his club until about eleven o&#39;clock, when he started out for a walk. On Fifth Avenue, alongside the park, about Sixty-third Street, he saw a man step out from behind a tree. As he turned to face the fellow, he got a rap on the left side of the head, and the next thing he remembers, he was on the other side of the park way up by Eighty-first Street, and it was more than two hours later.\n\n&quot;Where he had been in the meantime he doesn&#39;t know. His pocketbook was gone, and his watch. Nothing else was taken. He says he probably could not identify his assailant, though the man looked familiar. He knew Carroll very well; they were in college together. He lent him some money, a year or more ago; then they had a falling-out, and he hasn&#39;t seen Carroll since. He doesn&#39;t think it was Carroll who assaulted him. What do you make out of this?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, it seems somewhat extraordinary,&quot; said the detective, &quot;that a man on the verge of starvation should not have used one of those five-dollar bills to buy a meal. It occurs to me that we haven&#39;t found Ripley&#39;s watch; and I am also puzzled to know why a man who had made a haul of three thousand dollars should take the desperate chance of assaulting Brundage, who is well known never to have any money.&quot;\n\n&quot;Perhaps Carroll didn&#39;t know him,&quot; suggested the inspector.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s as bad one way as another,&quot; replied the detective. &quot;He wouldn&#39;t have risked three thousand dollars and his liberty on the chance of what might be in a stranger&#39;s pockets. However, we might ask him about it.&quot;\n\nCarroll was brought back into the room, and was informed of what had been learned about Ripley. He made a strong effort to cover his emotions, but Carter was of the opinion that, for some mysterious reason, the prisoner was not only surprised but pleased.\n\n&quot;It is true,&quot; he said. &quot;I did not take the pocketbook from Brundage. I took it from Ripley.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where?&quot; demanded the inspector, who had not mentioned the place designated by Ripley.\n\n&quot;In Central Park,&quot; was the reply. &quot;I followed him from his club.&quot;\n\nAt this point the prisoner showed his first disinclination to answer questions; yet he consented to hear a few from Carter, and this exchange resulted: &quot;Were you acquainted with Brundage?&quot;\n\n&quot;I knew him by sight and by reputation.&quot;\n\n&quot;When did you first see him this evening?&quot;\n\n&quot;When he turned out of the avenue into Seventy-eighth Street.&quot;\n\n&quot;Did you recognize him?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot;\n\n&quot;Did you speak to him before attacking him?&quot;\n\n&quot;No.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where did you get that dress suit?&quot;\n\n&quot;Ripley gave it to me, a year and a half ago, when he got me to go to a dinner at a club.&quot;\n\n&quot;Do you mean that he bought it for you?&quot;\n\n&quot;No; it was his. He had just had it made. It was one of his freaks to give it to me.&quot;\n\n&quot;What is that stain?&quot;\n\nIt was a reddish mark as if from a blow with a rusty iron bar, and it extended across the back of the overcoat about the waistline. The garment was lying on a chair. Carroll looked at the stain with mild surprise, and said he did not know what it was.\n\n&quot;Your dress coat was torn in the struggle with Brundage, I suppose,&quot; said the detective, indicating a ripped seam at the back of the left shoulder, and some further damage, here and there.\n\nCarroll nodded.\n\n&quot;You had your overcoat on when you were arrested, didn&#39;t you?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes; I just slipped it on, after the — the struggle.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why didn&#39;t you run through the alley when you saw the policemen coming?&quot;\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t know there was any gate in the fence,&quot; replied the prisoner.\n\nThis closed the examination, and Carroll was consigned to a cell.\n\n&quot;It is a singular coincidence,&quot; said the detective, &quot;that I happen to be very familiar with the spot where this arrest was made. I waited there some hours, on a recent evening. The gate in the fence could not be overlooked by any one, and just within it there is a rusty iron bar extending from the gatepost to the side of the house. From the appearance of the mark on Carroll&#39;s coat I should say that he had leaned against that bar. I came very near doing it myself. So Carroll had a neat way of escape, and did not take it.&quot; The inspector drummed with his fingers upon his desk, and gently whistled a little tune.\n\n&quot;For a case that opens with a confession,&quot; said he, at last, &quot;this is a beautiful muddle. To begin with, the man is such a purposeless liar — &quot;\n\n&quot;I would hardly say that,&quot; rejoined Carter. &quot;He knows what he is about. A liar he certainly is — one of the most perverse and incalculable that I ever encountered — but his statements help to clear the view. Obviously, he is willing to say anything which will tend to show that he attacked Brundage for the purpose of robbing him.\n\n&quot;Now, of course this crime was not robbery, though Carroll tried to give that color to it, and on a hasty inspiration, too, or he would not have committed the absurdity of taking the man&#39;s handkerchief, to say nothing about this rubbish of cigarette and cardcases.&quot;\n\n&quot;You mean that he killed Brundage for some other reason?&quot; asked the inspector.\n\n&quot;Did you observe the weather?&quot; rejoined Carter, with a smile. &quot;It has been snowing a little, and the pavements are a mess. Carroll&#39;s coat shows a considerable struggle, and by all the evidence, the two men must have fallen to the ground, one gripping the other&#39;s throat. It was then that Brundage&#39;s head struck the projection of the iron fence, but the assailant could not immediately have known the result. Without doubt, they rolled there together in the dirt. Yet there isn&#39;t a mark on Carroll&#39;s knees.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s so, but the elbow and left sleeve of his coat are soiled: not the overcoat; he&#39;d taken that off.&quot;\n\n&quot;It is all very singular,&quot; said the detective. &quot;I am being gradually led toward a remarkable conclusion; but I am not ready to talk about it yet. I suggest that we put the whole thing off till tomorrow.&quot;\n\n&quot;The case is in your hands,&quot; said the inspector, &quot;if you will be kind enough to take charge of it.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Mysterious Highwayman\n\nOn the following day the detective called upon Stanton Ripley at his rooms, which have sometimes been mentioned in print as the most luxurious bachelor apartments in New York. Ripley was under a doctor&#39;s care, but had almost ceased to require it. He had a contusion on the left side of his head behind the ear; but was suffering principally from mental strain, the result of his adventure of the previous night.\n\nIt was necessary to avoid exciting him, and the detective proceeded with the utmost caution. Ripley declared positively that his assailant was not Carroll; and after an hour of shrewd questioning, he admitted his belief that it was Brundage. Then he seemed to regret having made the statement, and he concluded by asserting his ignorance of the highwayman&#39;s identity.\n\nIt became necessary, therefore, to trace Brundage&#39;s movements on the previous evening, and this proved to be easy. From nine o&#39;clock until a few minutes before his death, Brundage had been in the apartments of a young widow, a Mrs. Haskell, who lived with her mother and sister in that building on Berkeley Avenue, behind which ran the alley that has been referred to. There had been three other guests, a man and two women, and Brundage had put them into a cab just before going to meet his fate. It had undoubtedly been his intention to walk across to his home, which was on Central Park, West.\n\nThis negatived any idea that Carroll could have found Ripley&#39;s pocketbook in Brundage&#39;s pocket. But where had he obtained it, since Ripley was sure that he was not the robber? And what motive could have induced Carroll to play his singular part in this affair?\n\nA study of the locality could not fail to raise the presumption that Carroll had been lying in wait for Brundage. The spot was well chosen. Yet Carroll was unknown to the Haskells, and could hardly have had any means of knowing where Brundage would spend the evening. Indeed, all the evidence that Carter could collect seemed to show that Carroll and Brundage had no common interest, and no possible ground for animosity.\n\nThere were rumors of ill feeling between Ripley and Brundage on account of the fascinating Mrs. Haskell, at whose home both were frequent visitors; but even upon the wild supposition that Ripley had been sufficiently jealous to employ Carroll as his bravo, he would hardly have paid him with his watch and pocketbook. Nor would Carroll have collected his price with the aid of a sand club.\n\nThe newspapers saw in Carroll a mysterious highwayman. They exaggerated one or two small robberies in the neighborhood into a great list of desperate crimes, and the young author was pictured as one of the famous degenerates of the age. But the real puzzles of the case remained unanswered. Nobody could account for Carroll&#39;s retention of that pocketbook; for his senseless risk in attacking Brundage while carrying so great a plunder from another crime; for his failure to take an easy chance of escape.\n\nIn the evening, Carter called at headquarters; and found Carroll&#39;s sister, his sister-in-law, and the latter&#39;s two children. The women had come to the city with a vague idea that their presence was required, and without enough money to take them back again. They and the children were in tears, and the scene was intensely distressing. It became positively harrowing when the inspector yielded to their entreaties, and summoned the prisoner from his cell.\n\nSomewhat to Carter&#39;s surprise, the man was greatly improved in appearance. His bearing was marked by a sad serenity. He beheld the tears and accepted the reproaches of the women with perfect composure, and it was only when they spoke of their immediate need of money that he showed any considerable anxiety. He referred them to a lawyer whom he had retained during the day, saying that he would probably assist them. Otherwise he said nothing to them except vaguely reassuring words; and though they said that they would come again on the following day — a suggestion which the inspector did not see fit to contradict — Carroll bade them farewell with an air of finality.\n\nWhen the prisoner had been removed, Carter inquired about his lawyer, and learned that a corporation attorney, practically unknown in criminal courts, had been retained. Carroll had given the name and address, and the attorney had been summoned.\n\n&quot;To the best of my judgment,&quot; said the inspector, &quot;he had never seen the prisoner before. Carroll was arraigned, and waived examination — as you know, of course.&quot;\n\nDuring the evening, Carter obtained a bit of evidence not altogether unimportant. It appeared that when Ripley left his club on the night of the crime, a man answering Carroll&#39;s description, who had been loitering for more than an hour in the neighborhood, had followed him. Two cabmen were the witnesses on this point, and they were perfectly confident; but they said that Ripley had gone up Fifty-ninth Street, instead of Fifth Avenue. Carter called upon Ripley in regard to this contradiction, and was informed that the young man had walked a little way up Fifty-ninth Street, but had returned. He had not seen Carroll following him.\n\nAbout noon the next day Carter called upon the inspector, who began conversation by stating that he had been devoting a good deal of thought to the Brundage case.\n\n&quot;And you have evolved a theory,&quot; said the detective, with a smile. &quot;Shall I tell you what it is?&quot;\n\nThe inspector shut one eye and scrutinized Carter closely out of the other.\n\n&quot;Go ahead, confound you!&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;ll tell me what it is, and then you&#39;ll show me why it isn&#39;t good for anything.&quot;\n\n&quot;On the contrary,&quot; replied the detective, &quot;it is very near the truth. In fact, there can hardly be two theories of this affair. I happen to know that one of your men compared the stain on Carroll&#39;s overcoat with the iron bar I spoke of — as to height from the ground, general appearance, et cetera. The conclusion that Carroll knew about the gate, and the way of escape through the alley is thus verified. Why didn&#39;t he run? The obvious explanation is that he remained to cover the retreat of some one else.&quot;\n\n&quot;Precisely,&quot; said the inspector. &quot;If the snow hadn&#39;t melted so soon we would have found tracks.&quot;\n\n&quot;You believe,&quot; continued Carter, &quot;that this young man, in his half-crazy desperation, had formed an alliance with some thug; that it was the thug who attacked Ripley; that the ease with which Ripley was disposed of, sent them both upon a mad career of depredation, with the intent of doing one big night&#39;s work and then quitting the town.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, something of that sort,&quot; admitted the inspector.\n\n&quot;Then it is the pal who has engaged this lawyer, and has supplied Carroll&#39;s relatives with money — &quot;\n\n&quot;Have they got some?&quot;\n\n&quot;Plenty,&quot; replied the detective, &quot;and they have gone back to Massachusetts. And I can tell you something more agreeable. Two of the leading medical experts of this city have &#39;taken an interest&#39; in Mrs. Carroll — who, by the way, is a very charming woman, whose needs, but never her importunities, have burdened our friend, for she is different from the others.&quot;\n\n&quot;You have seen her?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes; this forenoon. She does not yet know of her husband&#39;s misfortune. It was deemed unwise to tell her. But — would you believe it? — those experts who were so much interested by the accounts of her case published yesterday in connection with this affair, tell me that she has a good chance of recovery; that the treatment hitherto has been all wrong, and that she may fully regain her sight.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad of that,&quot; said the inspector.\n\n&quot;The experts are great men,&quot; said Carter, &quot;but they are not philanthropists; they are sure of their money. By the way, have you seen Carroll today?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, and the change in him is wonderful. Upon my word, he has gained pounds of flesh, and he looks positively handsome.&quot;\n\n&quot;His mind is relieved,&quot; responded Carter. &quot;You remember that he never worries about himself. That is the truest word he spoke to us. Worry for others has driven him half crazy — money worry — and now that it is over, he sees the electric chair before him, and is cheerful.\n\n&quot;I was near forgetting,&quot; he continued, after a brief pause, &quot;that I have recovered Ripley&#39;s watch. Some of my men searched the west side of the park from Seventy-seventh street northward, this morning, and they found it where some one had thrown it over the wall. A portrait on the inside of the case, at the back, has been scratched with a knife; but the job was done in the dark, and the face is still recognizable. It was Mrs. Haskell&#39;s.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why in blazes — &quot;\n\n&quot;My friend, it is as clear as a bell. Match it with my discovery that Carroll&#39;s coat showed every mark of the fight with Brundage, in which, singularly enough, his nether garments seem not to have shared.&quot;\n\n&quot;Do you mean that he changed coats with the real assailant?&quot; gasped the inspector.\n\n&quot;Beyond a doubt.&quot;\n\nThe inspector sprang up and seized his hat from the rack on the wall.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s go down to the Tombs,&quot; he said. &quot;Carroll is there.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Tombs\n\nIn a private room of the famous prison — the prisoner in the Brundage murder case, led from his cell he knew not why, found the inspector and the detective waiting for him.\n\n&quot;Mr. Carroll,&quot; said Carter kindly, &quot;the cat is out of the bag.&quot;\n\nThe prisoner started violently, and his face flushed.\n\n&quot;You were in desperate straits,&quot; the detective continued; &quot;you knew not where to turn for help. You had quarreled with Ripley, who once had befriended you, and yet, in your emergency you could think of no one else. You dressed as well as you could, in the suit that he had given you, and yet when you came to the club, your shabby overcoat kept you from asking for the man you wished to see. When he came out, you followed him, hesitating to speak. For miles along the streets, in the winter night, you kept him in sight, while he, with a foolish burden of jealousy on his mind, did not see you.\n\n&quot;At the corner of Berkeley Avenue and Seventy-eighth Street, he stopped. Presently he turned back, and you stepped within the iron gate to let him pass. Then Brundage appeared. Before you realized what was happening, the sharp struggle was over. Ripley had gratified his jealousy far more fully than he had planned to do. Brundage lay dead on the sidewalk, and Ripley, bending over him, groaned in agony.\n\n&quot;A sudden, grotesque, and terrible thought leaped into your mind — to exchange burdens with Ripley, to take his deadly sin, and give him your care, that would rest so lightly upon this Crœsus. With what insane relief he accepted your offer; what promises he made in those few thrilling moments, we can readily imagine.\n\n&quot;He had taken off his overcoat that he might be the more free to punish his rival. His clothes showed the struggle. As your two suits were identical, the change of coats was a natural suggestion. The purse with the money was forgotten; but Ripley, after he had escaped through the alley, remembered it, and his story of robbery was the only invention that could meet the situation. The rest comes naturally, including your queer lawyer whom Ripley recommended.&quot;\n\n&quot;Curse you!&quot; cried Carroll, leaping to his feet. &quot;You have ruined me.&quot;\n\n&quot;In return, let me promise my help,&quot; said Carter. &quot;I pity you, driven mad by care as you have been. There is no reason in the world why you cannot bear your burdens when you have had rest, with an easy mind. I can promise it to you.&quot;\n\nCarroll sank back into a chair, and began to weep hysterically.\n\nThe inspector viewed him with professional self-control, yet with some signs of sympathy.\n\n&quot;Shall I send a man for Ripley?&quot; he whispered.\n\n&quot;I have attended to that,&quot; responded the detective. &quot;He is on his way to headquarters by this time.&quot;\n\n&quot;Manslaughter, I suppose,&quot; muttered the inspector. &quot;I&#39;ll bet a hat that he doesn&#39;t get over five years.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n"

It has a bearing on that antagonism—which we&#39;ve just seen instanced—that exists between the artistic and the business mind.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, I think so,&quot; said the surgeon, consulting his watch. &quot;I had arranged to see a titled lady with nothing the matter with her. My assistant will be equal to the job though.&quot;\n\n***\n\nI don&#39;t know whether you&#39;ve ever been to Polford-on-Sea, said Hawke. You&#39;ve missed something if you haven&#39;t. There are rugged headlands, sweeping bays, and silent, glassy inlets. The downs are a cool green, and the cliff faces show a rich colouring.\n\nA sculptor fellow named Charles Whitley lived in a bungalow at the back of the town. Just such a chap as that one who was thrown out, you know. The very antithesis of the man who was allowed to remain.\n\nWhitley hated everybody in Polford because they thought only in terms of rent. To his eye they all seemed to be little-minded people preoccupied with the problem of earning a living or building up a fortune; hedged about with fears and prejudices of their own making; respecters of persons, mouthers of catch-phrases and second-hand ideas, believers one and all in the virtue and power of wealth.\n\nYes, exactly, my dear Mottram. Like the pompous one at the bar, to whom the club secretary grovelled. Whitley saw them all like that.\n\nAll, that is, except two.\n\nThere was a girl named Christine Collard, daughter of a Polford boardinghouse-keeper, a foolish little hussy, who, nevertheless, persuaded him that she was of his way of thinking.\n\nWhitley and Christine became engaged, though the prospect of marriage seemed rather remote.\n\nWhitley, you see, was not only penniless, apart from the small annuity on which he managed to exist, but regarded it beneath him as an artist to try to earn a living.\n\nHe had ideas of personal freedom which suited the irresponsible and flirtatious Miss Collard, who met many interesting visitors at the boardinghouse.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Kindred Spirit\n\nThe only other person for whom Whitley had any use was actually not so much a person as a myth. He was a gentleman constantly referred to by Whitley as Beaky Binks.\n\nWhitley had not met him for some years—not since student days, in fact. They had been close pals, held together by the artistic bond. Both shone in the art classes. They had criticised each other&#39;s work, and brawled in defence of each other&#39;s ideals.\n\nIn general it appeared, from what Whitley was constantly telling Christine, that he and Beaky Binks had stood back to back to defy all the meaningless trappings of priggery that beset one in the vulgar workaday world.\n\nSince those days Whitley had never met anyone like Binks.\n\nEveryone he had encountered since art school days had outraged his sensitive soul.\n\n&quot;They&#39;re only half-alive,&quot; he&#39;d say to Christine. &quot;They smile politely, and they talk and talk, without ever meaning a damn thing. They&#39;re afraid to breathe the air for fear it might be the property of the squire, or some limited liability company. They treat the sky and the sea and the landscape as though it were a man-made park, with keep off the grass &#39; warnings. And they like parks, by the way, better than natural scenery. They can&#39;t see any scenery until it&#39;s got a spiked fence round it and a bandstand in the middle of it.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s the way he talked to Christine. She approved, and he deceived himself that she understood.\n\nThen he&#39;d tell her about Beaky Binks.\n\n&quot;If only we could meet up with old Beaky,&quot; he&#39;d say. &quot;A real vital sort of fellow, Christine. Someone you can talk to about things.&quot;\n\nIt was apparent, even to Christine, that Whitley had idealised his old friend, and might be disappointed if they ever did meet again.\n\nHe refused to accept the argument that adulthood could in any way have altered Beaky, except—if such were possible—in the way of effecting an improvement.\n\n&quot;He wouldn&#39;t have deteriorated,&quot; Whitley declared. &quot;Not Beaky. The world wouldn&#39;t have got him down— wouldn&#39;t have turned him into a dried vegetable. He&#39;d have resisted its oppressive influence—would have fought back at it tooth and nail. He was a born fighter for honesty and freedom, was Beaky.&quot;\n\nChristine had a gift of listening, and she allowed him to prattle on. When she got bored with his company there was usually some diversion to be got from the holidaymaking men-boarders at her mother&#39;s private hotel.\n\nThey hadn&#39;t Whitley&#39;s hypnotic presence nor his dazzling conversation, but they usually had money, and Christine was not averse to expensive amusement.\n\nOne of the summer boarders was a Mr. Smith, a gentleman of considerably more wealth than any of the other boarders.\n\nChristine was the attraction. Otherwise he would have stayed in a first-class hotel.\n\nHe took Christine about in his flash car, and they attended dances and music hall shows together.\n\nSmith was exactly like that man over at the bar there (Hawke continued). Cocksure and abysmally ignorant.\n\nHis conversations were dreadfully dull, being a mixture of witless jokes in bad taste, maudlin sentiment, and hypocritical aspirations.\n\nEven Christine seems to have been revolted by his behaviour, for she told Whitley about his tipsy attempts at love-making. He had great mauling hands, and she shivered at his touch.\n\nWhitley was merely bored by her account of Smith. He dismissed him with a wave of his hand. He had not met Smith, and had no wish to. Such a vulgarian was so utterly beneath his consideration.\n\nNow we come to the drama.\n\nOne Friday night about half-past nine, Smith was found dead in a shallow, rocky pool at the foot of the East-over Cliff, having apparently fallen over the precipice.\n\nWhen the body was examined at the mortuary, however, convincing evidence was found that death had been due to strangulation.\n\nScotland Yard was called in, and, as I happened to be going that way on business, my friend, Detective-Inspector Gray, prevailed upon me to drive him down there.\n\nI took Tommy with me—Tommy Burke, you know, my assistant—and we stayed at the Collards&#39; boardinghouse.\n\nInspector Gray made inquiries about Smith&#39;s associates, and he discovered a possible motive for the crime which caused him to fasten his suspicions on Whitley, the sculptor.\n\nGray went to work on the jealousy motive, and he found Whitley quite a likely-looking murderer. He was a tall, powerful young man, quite capable of having strangled Smith.\n\nHis reaction to Gray&#39;s questions was startling. He promptly confessed to the murder, and gave elaborate details of how he had performed it.\n\n&quot;I picked him up by the scruff of the neck and the seat of the pants,&quot; he said, &quot;and I threw him over, with one labour-saving movement.&quot;\n\nGray thought these remarks a little odd, and went on to ask him why he did it.\n\n&quot;He wore squeaky brown boots,&quot; said Whitley. &quot;He consumed whelks in public, and committed the foul and dastardly crime of informing me that it was &quot;—Whitley gulped with emotion —&quot;that it was a—a nice day!&quot;\n\nAt this point it began to dawn on Gray that the confession was a hoax, and he then found himself in the odd position of trying to establish the suspect&#39;s innocence while the suspect himself was vociferously and cunningly seeking to prove himself guilty.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Question of Time\n\nOne fact emerged which caused Gray to give a policeman-like grunt of disgust and turn his back on Whitley.\n\nThat fact was an alibi to which there were a dozen independent witnesses. You see, Smith&#39;s wristwatch had been smashed in the fall, and it had stopped at half-past eight. That the watch had been correct was vouched for by a local jeweller, who had supplied it to him that very afternoon.\n\nWell, between ten past eight and ten past nine Whitley had been in the saloon bar of a local pub, discoursing on politics with a crowd of men who knew him well, and amongst whom he was immensely popular.\n\nHe couldn&#39;t have been in that bar and up on the top of the Eastover Cliff at one and the same time, so it seemed necessary to begin looking elsewhere for suspects.\n\nPoor Gray! Whenever he asks me to co-operate with him, I always get away with a lot of kudos to which I&#39;m not really entitled.\n\nThat&#39;s the whole point, Mottram. I wait until I&#39;m asked, and he doesn&#39;t ask me until he&#39;s done all the spadework himself.\n\nAs usual, I started where he left off, and made a thorough examination of Smith&#39;s belongings.\n\nThey included a small and obviously expensive reflex camera on which three exposures had been made.\n\nAt the boarding house they happened to know the name of a chemist to whom Smith had gone for his supplies, and I took the camera along to this man, who was able to identify both the camera and the film, which he himself had inserted.\n\nHe had torn the paper backing slightly, and that provided the identification. He had fitted the film on the Friday afternoon, only a few hours before Smith&#39;s death.\n\nHe developed the film and made some prints.\n\nAt first these seemed to offer no clue whatever. The only thing they proved was that the late Mr. Smith was an exceptionally fine landscape photographer. The choice of subjects, the composition, and the angle of view were perfect.\n\nThe last of the three pictures, in fact, would have won a prize at an exhibition. It was taken from the Eastover Cliff, and showed the headland across the bay, with the sun, a big red disc, sufficiently dull for the film to take clearly, just touching the horizon.\n\nYou see the significance of that, of course? The sun established the time when the photograph was taken, and that time was not half-past eight, but half-past nine.\n\nSmith had taken a photograph one hour after he was supposed to have been killed!\n\nThe immediate inference was that the murderer, in order to establish an alibi, had set his victim&#39;s watch back an hour—after killing him—smashed the glass to stop it, and then pitched the body over the cliff.\n\nThat part of the cliff-top is well concealed from view&#39;, and the inlet below was sealed by the ebbing tide, so that there were no people on the beach.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n&quot;I Killed Him All Right.&quot;\n\nIt was late in the evening when I had reached this stage in the inquiry (said Hawke), and I got Tommy to drive me to the Eastover Cliff.\n\nLeaving him in the car at the end of the beach road below, I walked up the cliff path, which is not designed for vehicles, and, arriving at the spot from where the body would have been pitched, I made a minute examination of the ground.\n\nIt was gravelly and grassy in patches, and things did not look too hopeful at first, but I was helped by the glint of the setting sun on some tiny fragments of glass.\n\nWith the aid of a pocket-lens I had assured myself that these were pieces of watch-glass, when I noticed a large, smooth pebble close by.\n\nOne side of the pebble was damp, with a film of soft clay adhering to it, and it clearly showed fingerprints.\n\nThe lens showed sufficient crystals of powdered glass sticking to one edge of the stone as to establish it as the stone with which the watch-glass had been smashed.\n\nThose finger-prints therefore constituted a valuable clue.\n\nI stood up to get an envelope from my pocket, in which to put the powdered glass and the pebble, and found myself standing face to face with Whitley.\n\nI met his eye, and got the impression that he was looking right through me.\n\n&quot;Mr. Hawke,&quot; he said, &quot;I think I begin to see how hopeless is the criminal&#39;s position in face of the recondite yet ruthlessly-methodical workings of your mind.\n\n&quot;Tell me,&quot; he went on, in ordinary conversational tones, &quot;what gave you the idea of searching for evidence of a smashed wrist-watch?&quot;\n\nI showed him the photograph of the setting sun, and explained how it had served to indicate that Smith had been alive at a later hour than his watch suggested.\n\n&quot;Beautiful,&quot; he said, and I don&#39;t quite know whether he was alluding to my reasoning or the picture.\n\n&quot;It certainly is a good picture,&quot; I said.\n\n&quot;Photography,&quot; he said disdainfully. &quot;I suppose up to a point the camera can express soul as well as a mallet and chisel, or a paintbrush. But the method is mechanical, and unworthy of the true artist.&quot;\n\nI then informed him that he was not obliged to make any statement to me about the crime, and advised him to say nothing, but he only laughed, and in the most matter-of-fact tones confessed his guilt.\n\n&quot;Oh, I killed him all right. It wasn&#39;t jealousy exactly, but I didn&#39;t see why a horrible, crawling mess like that should come along and rob me of my only real companion.&quot;\n\nHe then went off at a tangent again, his remarks becoming incoherent at times. I grew uneasy about him.\n\nWhen he walked down the slope towards the cliff edge, I suddenly realised his purpose in visiting the spot.\n\n&quot;Here,&quot; I shouted, &quot;come back.&quot;\n\nFrom the purely logical point of view there was no reason why I shouldn&#39;t have stood aside and allowed him to throw himself over, but human instinct was against allowing another to commit self-destruction, and I rushed after him and grabbed his arm.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Life-Saving Rugs\n\nIt&#39;s difficult (Hawke went on) to convey the intense, heart-gripping horror I felt at finding myself on the edge of eternity.\n\nYou&#39;ve never stood on the edge of a precipice, Mottram? Not right on the edge. One doesn&#39;t. Within a few inches of it, perhaps, and certainly with the whole of one&#39;s feet on the ground.\n\nBut I suddenly found myself with only my heels dug in and the soles of my feet projecting over into space.\n\nWhitley was actually leaning over, remaining poised there only by reason of my hold on his arm.\n\nI looked down between my feet, and saw a thin white thread of foam in the inlet below.\n\nA sailing boat imprinted itself on my vision. It appeared the size of a pea-pod.\n\nThere was a drop, I suppose, of nearly three hundred feet sheer.\n\nI daren&#39;t move to take a pace back. I just remained there, rigid, horrified and impotent.\n\nWhitley shouted at me and tugged on my right hand, and, as I fell, I twisted over instinctively, the way a cat does, and flung out my left arm.\n\nI clutched something very little more substantial than straw—a small root of some kind—and hung on.\n\nWhitley&#39;s entire weight was now swinging on my hand, and my legs were kicking free in the air. I was quite ready to let him go, but it was he who was hanging on. He had conceived the notion to take me with him.\n\n&quot;Come on, Hawke!&quot; he bellowed. &quot;Violent death is the only destiny for real men.&quot;\n\nI heard a loud roaring a short distance away, and it was more with a feeling of despair than of hope that I saw my car with Tommy at the wheel suddenly appear on the cliff-top.\n\nHe had seen the struggle by standing on a wall on the beach road, Whitley&#39;s approach having aroused his curiosity, and he had brought the car up that rocky and all but impossible slope. He had roared up in bottom gear, and though he was obviously scared stiff at the situation in which he found me, he acted with magnificent presence of mind.\n\nIt was quite impossible for a small chap like him to drag us back. He had no purchase for his feet, and the strain of our combined weight would simply have yanked him over as well.\n\nHe tied a couple of car rugs together to make a rope of them, and affixed one end to the back axle.\n\nThen he backed close up to me and tied the other end of the improvised rope in a sort of a slip-knot about my elbow.\n\nHe got back in the car again and opened up the throttle, leaning round from the driving-seat to watch the effect of his manoeuvre.\n\nI presently ventured to leave go of the root and grab the rug, trusting my entire weight to it.\n\nI slipped as I did so, and dropped about a foot over the edge. The jerk as the rug took my weight almost wrenched my arms adrift, at the same time freeing me of Whitley.\n\nHis hold slipped, and, yelling like the maniac he undoubtedly was by that time, he went hurtling to his death.\n\nThe car engine was roaring furiously, but there was no motion. I saw that the back wheels were skidding round on the grass, and the thing began slipping backwards.\n\nTommy jammed on the brakes and threw out the clutch. Then he tried again, but with no better result.\n\nThe back wheels were right on the edge of the cliff, and I was blackened and half senseless from the exhaust fumes before I managed to summon enough strength to haul myself up.\n\nI made Tommy get out of the car and leave it until it could be towed away. Good job I did, too, for he&#39;d no sooner alighted than the earth under the back wheels gave way and the tiling went slithering over. It was smashed to pieces on the beach alongside the mangled body of Whitley.\n\nAnyhow, we did get back to safety all right. Mighty close thing, though, wasn&#39;t it?\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nWhen &quot;Beaky&quot; Came Back\n\nHawke&#39;s silence left Sir Roger Mottram vaguely unsatisfied with the story.\n\n&quot;I thought,&quot; he said, &quot;that Beaky Binks was coming back into Whitley&#39;s life. I suppose that&#39;s one of the troubles with a true story—the obvious situation never develops.&quot;\n\n&quot;Beaky Binks!&quot; exclaimed Hawke. &quot;You don&#39;t suppose anybody would really have a name like that, do you? It&#39;s the name of a comic paper character popular many years ago. Boys habitually confer such titles on one another as nicknames.\n\n&quot;Beaky Binks,&quot; added the detective, &quot;was Mr. Smith.&quot;\n\nSir Roger sighed.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m obtuse,&quot; he said. &quot;I ought to have realised it, for it provides the point to the story.&quot;\n\n&quot;But what sticks in my mind,&quot; Hawke concluded, &quot;is what happened to Whitley. The platform on which he had built his ideals failed him. Beaky Binks had been the inspiration of his life, and Beaky Binks had let him down. Therein lies the real motive of the murder.\n\n&quot;Another aspect of the matter which should give you some food for thought, my dear Mottram, is that sunset photograph.\n\n&quot;That last bit of art was the one remnant of the old Beaky that had been the inspiration of Whitley&#39;s life.\n\n&quot;And it was that same last bit of Beaky&#39;s art which exposed Whitley&#39;s crime and settled his doom.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  What Merits Attention\n  Blood Money\n  Mrs. Fairbank&#39;s Bluff\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nWhat Merits Attention\n\nAs he approached the bedroom of Mrs. Norwood Fairbanks, James, her newly-hired butler, halted suddenly. Through the closed door he could hear his mistress talking on the telephone. He listened carefully.\n\nHe heard her say: &quot;Yes, dear, the new butler seems to be perfect. I&#39;m very glad I engaged him.&quot;\n\nJames allowed a smile to flit across his expansive, but normally impassive face. So Mrs. Fairbanks thought he was a perfect butler, did she? Not surprising. All his list of clients had thought the same when he was in their employ. Each had later given him a glowing reference. Not one had dared do otherwise … . So she called the person she was speaking to &quot;Dear.&quot; That merited attention.\n\nMrs. Fairbanks was saying: &quot;I miss you so much, Norwood.&quot;\n\nMerely a phone call to her husband, out West on a business trip. Not worth while listening to such a conversation. He knocked on the door, a gentle knock considering his bulk.\n\nJames heard a few more words, followed by good-byes, and knocked again.\n\n&quot;Come in.&quot;\n\nHe entered the superbly furnished room and bowed to the still beautiful woman of forty who occupied it. &quot;Your orders for the evening, madam.&quot;\n\nShe turned her dark eyes on him. &quot;I&#39;m dining out and going to a concert afterwards. I&#39;ll not return till late.&quot;\n\n&#39;Yes, madam.&quot;\n\nHalf an hour after Mrs. Fairbanks left the house, James re-entered her bedroom and approached her ornate Italian writing desk. Carefully he examined its intricate carvings.\n\nHis eyes gleamed as he located a secret drawer. From his pocket he drew a set of thin skeleton keys. The drawer was quickly opened. Only one thing lay in it —  a packet of a dozen letters, tied with baby-blue ribbon.\n\nHe picked up the packet and thumbed it hurriedly. All in the same handwriting. He glanced at one, addressed to &quot;Leona darling.&quot; The first name of Mrs. Fairbanks. Good, so far. Hastily he scanned ardent passages till he came to the signature &quot;Angelo.&quot; Wonderful! That bore out what he understood before applying for the position. He had heard that Mrs. Fairbanks had not always been discreet.\n\nJames stuffed the letters into a capacious back pocket. Before leaving the room, he glanced over his mistress&#39; check book and made a mental note of the monthly allowance she received from her husband.\n\nEarly the next morning he waited upon Mrs. Fairbanks. With a woebegone expression on his face, he let her glimpse a telegram which he partially drew from his pocket.\n\n&quot;To my regret, madam, I have just received word that my mother is very ill. So ill that I must leave for her bedside at once. May I, therefore, tender my resignation?&quot;\n\n&quot;Your resig —  Why, I&#39;m so sorry. I was quite well pleased with the way you were handling your work, James. Of course you may visit your mother. If you will be gone for a few days only, I&#39;ll keep the position open till you can return and resume your duties.&quot;\n\n&quot;There is no telling, madam, how long I must be away. I wouldn&#39;t want to inconvenience you for an indefinite period. However, I will promise to get in touch with you as soon as I do return.&quot;\n\nOn the following day, Mrs. Fairbanks received a phone call. &quot;James Frye speaking, madam.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m so glad to hear your voice. How is your mother? I hope she is well enough so you can come back now. As yet, I&#39;ve engaged no one to take your place.&quot;\n\n&quot;Alas, madam, I fear I will never reenter your employ. However, I hope this conversation means the beginning of cordial relations between us.&quot;\n\n&quot;Cordial relations between us?&quot;\n\n&quot;Why, yes, madam. Do you recall certain letters which you were so careless as to leave in your writing desk? If you will examine that desk, you will see that they have been removed for safe-keeping.&quot;\n\nHe heard her gasp of dismay followed by &quot;What!&quot;\n\n&#39;Yes, Mrs. Fairbanks, I have placed them where they will be safe from your husband&#39;s eyes — under certain conditions.&quot;\n\n&quot;Conditions?&quot;\n\n&quot;Simple ones. I will merely charge you a nominal fee for safe-keeping. It would give me great pleasure to add your name to others for whom I am keeping valuable documents — in your case for a hundred dollars a week.&quot;\n\n&quot;A hun —  Why, that&#39;s outrageous! I couldn&#39;t possibly pay that!&quot;\n\n&quot;I beg your pardon, madam, but I took the precaution of glancing through your check book. If you would cut down on your wardrobe — &quot;\n\n&#39;Your demand is preposterous!&quot;\n\n&quot;I doubt it, madam. I feel certain that your husband would pay — &quot;\n\n&quot;No, no. Don&#39;t speak to him about those letters. I — I&#39;ll try to raise the money somehow. I just don&#39;t know how, though.&quot;\n\n&quot;There are many ways, Mrs. Fairbanks. When I see you tomorrow, I will suggest some.&quot;\n\n&quot;You — you — &quot;\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t say it, madam, or I will be tempted to increase my modest demands. Now as to the first payment — could you bring it to my apartment tomorrow morning? Say at eleven? At that time you will run no risk of meeting others of my regular clients.&quot;\n\n&quot;I — I guess I must. Where do you live?&quot;\n\n&quot;At the Woodbine Apartments on Fiftieth Avenue. Seventh floor.&quot;\n\nAfter he hung up the phone, James rubbed his hands together. She would (make an excellent addition to his list I of clients. From now on he need never play the part of a butler again. His income would enable him to retire and live the life of a gentleman.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nBlood Money\n\nPromptly at eleven the next morning, he heard a ring at the door of his apartment. He opened it and bowed. &quot;Delighted to see you, Mrs. Fairbanks. Won&#39;t you come in?&quot;\n\n&quot;For — for a moment.&quot; She seemed palpably nervous as she entered his living room. &quot;I — I would like to speak to you about — about buying back those letters.&quot;\n\n&quot;I regret, madam, that those letters are not for sale.&quot;\n\n&quot;Not for sale? But please, James, those letters are so precious to me.&quot;\n\nHe permitted himself to smile.\n\n&quot;And even more precious to me. Let us understand each other once and for all. I will not sell you those letters. I will merely act as their guardian for the small sum of one hundred dollars a week.&quot;\n\nIt looked as if tears were about to flow. Brusqueness might stop them.\n\n&quot;Have you brought the first payment?&quot;\n\nShe bit her lips. Opening her purse, she drew out five twenty-dollar bills, and extended them towards James.\n\n&quot;Here is your blood money.&quot;\n\nHe raised one hand. &quot;Please, madam, don&#39;t consider this payment in that light. Please think of it as a mere gift of expiation.&quot;\n\nA dangerous light flashed momentarily in her eyes. She opened her mouth, only to snap it closed. After a brief pause, she asked in a strained voice: &quot;May I leave now?&quot;\n\n&quot;Certainly, madam.&quot; He stepped towards the door. &quot;Remember to return at the same hour next week.&quot;\n\n&quot;With another hundred dollars!&quot;\n\n&quot;Not necessarily money.&quot; He was bowing her out into the hall. &quot;For example, I recall you have a lovely Dresden china lamp in your living room. You could tell your husband that some careless parlor maid knocked it over and broke it into a hundred pieces. That lamp should add greatly to the appearance of my own living room. I would allow you — let me see — say, three weeks&#39; payments in return for it.&quot;\n\nShe was in the hall now. &quot;You — you — &quot; With a great effort she seemed able to control herself enough to beg again: &quot;Won&#39;t you please sell me those letters?&quot;\n\n&quot;No, I will not sell them. That is definite. I will merely act as their guardian for the small weekly fee I mentioned.&quot;\n\nShe shook her head. &quot;You have no heart.&quot;\n\nHe smiled again. &quot;That is why I am a success in my profession.&quot;\n\nHer eyes flashed fire, but she said nothing. With a shrug of her shoulders she turned to leave.\n\nAt that moment a man carrying a small suitcase approached from the direction of the elevator. Suddenly he dropped his suitcase and thrust a gun into James&#39; stomach. &quot;Up with your hands!&quot;\n\nJames raised his arms at once.\n\nThe newcomer half turned to Mrs. Fairbanks. &quot;Okay, lady?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot; She was smiling.\n\nThe man snapped at James: &quot;Where&#39;s them letters?&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nMrs. Fairbank&#39;s Bluff\n\nJames grinned. A big bluff on Mrs. Fairbanks&#39; part of course. She couldn&#39;t stand the notoriety of a shooting or a slugging.\n\n&quot;What fools you both are! To think I would be careless enough to let precious documents remain where they might be stolen. The letters to which you refer are perfectly safe in my box at the bank.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thanks for tippin&#39; me off where they was at, you rat. Now come along with me and get &#39;em.&quot;\n\nJames was laughing by now.\n\n&quot;Enough of this bluffing, my friends. Mrs. Fairbanks, this crude attempt to force me to deliver you the letters makes me insist on your bringing me two hundred dollars next week. Let this be a lesson to you. You might as well admit defeat and tell your boy friend to put away his revolver and leave. If he doesn&#39;t, I shall be forced to complain to the police.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re talkin&#39; to one of &#39;em now, wise guy.&quot; The man&#39;s free hand pulled back his coat. &quot;Detective Hayes from headquarters.&quot;\n\n&quot;What!&quot;\n\n&quot;Sure.&quot; The detective slipped a pair of handcuffs over James&#39; wrists. He turned to Mrs. Fairbanks. &quot;Mighty brave of you, lady, to show up this here rat. Mighty few folks would&#39;ve had the guts to do it. The department sure thanks you.&quot;\n\nJames sneered, &quot;I&#39;ll be sorry for you, madam, when those letters are published in the newspapers. I certainly would like to hear what your husband will say when he sees them.&quot;\n\nThat evening Mrs. Fairbanks was again telephoning her husband.\n\n&quot;Who would have taken James for a crook? He was so efficient and so gentlemanly. Such excellent references, too. I&#39;m beginning to wonder about the people who wrote them … I&#39;m awfully sorry about the letters. I&#39;m afraid people will be greatly amused when they read the ardent passages you wrote me when we were first married. Remember how you signed them &#39;Angelo&#39; because it was the silly pet name I gave you on our Italian honeymoon? Now you&#39;ll have to write me some nice new letters to keep in my secret drawer till the police give me my others back.&quot;\n\nAfter saying good-bye and hanging up, Mrs. Fairbanks locked the door leading to her bedroom. She pulled out the secret drawer of her writing desk. Her hand groped about in the cavity behind it. From there she drew a packet of letters tied with pink ribbon. Sighing, she kissed each letter, then consigned them to the flames in her fireplace for safekeeping.\n\n~ The End ~\n"

My eyes have looked upon sights which God did not intend that man should see. My life must pay the forfeit. As a man of science, you may be interested in hearing what I have to say — and I must unburden myself to someone before I pass out into the Great Unknown. But five days have passed since I said good-bye to old Sourdough Jamison. It seems as many centuries.”\n\nProfessor Parmalee gave the speaker a quick glance.\n\n“Did I understand you to say that you left Jamison’s five days ago? Are you sure about that?”\n\nThe man on the cot nodded.\n\n“On the twentieth of June, to be exact.”\n\n“There is no possibility of your being mistaken?”\n\n“None whatever. My diary will prove it. I made my last entry the night before I left Sourdough’s place — on the nineteenth.”\n\nThe professor sat silent for a second. “There is something wrong with your story, Blake. The nearest route over the mountains, from here, is by way of Chicahoochie pass, which would make the distance from this point to Sourdough Jamison’s cabin a matter of over a hundred and fifty miles. This is the twenty-fifth of June. A well man couldn’t do it. It is an impossibility for you to have made it in five days in your weakened condition. Not that I wish to dispute your word, but — “\n\nThe sick man smiled wanly.\n\n“Don’t you see, professor, that your own statement helps to support my story? I tell you that I wandered into an undiscovered route through the mountains. You say that you picked me up half an hour ago lying exhausted and unconscious a few rods from your camp. That being the case, the entrance to The Valley Where Dead Men Live, on this side of the range, must be near at hand.”\n\n“You’ll say I’m crazy when I tell you that I have seen living dead men! Dead men who do not know that they are dead. Can you imagine it? No? Neither could I if I had not seen it myself. I’ve been through the Valley of the Living Dead and came out alive! I’ve seen them — living dead men — by the millions and millions, fighting, stabbing, shooting — tearing at each other’s throats like maddened beasts! And beasts they are, maddened by blood! Blood flows in rivers in the valley where the dead men live. It’s the rage they were in when they died. They carried it on with them beyond the grave and they’re fighting it out in there!\n\n“Can’t you hear the rumble of cannon? Listen! You think that it’s thunder. But it’s not. And those flashes that you notice just over the brow of the mountain! The flashes of the big guns, man — spirit guns! No, no. It’s not lightning. I’m telling you the truth. I now that you think I’m insane. I don’t blame you.”\n\nHe stopped suddenly, his nostrils dilating.\n\n“Take a whiff of that breeze, professor. Don’t you smell anything?”\n\nParmalee sniffed.\n\n“The air from the mountains does have a peculiar, acrid odor. It’s reminiscent of something.”\n\n“Gunpowder!”\n\n“By George! That’s what it is. Somebody must have fired a weapon close at hand. And yet, why didn’t we hear the report?”\n\nThe scientist gazed out of the tent door.\n\n“It was none of my party. They are all accounted for. Yet I could have sworn that there was not another human being within fifty miles.”\n\nBlake smiled again.\n\n“I merely called it to your attention, Professor, so that you would give more credence to my story. It is so strange — this story of the living dead — that it will stretch your imagination to the utmost. I am a sick man. I doubt if I survive the day. You, as a scientific man, may be able to discover the solution of the puzzle.\n\n“Perhaps you may even be able to do something to help release those poor devils in there from the tie of hatred that is binding them to this earth. At any rate, I would like to tell you my yarn if you care to listen. Just give me another sip of that moose broth, will you?”\n\nRaising the sick man’s head, Professor Parmalee fed him a small quantity of the warm soup. Then he sat down again beside the cot in an attitude of attention.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Absolute Truth\n\n“You are going to put me down as the greatest liar since the world began,” Blake said, wearily. “Yet every word that I tell you is the absolute truth. My mind was never clearer than at the present time, so don’t think that what I say to you is the raving of a disordered brain, either.\n\n“You have heard the theory advanced by believers in spiritualism that some people who die suddenly persist in keeping in touch with the earth, while others go directly on to their reward. I have seen enough to prove — but I digress. My time is short. Let me start at the beginning.\n\n“When the war broke out, I attempted to enlist, but was rejected on account of my physical condition. Nerves. But I finally succeeded in hooking up with the Red Cross and got over. I was gassed and later got a dose of shell shock. You know what that means? Nerves, pure and simple. It is needless to tell you that I suffered all of the torments of hell. So we’ll pass that up and go on.\n\n“I landed in the States a physical wreck. The doctors sent me to the mountains. I am awealthy man, but it suited my mood to travel light and alone. I wandered here and there until I finally reached this north country. I studied geology once and, while I don’t need the money, I decided to do a little prospecting.\n\n“A week or so ago I reached the cabin of Sourdough Jamison, having canoed up the river nearly two hundred miles. I remained with the old man three days, resting up, then announced my intention of striking out directly into the mountains. Jamison tried his best to dissuade me. He claimed that the Indians had a legend that there was a valley located somewhere in the middle of the range which was the abiding place of spirits — ‘The Valley Where Dead Men Live’ they called, it — and that nobody who entered it ever came back alive. I’ve been through it and I’m out of it. But I’m no better than a dead man, so the old legend holds good. But I hope when I do pass out that my soul can rest in peace. God! I don’t want to spend an eternity in that hell hole back yonder.\n\n“I will not bore you with the details of my trip up the mountains — for I started early next morning in spite of Jamison’s objections. That night I camped half way up the side of the range. Next morning — that would be four days ago — I chanced upon a little canyon that wound in and out among the rocks. There were signs of gold, and I determined to explore it thoroughly before going further.\n\n“As I continued, the air grew colder. From somewhere ahead came a dull, indescribable roar. I put it down to a waterfall somewhere in the distance.\n\n“Suddenly, after a two hours’ tramp, I reached the end of the narrow pathway and found myself on the edge of a steep decline, ice covered, slippery — a veritable man trap — which seemed to surround a huge, deep basin. The entire place was buried under a pall of smoke which hid everything from view. On all sides rose the mountains, rugged, their peaks covered with snow, offering an impassable barrier. The path by which I had entered seemed to be the only means of getting in or out.\n\n“Up, out of the basin, there came to my ears a steady, rumbling booming. The air was filled with it. The earth seemed to tremble under my feet at frequent intervals.\n\n“Sometimes the noise would die out for a second, only to start again with renewed violence. There was nothing to be frightened at, yet I confess that the goose pimples came to the surface and I felt the icy chills run up and down my spine. My hair stood up like the quills of a porcupine. The very atmosphere seemed filled with despair — with a vague something the human mind could not grasp.\n\n“Suddenly the wind brought to my ears a shout. Then came the shrill, piercing, agonized scream of a woman — a shriek that was filled with terror and helplessness. Again and again it assailed my ears. Shouting in answer,\n\nI ran along the edge of the precipice, looking for a pathway that would lead me to the rescue of her who called.\n\n“As I ran along the narrow shelf of ice, I threw off my heavy pack and carried only my rifle. Then, I slipped and lost my footing. My gun flew from my grasp. I struggled to save myself, but without avail. Over the slippery edge I slid — down — down — down! It seemed to me that I rolled for miles. There was absolutely nothing which I could grasp to stop my wild plunge. Nothing but ice — ice — ice — cold and smooth as glass. Faster and faster I went, until my speed was that of an express train. I almost lost consciousness. I could not think. Suddenly I struck the bottom with a force that knocked me senseless.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Most Horrible Scene of Carnage\n\n“I was awakened from my stupor by a peculiar rat-tat-tat that sounded like the rattle of a drum. I opened my eyes. The air was filled with acrid smoke. It hung over me like a great gray blanket.. Was I dead? I raised myself on my elbows and looked about me. For an instant I imagined that I was back in Flanders. Then I remembered my fall. But where was I?\n\n“The ground was covered with bodies, heaped up in grotesque attitudes, lying in odd-shaped piles. It was a. veritable charnel house — a page torn from Dante’s Inferno. And such bodies in peculiar, transparent, crystalline. I could see through them as one looks through a heavy plate-glass. Heavens! It was horrible — hideous. And blood! Blood everywhere. The air rang with shrieks and groans and laughter — wild, haunting laughter that froze the marrow in my bones.\n\n“Close beside me a machine-gun was rattling, served by a sergeant and two privates wearing the olive drab. All three were of the same peculiar, grayish cast of pellucidness as were the bodies lying around. On all sides guns were booming. The ground rocked beneath them.\n\n“Was I dreaming? Was I the victim of a horrible nightmare in which my subconscious mind was again living the scenes I had gone through across the seas? I pinched myself to make sure. I was at a loss for an explanation. I shook like an aspen leaf; I was filled with supernatural terror.\n\n“Then something happened that gave me a better light on the matter. Just at my right was a small knoll, scarred and pitted with machine-gun nests. Through the drab, smoky haze, I could see the ill-fitting German uniforms on the men who manned them. Across the gap which separated them from me a man was crawling — dragging himself along on hands and knees. He turned his head toward me for an instant. I recognized Howard Prestin, an old friend — a captain of infantry, who had been killed in the Argonne after silencing a number of German guns which had stopped the American advance.\n\n“Did he still live? But no. I had seen his body the day it was buried. Was I crazy? My head whirled. I was unable to move, so transfixed was I by what was going on around me.\n\n“Suddenly I saw Prestin leap forward. A dozen guns opened on him. Yet they failed to stop him. I saw him fire from the hip. Then he leaped among the Germans with the butt-end of his rifle. A second later he hurled the weapon aside, and, drawing his automatic from its holster, he sprang into a second nest. The man seemed to bear a charmed life. The Germans swarmed over him time after time. But after each effort he emerged triumphant. His clothes hung on him in tatters. He was bleeding from a dozen wounds. His face was a red smear through which his eyes gleamed like burning coals.\n\n“A German officer — a great, hulking, blond man — fired a pistol point-blank at him. It failed to stop his rush. Both reached for their trench knives. They came together, locked in a death struggle, their weapons plying like mad. Slowly the German dropped to the ground, a peculiar, dazed look on his flat, round face. Prestin turned wearily away and beckoned, as if waving for his men to move forward. Then he crumpled up and fell forward across his victim’s body.\n\n“Then, I knew the truth — the horrible truth! The legend of the Indians was not fiction. This was the valley where dead men lived. Here men, who could not break their earthly ties, came back to fight on and on until their Berserker rage had expended itself. Here they were enacting over and over again the final tragedy of their lives. God! It was the most diabolical thing that the human mind could imagine.\n\n“Think of it. All over that vast plain, in the midst of that ice-bound valley, similar tragedies were being enacted by men — dead men. Wraiths were grappling here, there and everywhere. The peculiar feature of it all was that I seemed to be able to see each individual feat of valor at the same time, although they were transpiring over miles of territory. It was like looking at an immense moving picture which unreeled itself before me. I can liken it to nothing better than one of the huge, old-fashioned panoramas that were in vogue a few years after the Civil War, some few of which still remain in Southern cities. I seemed to be floating over the entire basin. The guns seemed to be real guns, shooting real bullets, the cannon were the monsters of steel that I had seen in France. Yet I swear, that several times I passed directly through barrages unscathed. The weapons, like the men who served them, were only phantoms.\n\n“God in Heaven! It was the most horrible scene of carnage I have ever witnessed — more awful than the hell of France and Belgium. For every detail was the result of the terrible ire under which the combatants labored when they met their death. As fast as they had played their parts, they started in at the beginning and went through it again and again, over and over, like automatons — held to their posts by a divine decree of some kind.\n\n“Words fail me. It was so unspeakably ghastly, weird — a futurist nightmare — a bedlam of noise and confusion — a kaleidoscopic phantasmagoria of light and color. Death walked everywhere. Remember, Professor, on a battlefield, the men do not die in great numbers and lie around in heaps. Hours, days — sometimes weeks — pass without carnage. Even in the heat of conflict only a small percentage of those engaged meet death. Here it was different. For miles in every direction there was death — death — death ! Nothing but cold, stark death — death and blood!\n\n“Explain? I can’t. My idea is, as I stated before, that man must work out his own salvation — that those who died in the heat of anger must work that hatred off before their spirits can quit this earth. God, in His infinity wisdom, did not care to inflict the horror upon the entire world, so He set aside this barren hole, as a place where dead men might sever the ties which bind them here, and, with their passion cooled, pass on to a better life.\n\n“No, the man never lived who could describe it — that cold, ice-bound hell. The air tingled with madness. And the look of awful malignancy on the faces of those poor souls as they went on and on and on through the same monotonous performance of killing and being killed. It was butchery. The place was a slaughter-house. Ah, the deeds of valor that I saw performed! Wonderful! Magnificent! History will never be able to record the actual happenings — the cold-blooded bravery.\n\n“Through the hazy heavens phantom aeroplanes manned by ghostly pilots dipped and maneuvered, dodging — falling to the earth in tangled masses, often burning. Gigantic balloons, in flames, tossed amidst the clouds.\n\n“Among a heap of stones — the remains of what had once been a tiny church located in the center of an ancient graveyard — a sniper carried on his nefarious trade, his hiding-place a tomb from which the bodies had been hurled aside. I saw a group approach the place, grim determination written on their faces. Their beloved colonel had been a victim of the sniper’s bullets. They found him after a long search. A youngster — he had been the colonel’s orderly — leaped upon him. A knife plunged up — down — up — down, slowly, monotonously, while the screams of him into whose body it was sinking made the night hideous. And when he had completed his work on that dead thing with the glassy eyes that gazed upward, unseeingly, the youngster calmly wiped his weapon upon the tunic of the vanquished foe.\n\n“Oh, the look of vengeance that was upon the countenances of that little group! A shell came screaming through the heavens! They attempted to dodge to cover. But too late. And so the awful drama went on and on and on.\n\n“There is no rest for those who dwell in the Valley Where Dead Men Live!\n\n“Men fought with the ferocity of wild beasts. They were blood mad, frenzied. A little detachment of Englishmen were laboring with automatic rifles just at the edge of a woods. In front of them was a tiny vale through which wound a sunken road. On the opposite side of the valley was another thicket in which were a seemingly equal number of Germans. It was a duel to the death between the two groups. Both seemed to exhaust their ammunition at the same time. By what appeared to be mutual consent they left their guns and charged at each other, meeting in the middle of that once peaceful little dell.\n\n“There were not over twenty men on either side. Grappling, they fought hand to hand, using knives, clubs, stones, their revolvers — their bare hands. They were like cave-dwellers, giving no quarter and asking none. At the end, there was no one left on either side. Only a heap of dead and dying. When it was all over the dead arose and again went through the monotonous performance.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nPhantoms — Too Horribly Real\n\n“I was hypnotized, held by a spell I could not break. Try as I would, I seemed unable to drag myself away from the ghastly sights. I don’t know how long I remained in the valley of horrors. You say it was four days. Look at my hair — snow white! When I left Sourdough’s cabin my locks were dark. I am just past thirty years of age. Yet, from my appearance, one would swear that I had passed the three score years and ten allotted to man.\n\n“I have not slept. For the hellish panorama continued on and on and on. Only, at night, a different group of actors filled the stage. The darkness was hideous with the roar of the big guns, the screech of shells. Signal rockets filled the air. As if by magic, trenches appeared here and there — little sectors each with its own melancholy drama of life and death. Here was a stretch of no man’s land with its grisly tenants. Men hung on barbed-wire entanglements, their clothes in tatters, swaying to and fro in the breeze like scarecrows in a farmer’s field.\n\n“Often I lost consciousness — fainted, I suppose. Much of the time I wandered about in a daze. I knew not which way to turn. Dead men — living dead men — everywhere!\n\n“I dragged myself into a tiny house that seemed to stand in the center of the valley. It was empty. I threw myself on the floor, thinking to gain a minute’s respite from the horrors around me. I dropped into a deep sleep.\n\n“I was awakened by the sound of voices. I crouched farther back in the darkness of the corner, frightened, not daring to make a move. What was I afraid of? I do not know.\n\n“One need not fear spectres, need he? There was a sound of a match being scratched. And then a candle flared up. By its uncertain light I made out the figures of two men wearing the German uniform.\n\n“They groped about until they found a trap door cut in the floor. Raising it, they lowered themselves through the opening. Seized by some impulse which, even now, I am unable to explain, I determined to follow them. The events that transpired are inexplicable to me. The only solution that I have for the puzzle is that, for the time being, I was someone else — some poor devil who lost his life in the attempt to avert a German surprise on Verdun. For I swear that I was propelled by some force stronger than my own will.\n\n“Cautiously I waited until I heard their voices trailing off in the distance. Then I sprang to the trap and, a second later, dropped through into the darkness of the cellar.\n\n“I stumbled about until I found the wall. Following it with my hands, I came to an opening. Far ahead in the darkness, I saw a tiny speck of light bobbing up and down. It was the candle carried by the men I was following. Without thought of the future, I followed in their wake.\n\n“On, on, on they went. Then, suddenly, the passageway widened out into a huge cavern. Relying on the darkness, I crept closer until I was only a few yards away from them. Hiding behind a huge pile of boxes and barrels heaped up at one side, I listened to their conversation. At first I was unable to understand what they were about to do.\n\nThen, with a muttered ‘Shhh!’ one of them cautiously drew aside a small block of what appeared to be solid rock, and, peeping out over my hiding-place, I gazed through the little opening into a brilliantly-lighted passageway. I caught a glimpse of uniforms; through the opening came scraps of conversation in French.\n\n“The truth flashed over me. I was looking into the underground defenses of Verdun. The Germans had tunneled up to them and were waiting only for the minute that the defenders were the fewest, to break down the thin barrier which held them back and throw their hordes into the very vitals of the French defense. Even as the thought came to me, the watcher closed the opening softly and, with a muttered word to his companion, lighted a lantern and waved it across his body like a signal torch. And a signal it was. For instantly a distant whistle sounded. Then lights leaped up as far as the eye could see. And from the distance came the tramp, tramp, tramp of marching feet.\n\n“I forgot that I was dealing with phantoms. The thing was too horribly real. I searched about me for a weapon for some way to warn the unsuspecting men on the other side of that frail partition. In the semi-darkness to which I was rapidly growing accustomed my eyes fell upon an open box. It was heaped up with hand grenades. I made out the markings of other boxes. I almost shouted for joy. For the pile was a huge ammunition dump, placed there by the invaders in readiness for the crucial moment.\n\n“Seizing a grenade in either hand, I pulled the pins with my teeth and held them in readiness. Closer and closer came the German hordes. The whole cavern and passageway was filled with them. There were thousands, it seemed. The air was thick and heavy with the odor of their sweat. Then, just as the head of the column reached me, I hurled the bombs — not at the advancing enemy, but straight into the big pile of ammunition. The leaders heard me, saw me. They came at me with a rush.\n\n“The ground trembled. … A concussion! I felt myself being hurled through the air … Around me rang screams and cries of mortal agony …  Then came oblivion.”There is nothing more that I can tell you. How I came here, I have no recollection. Evidently, my mind a blank, I found some exit on this side of the valley. I only know that you found me here, outside. My secret is yours. As a man of science, you will probably try to find the way into the place from which I have corner Take my advice and stay away. Now I am tired, Professor. I must rest.’’\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Report of Professor Parmalee\n\n(Extract from the report of Professor Phineas Parmalee, A.B., LL.D., etc.)\n\n“Mr. Blake passed away shortly after completing his strange narrative. The members of the Parmalee Scientific Expedition spent nearly a week searching the vicinity in the hope of discovering the opening through which he came from the valley.\n\n“But our efforts were fruitless. I would be tempted to put his story of ‘The Valley Where Dead Men Live’ down as an hallucination resulting from his terrible experiences during the war, but for one thing: I sent a courier by way of Chicahoochie Pass to interview Jamison.\n\n“The letter says that the date given by Blake was correct. He crossed the mountains, as he stated, in five days. I confess myself puzzled …\n\n“We buried poor Blake where we found him.\n\nRequiescat In Pace!”\n\n~ The End ~\n"

Against the background of the ruined fort stood a man who faced them calmly, revolver in hand. He wore the uniform of the Indian Army, but his clothes were torn and a stained bandage was wrapped around his head.\n\nAbove the crowd swung the beam of a great derrick, to the end of which was attached a platform. It was the carrier for the camera crew of Realistic Pictures Limited, and, what was more important, it gave director Raymond Blade an excellent view of the scene.\n\nHe was a little man with a bald head and a fat face. His small eyes glittered as he stared down from the chair on which he was sitting.\n\n&quot;Cut!&quot; he bellowed to the crowd of Afghans. &quot;Rotten!&quot; he added, as the rush at the fort stopped abruptly. &quot;You&#39;re acting like a ham, Farr. Remember you&#39;re supposed to be the last man left alive of the garrison, and this is your final stand. Act! Don&#39;t stand there like a dummy!&quot;\n\nMichael Farr, the young actor who was playing the lead in Realistic&#39;s latest production, &quot;The Wolf of the Border,&quot; scowled as he looked up at the director.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m doing my best, Mr. Blade,&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;Your best! I could pick a dozen men out of the extras who could do better! &quot; The director gave an unpleasant laugh. &quot;Remember you are of no importance,&quot; he went on. &quot;None of you are of any importance. When it comes to making a film, the director is the only one who counts!&quot;\n\n&quot;Listen here—&quot; Michael Farr began furiously.\n\n&quot;Clear for action!&quot; Blade bellowed through his megaphone. &quot;We&#39;ll take it this time. Camera! Sound!&quot;\n\nThe crowd surged forward with a savage yell. The hero levelled his revolver and began to shoot. Rifles cracked as the Afghans fired back. And over that very realistic scene swung the beam of the derrick, with the director perched on the end.\n\nSuddenly he stooped to lift his megaphone again. The &quot;battle &quot; was raging furiously, and nobody noticed the director clutch at his side and pitch forward.\n\nHe fell thirty feet, landing among the artificial rocks which had recently given shelter to the screen Afghans. It was the cameraman who gave the shout which caused everybody to turn and see the crumpled body.\n\nThe studio doctor ran on to the set and knelt to make his examination. He scrambled up hurriedly.\n\n&quot;Stay where you are, everybody!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Don&#39;t move!&quot;\n\nHe rushed to the nearest telephone, and dialed Whitehall 1212.\n\n&quot;Scotland Yard?&quot; he said when he was put through. &quot;I&#39;m speaking from the Realistic Studios. A man has been murdered. The director, Raymond Blade. Shot! Right through the heart.&quot;\n\n&quot;Two hundred armed men on the set! &quot; he whispered as he replaced the receiver. &quot;And every one of them had reason to wish Blade dead. No chance of it being an accident. The weapons were loaded with blanks, but somebody slipped a live cartridge into his gun.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Jealous Lover\n\n&quot;murder! &quot; agreed Chief Inspector Baxter when he arrived on the scene.\n\nThe Yard officer had made a rapid survey of the situation, and, like the doctor, he was convinced that no chance shot had brought the director plunging from his chair. For two weeks Raymond Blade had scourged stars and extras alike with insults and biting sarcasm. He had made himself the most hated man in the studios.\n\nThe inspector began a patient investigation, and nobody was allowed to leave the studios. All weapons were collected and sent to the police laboratory for examination by experts. There might be a chance that they would find the gun from which the bullet had been fired.\n\nBaxter was feeling rather tired, when he saw a tall man in loose-fitting tweeds walking briskly towards him. He recognised Dixon Hawke.\n\n&quot;What brings you here?&quot; he asked as Hawke reached him.\n\n&quot;The film company. They want me to prove this shooting was an accident.&quot;\n\n&quot;A fat chance you&#39;ve got! It&#39;s plain murder, and I&#39;ve got my finger on the likely man already! &quot;\n\n&quot;Good work, Baxter. Who is he?&quot;\n\n&quot;Michael Farr, the male lead in the film! Not only did he have more reason than anybody else for shooting Blade, but he was actually heard to make a threat against him!&quot;\n\nBaxter was glad to talk the case over with Hawke, and he gave him the full details of his investigations.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s a girl in it,&quot; he said gruffly. &quot;Her name is Mary Meade, and she plays a small part. Farr is in love with her. Unfortunately, she came under Blade&#39;s influence.&quot;\n\n&quot;I suppose he said he would make her a star?&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s it. The man was a swine. Farr had a quarrel with him, and then he was heard to say that if Blade didn&#39;t leave the girl alone he would shoot him.&quot;\n\n&quot;What about the gun?&quot;\n\n&quot;There were twenty revolvers of the pattern used by Farr scattered among the crowd.&quot;\n\n&quot;What about the others who were handling these revolvers?&quot;\n\n&quot;I haven&#39;t a thing on them. If you&#39;d like to see them, you&#39;re welcome. They&#39;re in the small studio down the corridor.&quot;\n\nDixon Hawke went to the room where the group of extras had been herded.\n\nHe stopped for a moment at the manager&#39;s office to talk to Mary Meade. She had little to say, except that Farr had been very jealous.\n\nThe criminologist continued on his way to the small studio. It was packed with men still dressed in the robes of Afghans. Hawke talked to each man in turn.\n\nHe learned little. The extras had been supplied with guns and blank ammunition, and ordered to rush the stage fort and make as much noise as possible. They had been too busy with the scene to know that anything had happened until the cameraman shouted.\n\nHawke came to one man who was sitting moodily in a corner smoking a cigarette. He was older than the others, and as the investigator approached he stood up with quiet dignity.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA &quot;Silent&quot; Success\n\n\n  \n    \n      &quot;YOU are John Garry?&quot; Hawke\n      said, glancing at the list of extras, &quot;What do you know about this business, Mr. Garry?&quot;\n    \n  \n\n\n&quot;I am as ignorant as the rest,&quot; the man said. &quot;I am sure it was an accident,&quot; he went on. &quot;A fortunate accident, if I may say so. Raymond Blade is better dead!&quot;\n\n&quot;I wouldn&#39;t advise you to make such statements,&quot; the criminologist rapped. He looked at the man&#39;s face closely, and gave a puzzled frown, for there was something unmistakably familiar about it.\n\n&quot;Were you ever on the stage?&quot; he asked abruptly.\n\n&quot;Minor parts! Minor parts! My talents have never been fully recognised.&quot;\n\nWhen he had finished his questioning of the extras, Hawke went to see the producer in charge of Realistic Films, and discovered he was a man who had been in the movie business from the earliest days.\n\n&quot;Raymond Blade was an old-timer, wasn&#39;t he?&quot; Hawke asked.\n\n&quot;He&#39;d been in the business from silent days. Don&#39;t you remember that remarkable film, &#39;Riders of the Range&#39;? It came out about 1924.&quot;\n\nHawke nodded. The film had been one of the outstanding productions of the time. &quot;But that was American,&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;Blade was an American. We brought him over for this new production. He&#39;s never looked back since silent days. &#39;Riders of the Range&#39; made him.&quot;\n\n&quot;I have a recollection of the actor who played the dashing hero in that film. What&#39;s become of him?&quot;\n\n&quot;A typical tragedy of the screen, Mr. Hawke! You mean Edmund Walders, who used to play the lead in the old Westerners. He gradually sank into obscurity, and nobody knows what happened to him! &quot;\n\n&quot;As far as I remember, he gave Blade his chance.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes. Raymond Blade owed his success to Edmund Walders, and Blade was also responsible for this Walders&#39; downfall! &quot;\n\n&quot;Really?&quot;\n\n&quot;When Blade became famous he refused to direct Walders. I think they had some private quarrel over a woman.&quot;\n\n&quot;By Jove! &quot; Hawke got to his feet suddenly. A very clear picture of Walders in &#39;Riders of the Range&#39; had suddenly come to him, and it started a strange train of thought in his mind.\n\nThe criminologist reached the main studio a few minutes after Chief Inspector Baxter had given the actors and staff permission to leave. The Yard officer was satisfied with his investigation, and had placed Michael Farr under detention. There was sufficient evidence to warrant an arrest.\n\nHawke went to the door and watched the crowd trooping out. An oldish man with grey hair went by, and Hawke reached out and touched him on the shoulder.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re Mr. Garry, aren&#39;t you?&quot; the criminologist said. &quot;I thought I recognised you, although you were in Afghan warpaint last time we met.&quot;\n\n&quot;When?&quot;\n\n&quot;Mr. Garry, I never forget a face, and yours is familiar. Were you ever prominent on the stage or screen?&quot;\n\nThe extra drew himself up and a look of pride flashed into his eyes. Then his shoulders sagged and he shook his head slowly.\n\n&quot;My talents never received recognition,&quot; he muttered.\n\n&quot;Did you ever act under another name?&quot;\n\n&quot;Why should I?&quot; the man said. &quot;If they don&#39;t like me as John Garry, then they won&#39;t like me under any other name.&quot;\n\nHawke let him go and beckoned to the head of the casting department, who happened to be passing. He learned that John Garry lived in Putney, and, having written down the address, he left the studios.\n\nThe criminologist took a taxi to Putney and made careful inquiries about the man. He found that Garry had been staying at a cheap boardinghouse for several years, but beyond that he could learn nothing.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m certain of one thing,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Garry is not his real name, and I think I know who he really is! &quot;\n\nHe walked up a quiet street not far from the boarding-house where the extra lived. Hawke paused outside a small local cinema. A poster had caught his eye. It was an advertisement for one of the greatest of the silent films.\n\nStepping into the lobby, he asked to see the manager. A pleasant little man came out of the small office. In answer to Hawke&#39;s questions, he said that he was reviving old films to show the development of the cinema. This type of programme was popular, he added.\n\n&quot;Of course, my audience finds them amusing,&quot; he said. &quot;Films that used to make people weep now make them laugh.&quot;\n\nThe criminologist filled his pipe slowly. An idea was forming in his mind.\n\n&quot;Did you ever see a film called &#39;Riders of the Range&#39;?&quot; he asked.\n\n&quot;With Edmund Walders? I remember it well.&quot;\n\n&quot;Will you scrap your next week&#39;s programme and show it?&quot; Hawke asked. He saw the man hesitate. &quot;My request concerns a matter of the utmost importance,&quot; he added, &quot;and of course you will be compensated for any financial loss.&quot;\n\n&quot;The film will be shown, Mr. Hawke,&quot; the manager said.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nReal-Life Drama\n\nThe criminologist took rooms in Putney facing the small cinema. With his assistant, Tommy Burke, he kept watch on the place, and on several occasions saw the extra, John Garry, pass by. The man made a habit of pausing to look at the posters advertising the old film.\n\nIt was not until the middle of the week that Garry finally bought a ticket and entered the cinema. Tommy, who was at the window, reported to his chief, and Hawke reached for his hat and hurried out, with Burke at his heels. They, too, went into the cinema.\n\nThe show had apparently just begun and an early Chaplin film was on the screen. Hawke saw Garry sitting at the back of the hall, and dropped into a seat behind him. The man was watching the antics of the great comedian closely, and did not notice their arrival.\n\nSeveral shorts were shown, and finally, the main film was flashed on.\n\nThe story of &quot;Riders of the Range &quot; was typical of the early days of the movies. There was the Mexican villain who was trying to steal the ranch owned by the heroine.\n\nAnd then there entered the hero, the mysterious cowboy with the reputation of being a bandit. It had been a great part for Edmund Walders, but the modern audience shrieked with laughter as they watched the old-fashioned drama unfold.\n\nJohn Garry, however, showed no inclination to laugh, as Hawke was quick to observe. The old actor had his hat between his hands, and was twisting it with nervous fingers. His eyes never left the screen, but several times, when the laughter became unusually loud, he moved as if to get up.\n\nThe drama worked up to its climax. Edmund Walders was hunted by the sheriff&#39;s posse, while the villain and his men raided the heroine&#39;s ranch. The gallant messenger, wounded by the Mexicans, spurred his tired horse to bring the news to Walders.\n\nAnd when the hero fought his way through the sheriff&#39;s men to stage the great rescue, the audience fairly howled with laughter at the expense of the forgotten star.\n\nHawke had been watching John Garry closely, and when the man suddenly sprang to his feet the criminologist was in no way surprised.\n\n&quot;Laugh! &quot; the man shouted. &quot;Laugh, you fools! You liked it once. You called &#39; Riders of the Range &#39; the greatest film that had been produced.&quot;\n\nPeople turned and stared blankly at the interrupter. Garry pointed dramatically at the screen, where Edmund Walders was staging his great fight with the villain.\n\n&quot;That was acting! &quot; he screamed. &quot;Real acting! There was no fake about that. We rode our own horses and fired our own guns. Yes! And I can still shoot straight.&quot;\n\nSuddenly the lights went up, and, for the first time, the audience saw clearly the man who had caused the disturbance. They had not sat through the silent film for nothing, and they recognised the stranger as the hero whose acting they had laughed at.\n\nJohn Garry was none other than Edmund Walders.\n\nWalders turned and glared behind him, and his eyes widened as he saw Dixon Hawke.\n\n&quot;Take it easy,&quot; the criminologist said quietly. &quot;I thought your name wasn&#39;t Garry!&quot;\n\nThe one-time star flashed a hand towards his coat pocket, but Hawke caught him by the wrist. They struggled for a moment, and then the man&#39;s arm was forced back, and the revolver in his pocket was swiftly removed by Tommy Burke. A policeman, called by the manager, hurried down the aisle, and Walders was escorted from the cinema.\n\nHe hung limply in the officer&#39;s grip and had to be supported to the lobby. Hawke looked at him pityingly.\n\n&quot;Why did you kill Raymond Blade?&quot; h.6 tasked\n\n&quot;Kill him? I—&quot; Walders suddenly lifted his head, and there was a mad gleam in his eyes as he faced his accuser.\n\n&quot;Yes, I killed him!&quot; he snarled. &quot;I killed him because he was a rat! I gave him his chance, and he thanked me with ruin! He drove the woman I loved to suicide! He—he—&quot;\n\n&quot;You did it because seeing him in such a position of authority, while you were forgotten, caused something to snap in your mind,&quot; Hawke suggested. &quot;Isn&#39;t that right, Walders?&quot;\n\n&quot;It was his manner. The way he bullied people. The way he treated young Farr, who is one of the most promising actors on the screen today. He didn&#39;t recognise me, the man who had made him. I— It was so easy! I put a real bullet in my revolver, and when we played the scene of attacking the fort I shot him. I couldn&#39;t miss. I always was a dead shot!&quot;\n\n***\n\nHawke took the prisoner to Scotland Yard, and Michael Farr was at once released. Chief Inspector Baxter looked at his friend admiringly.\n\n&quot;It beats me how you hit on the truth,&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;Just luck, old man. I have a good memory for faces, and I hadn&#39;t forgotten Walders. I followed up my hunch by having the old film shown at the cinema. I knew the audience would laugh, and cause the poor fellow to give himself away.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n"

He was short, squat, with an oblong head, and a thick growth of jet black hair grew vigorously above his low forehead. His jaws were heavy and distinct, and his mouth was fixed in a habitual sneer.\n\nHe moved casually up the fire-escape, ascending with apparent unconcern. Little Joe was muscular, thick-set; an ape-like animal.\n\nEarlier in the morning Joe had tried to borrow five dollars from Pug, but had been refused. Even though Pug had made two hundred dollars the day before, he declined to make a loan to Joe.\n\nAnd Joe had a &quot;sure thing&quot; on the third race at Belmont. By investing five he would win sixty. Often before Pug had staked him. This morning, however, Pug had been surly and vicious. Too much bootleg. Pug dealt in illicit liquors, and sometimes he sampled his own stock.\n\nThrough the open window of Pug&#39;s room, Joe saw the stingy financier asleep in bed. Pug had removed his coat, vest and shoes before retiring the night before, though he had neglected to completely disrobe. A short nose and a huge lower jaw had given Pug his name. He was an unlovely object as he slept. His mouth was open; his forehead was wrinkled as he tried to keep the morning light from his eyes; he breathed heavily.\n\nThe gruff rumble of traffic wavered and growled in the air. An elevated crashed by a block away. In this mean, crowded section of the city, men lived and died in sordid, half-crumbling buildings.\n\nNo one had noticed Joe as he climbed the fire-escape. If they had seen him, they would not have remembered the fact. People were too busy in the unending struggle to keep alive to bother with gossip, or remembering the movements of their neighbors.\n\nJoe crept softly into the room. He must not awaken Pug, for then there would be an argument, and possibly a fight. Joe did not fear a tussle; battles were an everyday occurrence. A well-used black-jack reposed in Joe&#39;s hip-pocket. It had seen experience, and possibly it would see more.\n\nTo the left of the window in Pug&#39;s room was a small table. Joe was seized with a humorous idea. He drew a stub pencil from his pocket, and looked about for paper. A newspaper slumped upon the floor. With laborious fingers, Joe wrote on the edge of a page, &quot;IOU 5 Little Joe.&quot; He had gained the sobriquet in a crap game, and it was used by everyone.\n\nAs Joe tore the words from the margin of the newspaper, Pug stirred uneasily. Joe halted, and kept still. Apparently, he had suddenly been turned to stone. Not a muscle moved; he held his breath; he was rigid.\n\nAnd then the even breathing began again on the bed. Joe relaxed, and moved toward the sleeping man. He paused and glanced once, swiftly, at the recumbent bootlegger, but Pug made no sound or movement.\n\nA truck ploughed down the street outside, clattering and bumping, and the air hummed with the muffled roar of the ponderously alive city.\n\nIn the small cell-like room a small, squat man thrust his hand cautiously beneath the bed-pillow. His careful, sensitive fingers touched the cold steel of a stiletto. Joe stopped, chilled by the knife&#39;s keen edge. This was not what he sought. Pug&#39;s money was somewhere near his stiletto, though.\n\nPug sighed, and again Joe grew tense. If Pug awoke, he would be in a murderous humor. Joe&#39;s intrusion would not be misunderstood. For Pug would be positive that Joe had come to rob him. Which was correct.\n\nJoe&#39;s stubby fingers fumbled with the end of the pillow-case and then searched within it for the bootlegger&#39;s banknotes. Joe dared not look at Pug, for a steady stare will arouse a sleeping person. And then, a vise closed upon Joe&#39;s windpipe and began to squeeze. His head was forced back by the pressure of a huge, hairy arm. An instant later Pug&#39;s other hand increased the pressure upon Joe&#39;s neck.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nPug Had Been Awake\n\nFrom the moment Joe had entered the room, Pug had been awake. His sleep had been interrupted twice before during the morning. Once when Joe had requested a loan, and later when someone else knocked upon Pug&#39;s door.\n\nPug had awakened the first time with his temper ragged. He had swallowed a large quantity of whiskey the night before while celebrating a lucky escape from revenue officers. So, when Joe came in and tried to borrow five dollars. Pug had been angry. It was damnable that a man whose throat was caked with concrete, whose eyes were pin-points of pain, should be awakened for such a reason. Pug had a grouch, Joe was the first man he had seen; therefore, Joe&#39;s request was declined violently.\n\nRebuffed, and equally angry, Joe had departed, and Pug went back to bed. But the bootlegger could not resume his interrupted slumbers. His tongue tasted unpleasantly, and his forehead was hot and dry. For several moments he tossed uneasily, and then someone else had knocked on the door.\n\nThis time Pug answered by locking the door. The person on the outside announced he wished to enter. Pug told him to go away, whoever he was, and suggested a destination. And, notwithstanding their repeated knockings, he had not opened the door.\n\nWhen Joe had entered from the fire-escape, Pug had been almost asleep. But the tearing of the newspaper had roused him, though he had concealed the fact that he was awake.\n\nAnd, when Joe had neared his money, Pug had been moved to action. He opened Ins eyes and grasped Joe at the same second. A second later Joe leaped backward, dragging Pug from the bed.\n\nJoe snarled, and a wordless oath rasped from between his yellow teeth. He knew that he had been tricked; that Pug had not been caught unaware.\n\nPug sprawled upon the floor; his grip upon Joe&#39;s neck had been broken. But he did not remain recumbent. Flashing upward, Pug uttered a cry of rage and surged forward.\n\nThe small uncarpeted room held few articles of furniture. A small table was perched near the window that looked upon the fire-escape. There was an unpainted, wooden chair tilted underneath the knob of the door. The bed occupied one side of the room.\n\nThough it lacked furniture, the room held sounds and actions. Snarling and swearing, their arms going like piston rods, their fists crashing brutally upon flesh, their bodies bent and tense, the two men gave and took punishment.\n\nPug was the taller, his arms were longer, and his fists cruelly battered his opponent&#39;s body. Then Joe dashed into close quarters, his arms short and crushing, his squat body aflame with hate.\n\nHe was met by a man whose friendship had been violated, whose mood was a mixture of fury and rage. Pug was wiry; huge hands dangled at the ends of his nervously strong arms; he was viciously ferocious. His fingers sank deep into the short, round neck of the man who had come to rob him.\n\nAs they fought, words flowed in a horrible stream from their lips. The argot of the underworld and the frightfully meaningless phrases of their ordinary conversation shot in fierce fragments from them. A moment before, the room had been silent save for the stealthy movements of Joe; now it was filled with hot oaths, the writhing bodies of the two antagonists, and the straining hate of their struggle.\n\nSeizing an opportunity Pug swung the smaller man against the side of the bed, and they toppled prone. Out flashed one long arm, and Pug had the stiletto.\n\nAs the steel flashed above him, Little Joe turned, caught the descending hand and stopped its downward fall. He squirmed, terrified, for death leered from the face above him. With a superhuman effort Joe lifted the taller man with one short massive arm, and pushed him aside. And then, grasping Pug&#39;s hand that held the knife, Joe put his utmost efforts into an effort to force it downward.\n\nIt was a question of strength, and Joe was a trifle the stronger. The tension did not last long; with a swiftly increasing speed the stiletto descended.\n\nPug sank back upon the bed, his eyes filled with ludicrous surprise. Wordlessly, his mouth opened, and his body twitched. The knife remained in its human sheath.\n\nPanic seized Joe, a sudden, overwhelming fear. He tore furiously at the pillow case, grasped the thick bundle of bills, and dashed to the window. Quickly, furtively, he slipped down the fire-escape.\n\nWhen he reached his room, which was directly below Pug&#39;s, Joe had a horrified second. Instinct told him to protect himself; he must not be accused of killing Pug. He must leave his room, leave the building, do something to take suspicion away from himself.\n\nHe caught up a cap, pulled it down on his oblong head, and slipped quietly down the stairs of the cheap rooming house. He reached the sidewalk without seeing anyone. And he turned into a small cigar store instantly.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Shadow of the Electric Chair\n\nTom, the man who ran the cigar store, was thin, with small, kindly, black eyes set in a wrinkled face. He had an eager, talkative way, and he was continually buying new things — a pencil, or a billfold, or one of the innumerable novelties that are sold by street-corner peddlers — and insisting that all of his customers notice and admire his new possession.\n\nJoe slipped into the cigar store, and grunted when Tom spoke to him. At intervals a chill plucked at his scalp and made the hairs rise and waver. His breath was still accelerated from his fierce struggle with Pug, and his body tensed each time he thought of the man he had killed.\n\nPerhaps even now Pug was still faintly breathing. The knife had sunk deep, and had not been removed. Pug had twitched; his feet had stirred upon the floor … no, he was dead now. Lying with a surprised look in his eyes. Maybe Pug had squirmed a bit, or fallen from the bed, but … he was lying quiet now. Looking surprised, but quiet. Joe felt his scalp crawl.\n\nHe had to do something; fix things so he wouldn&#39;t be suspected. He had to do something; plan something. Make Tom think he had been here a long time. Stayed here from ten o&#39;clock until — &quot;Look at this watch,&quot; said Tom, offering a thin, octagon-shaped timepiece for Joe&#39;s approval. &quot;Bought it this morning. Perfect shape. Seventeen jewel. A bargain.&quot;\n\nJoe looked, and then his eyes blurred. The watch was a half-hour slow! A half-hour slow … Joe knew that the time was at least ten-thirty, because he had started for Pug&#39;s room at ten-fifteen. But the watch was a half-hour slow! The hour hand had crossed the figure ten, and the minute hand was at twelve. The watch was running, its second hand was gaily marking off sixtieths of a minute, and — it was a half-hour slow! The watch said ten o&#39;clock.\n\nHere, begging to be used, pleading to be accepted, was an alibi. It was almost too easy. It was being forced upon him. It was too easy. And yet —\n\nJoe took the watch from Tom&#39;s proud hands, and caressed it with trembling fingers. Ten o&#39;clock. A half-hour slow. But Tom should not know that —\n\n&quot;Pretty good watch,&quot; continued Tom, his manner insinuating that the timepiece was an extraordinary and extremely valuable article. &quot;Cost me twenty-five. Worth a hundred. See this lever?&quot; He touched a small gold slide. &quot;That&#39;s the chimes. Listen.&quot;\n\nWhile Joe held the watch, Tom drew out the tiny gold lever. A soft, clear bell rang ten times, slowly.\n\n&quot;Tells time in the dark. Pretty good watch,&quot; said Tom, boastfully.\n\nJoe gripped his jaws together to still the chattering of his teeth. When Tom had worked the lever of the watch, he had thought that perhaps the cigar store man wanted the return of his property. Joe would give the watch back, but he would begin his alibi first. He would make sure that Tom would be positive that he had been in the cigar store at ten o&#39;clock. Too easy? Why, he wanted something easy like this.\n\nPutting the watch to his ear, Joe listened to its clicks. His body prevented Tom from seeing the timepiece. So, when it crashed to the floor, the cigar store clerk was surprised. Joe had deliberately dropped it.\n\nNow! No matter what happened, Tom would now swear that Joe had been in the cigar store at ten o&#39;clock. There remained but one thing to be done: Joe must now arrange that he should be remembered somewhere else at ten-thirty, or later.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll pay for having the watch fixed,&quot; said Joe, picking it up from the floor, and finding that it had stopped. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to drop it.&quot;\n\nHe took Pug&#39;s roll of bills from his pocket, and. peeled off the top one.\n\nTom was distressed; new lines appeared in his wrinkled face.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s the best — &quot; he began.\n\n&quot;You&#39;ve got the money to have it fixed,&quot; Joe interrupted. He was impatient, eager to go elsewhere. &quot;I&#39;ve loafed around here long enough. Think I&#39;ll travel.&quot;\n\nHe started toward the door. He would go to the corner grocery store, and make some mention of the time there. Or to the nearest drug store. Then his alibi would be perfect, bombproof.\n\nHis feet clung to the floor, and he stretched one hand to the counter to steady himself. He felt sick, as though a solar-plexus blow had caught him unawares.\n\nLooking in through the door of the cigar store was a detective.\n\nJoe could tell a &quot;dick&quot; by one swift glance. Just as wild animals know when a man is armed and dangerous, and when he is without a weapon, so Joe could detect those who were dangerous. And the man who peered in the doorway was an officer of the law.\n\nCummings was a huge mountain of a man, ponderously built, blue-eyed and impassive. He saw Joe, and started to enter the store.\n\nFright flowed frigidly through Joe&#39;s veins; he was caught in the grip of a paralyzing fear. Now, while his alibi was in the process of making, would he be caught and held? Would he be arrested? Now, immediately after he had seemed so safe. That alibi had been too easy.\n\n&quot;You live next door,&quot; stated the detective, his enormous body filling the doorway. &quot;Who runs that rooming house?&quot;\n\n&quot;Mrs. Britt.&quot; Joe answered weakly. &quot;She lives two blocks away. What do you — &quot;\n\n&quot;Never mind what I want. Where have you been all morning?&quot;\n\nSullenly Joe said, &quot;Around here. Talking with Tom.&quot;\n\n&quot;Talking with Tom,&quot; Cummings repeated. &quot;Well, you come with me.&quot;\n\nJoe stepped out of the cigar store, feeling the shadow of the electric chair had touched him. He would be questioned, and —\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nI.O.U. 5\n\n&quot;I want to know where Ernest Worth — he&#39;s called Pug — lives in this house,&quot; the detective said, leading the way toward Joe&#39;s home.\n\nLittle beads of sweat appeared upon the squat man&#39;s forehead, and his arms stiffened. He stifled the moan that trembled in his throat. He dared not try and escape from the detective.\n\nThey climbed the uncarpeted silent stairs and paused before Pug&#39;s door.\n\n&quot;Is this the room?&quot; Cummings asked, and Joe nodded wordlessly. &quot;Well, I knocked on this door this morning,&quot; the officer continued, &quot;and got a grunt and a get-out-of-here for an answer.&quot; He rapped upon the door.\n\n&quot;Mrs. Britt, who runs this house, lives two blocks away,&quot; said Joe. If he could get the detective interested elsewhere, perhaps his captor would no longer detain him.\n\n&quot;She&#39;s out,&quot; was the brief reply. &quot;I went down to see her. Now, where is your room?&quot;\n\n&quot;Downstairs.&quot;\n\n&quot;Let me have your key. This fellow Pug is wanted; he has been mixed up in a bootlegging gang that — &quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know anything about it.&quot; Joe broke in.\n\nHe did not want the door to open; he did not want to see Pug, with that surprised expression on his face, lying dead. A spasm of despair fluttered through Joe, his knees shook slightly. &quot;I — I haven&#39;t — had -anything — &quot;\n\nAgain Cummings knocked upon the door …\n\n&quot;Pug growled at me when I was here before,&quot; he said. &quot;This key might not fit — &quot;\n\nIn the midst of his fear Joe had a dazzling idea. He had wanted to go to the grocery store in order to complete his alibi. Why not ask Cummings what time it was?\n\n&quot;Pug goes out for breakfast every morning,&quot; he said. &quot;Got a watch? Let&#39;s see what time — &quot;\n\nThe detective consulted a cheap nickel watch.\n\n&quot;Ten-thirty-five,&quot; he announced. &quot;Pug was here at ten o&#39;clock.&quot;\n\nPerfect! Joe almost screamed with relief. With these words the detective had completed Joe&#39;s alibi. Cummings had roused Pug at ten o&#39;clock; therefore he was alive at that time. Tom&#39;s dropped timepiece would prove that Joe had been in the cigar store at ten o&#39;clock, and the clerk would say that he had chatted with Joe both before and after that time. When he left the cigar store, Joe had departed with Cummings; consequently his actions during the thirty-five minutes were satisfactorily accounted for. He could not be convicted for killing Pug, for his alibi was perfect. Perfect!\n\nThe detective inserted Joe&#39;s key in the door of Pug&#39;s room. Joe fought to control himself; he must appear astonished and appalled, as though he had not anticipated seeing the lifeless body of his friend. There would be a ludicrous expression of surprise on Pug&#39;s face; the bootlegger would be lying on the bed, or on the floor nearby.\n\nThe key fitted the lock on Pug&#39;s door. Joe was sure of this fact, for he had entered by the door on his first visit to Pug that morning. He had made his second visit by way of the fire-escape, because Pug had tilted a chair underneath the doorknob to prevent another visit.\n\nThe detective pushed the door open, shoving the tilted chair to the floor. Joe was alert, ready to be shocked by what they would find. Again a crawling fear squirmed across his scalp. He closed his eyes, fearing to see that limp, sprawled body.\n\nFrom a distance, Cummings&#39;s voice sounded. It was a placid, indifferent voice, quiet and composed.\n\n&quot;Well, I guess Pug has gone out to breakfast,&quot; the detective said calmly.\n\nJoe opened his eyes. He saw a disordered room, the overturned chair, the bedclothes disarranged, but no sign of Pug. There were no splotches on the floor, nor any evidence that a man had been hurt or killed. And the body had disappeared!\n\nThe detective rummaged in a small closet, and discovered an empty bottle underneath some soiled clothes. He held the dark brown bottle aloft. It was empty.\n\n&quot;No evidence of bootlegging here,&quot; he said. &quot;Let&#39;s get out.&quot;\n\nJoe was stupefied. He stood in horrified bewilderment, looking for some trace of the man he had killed. His mouth seemed hollow, and his eyes were huge and full of biting pains. Again and again he stared at the bed, where he had last seen Pug. Nothing there. Nothing. Joe forced himself across the room, and put his hand in the depression in the bed made by Pug when he had dropped back after being knifed. Nothing. Pug was nowhere in the room. And there were no stains upon the floor, nor any evidence that the bootlegger had been killed.\n\n&quot;Come on,&quot; said Cummings, &quot;I&#39;m going to take a look at your room.&quot;\n\nJoe did not reply, but followed the detective from the room and down the stairs. Terror whimpered in the squat man&#39;s mind, horrible fear coursed through his veins and he stumbled as he descended the uncarpeted steps. Even though his alibi was perfect, a premonition seized him. He recalled Pug&#39;s face with its expression of ludicrous surprise.\n\nThe detective stopped and opened Joe&#39;s door. The short, squat man hesitated in the hallway, held motionless by a mysterious dread. Again his frantic mind assured him that his alibi was perfect, that if his actions during the morning were investigated he would not be convicted of murder.\n\nA muffled curse came from Cummings. The word held horror and dismay and astonishment. And an intangible force impelled Joe into his own room where the detective stood.\n\nCummings was staring at the window in. dazed surprise. Joe&#39;s hunted eyes followed the detective&#39;s glance, and — his body snapped into numbness. Pinpricks of biting cold bit into his brain. All his strength vanished from him.\n\nAnd then the short, squat man began to scream. Shriek after shriek came from Joe&#39;s bulging throat, each rising higher and higher. No words issued from his mouth; the sounds were the fear-filled, desperate, horrified screams of a trapped animal that knows it cannot escape.\n\nFor, upon the fire-escape, peering into the room, was Pug! The knife was still imbedded in the bootlegger&#39;s body; it had not been dislodged from the time Joe had forced the stiletto to its mark. Even though Pug had crawled to the window for assistance, had leaned out, and had fallen down the fire-escape to the floor below, the knife had remained implanted in his flesh.\n\nJoe saw the man he had killed; saw Pug looking in through the window. Now, Pug was not ludicrously surprised. Instead, ferocious hate glared from his features, devilish anger stared from his sightless eyes. And in one cold hand Pug held a torn bit of newspaper, which bore the words &quot;IOU 5 Little Joe.&quot;\n\nThere was no need to accuse Joe of the crime; no need to seek for incriminating evidence. His screams had reached a pitch that sounded as though his vocal chords were being torn from his throat by the strain. He proclaimed his guilt in horrible noises. He forgot that his alibi was perfect; forgot everything but Pug&#39;s loathsome, leering face. Joe&#39;s wild screams betrayed him, and Cummings knew that he was in the presence of the man who had killed Pug.\n\nLater, of course, Joe was calmed by opiates, and his confession written down. But the confession, and the bit of newspaper found in Pug&#39;s lifeless hand, was only corroborative evidence. The thing that destroyed Joe&#39;s perfect alibi, that broke down his feeling of safety, and that finally sent him to the electric chair was Pug&#39;s face staring through the window from the fire-escape.\n\n~ The End ~\n"

In some instances the confidence man proceeds upon the theory that the sucker has a little larcency in his makeup, and at other times he uses his victim&#39;s vanity as an aid in separating him from his money.\n\nThe confidence man—the real confidence man—enjoys an enviable reputation in the underworld and is generally looked up to by men and women engaged in minor rackets requiring less mental ability and productive of smaller profits. But the &quot;short con&quot; men as an equal, for they are known chiselers and resort to any racket which might yield them any sum from five dollars upward.\n\nOne popular short-con racket is known as the trick-knife game. This racket has been widely publicized, but it has so many variations that many persons who have read of others being victimized often become victims themselves. This racket is not confined to rural districts; in fact, most of the &quot;knife hustlers&quot; operate in the larger cities. Their &quot;take&quot; is not large, but they believe in a new variation of an old adage to the effect that: &quot;A sucker a day keeps the wolf away.&quot;\n\nLet us follow &quot;Slick&quot; Martin, knife hustler, as he goes about his day&#39;s work … . When Martin seated himself in a chair in a hotel lobby, he had chosen his seat with care. The man occupying the chair next to him, he had learned, was a visiting contractor from a small town upstate. He had not yet ascertained the size of the other&#39;s bank roll, but he was pretty well convinced that it contained at least fifty dollars, and this was about the maximum amount this particular racket would yield.\n\n&quot;Nice weather we&#39;re having,&quot; Slick commented to the man in the other seat.\n\n&quot;Indeed it is,&quot; the out-of-town man replied. &quot;Looks like an early spring.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; Slick agreed, &quot;I&#39;ve noticed in the past few days that there is considerable new building going on in the city.&quot;\n\n&quot;Is that so?&quot; the other asked. &quot;That&#39;s my line; that is, I&#39;m a building contractor. Barber&#39;s the name.&quot;\n\n&quot;Glad to know you, Mr. Barber,&quot; returned Slick, extending his hand. &quot;My name&#39;s Martin. Hardware&#39;s my line. Are you acquainted in the city?&quot;\n\n&quot;Not too well,&quot; answered Barber. &quot;I get in here a couple times a year, but as a rule I don&#39;t get out of the business district.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m pretty well acquainted all over the city,&quot; Slick said. &quot;If you have nothing important to do perhaps you&#39;d like to take a walk about the city. I&#39;d be glad to show you some of the new building being done.&quot;\n\nThe visiting contractor assented, and fifteen or twenty minutes later the two men were walking down a street on the edge of the business district. They paused in front of a lot where excavating had been started. But apparently no work was being done that day, as only one man was there. He was gray-mustached and wore striped overalls. He was writing on a small pad when the two men stopped.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Trick-Knife Game\n\nSlick was explaining to his companion about the building to be erected there, and in gesturing, his hand struck the overalled man&#39;s elbow. The latter turned and regarded Slick over his steel- rimmed glasses.\n\n&quot;Doggone it,&quot; he said reproachfully, &quot;you made me break my pencil.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sorry, Dad,&quot; Slick apologized. &quot;I&#39;ll lend you my knife.&quot;\n\nAs he thrust a hand into his pocket and brought forth a knife, he winked at his companion. He handed it to the old man.\n\n&quot;There you are, Dad,&quot; he said. &quot;Sharpen her up.&quot;\n\nThe old man tugged at the knife blade, but it failed to open.\n\n&quot;Doggone it,&quot; he said, &quot;I can&#39;t open the blamed thing.&quot;\n\n&quot;Let me have it,&quot; Slick said, extending his hand. &quot;It&#39;s very simple,&quot; he said, when the other had handed him the knife. &quot;See there?&quot;\n\nHe opened the knife without any effort, closed it and gave it back to the old man. The latter again failed to open it.\n\n&quot;Let me have it again,&quot; Slick said, apparently a little exasperated. &quot;Now watch me open it. See? I hold it between the thumb and forefinger of my left hand, then raise the blade with the right hand. Just like this.&quot;\n\nHe opened it and again handed it to the old man.\n\n&quot;Now,&quot; he asked, &quot;do you think you can open it?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve never seen anything yet I couldn&#39;t do,&quot; the old man said testily, &quot;once I&#39;ve seen how it&#39;s done.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, then,&quot; Slick offered, &quot;I&#39;ll bet you a cigar you can&#39;t open that knife in two minutes.&quot;\n\nThe old man looked at Slick, then at the knife.\n\n&quot;Mister,&quot; he said, &quot;I ain&#39;t what you&#39;d call a gambling man, but I&#39;ll just take you up on that. I&#39;ll bet you a cigar I can open that knife in two minutes. A nickel cigar,&quot; he added.\n\n&quot;Okay,&quot; Slick smiled, pulling out his watch, &quot;go ahead.&quot;\n\nThe old man pulled and tugged at the knife blade, but it refused to budge. He placed the knife between his knees and pulled, but he had no success.\n\n&quot;Time&#39;s up,&quot; Slick called. &quot;In fact, I gave you ten seconds over two minutes.&quot;\n\nThe old man relinquished the knife.\n\n&quot;First knife I ever see that I couldn&#39;t open,&quot; he said. &quot;You wait right here, and I&#39;ll go across the street and buy you a cigar—a nickel one.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, let it go, Dad,&quot; Slick said.\n\n&quot;Nosiree,&quot; the old man returned. &quot;When I lose, I pay.&quot;\n\nHe walked across the street and entered a cigar store. Slick turned to his companion.\n\n&quot;I guess losing that nickel cigar just about broke his heart,&quot; he laughed. &quot;And I don&#39;t suppose he has tumbled yet that it&#39;s a trick knife. Did you see how I opened it?&quot;\n\n&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Barber answered. &quot;Here,&quot; Slick explained, holding the knife in his hand. &quot;You see that little round piece of nickel on the end of the knife. It looks like a rivet, but you have to push on it or you can&#39;t open the knife. Try it.&quot;\n\nThe contractor accepted the knife and opened it without difficulty.\n\n&quot;Pretty clever,&quot; he said, returning it.\n\n&quot;When the old fellow comes back,&quot; Slick suggested, &quot;you try to get him to bet you that you can&#39;t open it. Maybe you can win one of his nickel cigars.&quot;\n\nThe contractor chuckled. &quot;I&#39;ll try it,&quot; he promised.\n\nThe old man returned and extended a cigar to Slick.\n\n&quot;There you are, mister,&quot; he said, &quot;the best five-cent cigar in town. Now, would you mind letting me see that knife again?&quot;\n\n&quot;Not at all,&quot; Slick replied, handing him the knife.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Sucker A Day Keeps The Wolf Away\n\nThe old man pulled gingerly at the blade, then turned the knife over and over in his hand carefully, wonderingly.\n\n&quot;That sure is very peculiar,&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;You don&#39;t catch on very quick, do you, Dad?&quot; the contractor asked.\n\nThe old man raised his head quickly.\n\n&quot;I suppose you think you can open it,&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;Why, yes,&quot; the contractor returned, &quot;I believe I can.&quot;\n\n&quot;For how much?&quot; the old man depended.\n\nThe contractor&#39;s eyes twinkled.\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;for a good nickel cigar, anyway.&quot;\n\n&quot;If you&#39;re so much smarter than I am,&quot; the old man snapped, &quot;why don&#39;t you bet something?&quot;\n\nHe closed his fist on the knife and struck the palm of his other hand.\n\n&quot;By golly,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;I&#39;ll bet you fifty dollars you can&#39;t open that knife in two minutes.&quot;\n\nThe contractor hesitated, but Slick nudged him with an elbow.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll just take you up on that,&quot; the contractor said.\n\nThe old man handed the knife to Slick and pulled out a worn billfold. He extracted two twenty-dollar bills and a ten and started to give them to Slick as stakeholder, but he pulled his hand back.\n\n&quot;Say,&quot; he said, &quot;did you show this fellow how to open this knife?&quot;\n\n&quot;He hasn&#39;t seen any more than you have,&quot; Slick assured him. &quot;You saw me open it at the same time he did.&quot;\n\n&quot;All right, then,&quot; the old man said, passing the money to Slick. &quot;You hold stakes, and if he don&#39;t open the knife in two minutes I win. Is that right?&quot;\n\nThe contractor nodded and placed fifty dollars in Slick&#39;s hand. The old man pulled out an old-fashioned watch, and at his command, the contractor began tugging at the blade. His fingers pressed on the little nickel button until his knuckles were white, but the blade did not yield. He glanced helplessly at Slick, but the latter had his eyes on his watch, apparently checking the time with the old man.\n\n&quot;Time&#39;s up!&quot; the old man shouted gleefully. &quot;I even gave you a few seconds over.&quot; He turned to Slick. &quot;I&#39;ll take the money, mister,&quot; he said, &quot;and I hope you enjoy that cigar.&quot;\n\nSlick handed him the money without a word, and the old man walked away chuckling to himself. Apparently he was no longer interested in sharpening his pencil or in the notes he had apparently been making when the two men first appeared on the scene. The contractor was still fumbling with the knife.\n\n&quot;Give me that,&quot; Slick snapped, snatching the knife from the other&#39;s hands. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you do as I told you?&quot; he demanded, knocking the knife against the palm of his hand. &quot;Instead of doing this?&quot; He imitated the other&#39;s futile efforts. &quot;You were yanking and pulling on that blade,&quot; he went on, &quot;like it was hard to open. All you had to do was press gently on this little button and pull the blade open. Now do it.&quot;\n\nThe contractor followed instructions and the knife opened easily. He handed it back to Slick.\n\n&quot;I guess I don&#39;t catch on very quick,&quot; he said.\n\nSlick dropped the knife in a pocket. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I guess that&#39;s one time a working man got the best of a contractor, and fifty dollars will buy a lot of nickel cigars.&quot;\n\nThat night Slick Martin and the old man, who was no longer overalled, were talking in the latter&#39;s room.\n\n&quot;Doggone if I wasn&#39;t afraid,&quot; the old man chuckled, &quot;the way that fellow was manhandling that knife, that he would dislodge the &#39;gimmick&#39;.&quot;\n\n&quot;Not a chance,&quot; Slick smiled. &quot;When you once knock that knife on your hand, and that little shot slips behind the spring, it&#39;ll take another sharp blow to release it. Oh, well,&quot; he yawned, &quot;a sucker a day keeps the wolf away.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n"

The night sounds of the city drifted up to him faintly. There was a cigarette between his fingers.\n\nHe had been sitting there a long time. It hurt him to move, so he was very still, trying to think.\n\nOnce he had touched the back of his head where the ache was. He had felt hair matted with drying, caked blood. His fingers had come away sticky. The pain started there and coursed down between his shoulder blades with steady, dull throbs.\n\nHe sucked on the cigarette until it was limp, trying not to think of the pain, trying to remember … .\n\nHe had stumbled off the bed a half hour ago in a blind fog of pain. His groping fingers had located a light switch. He had looked once around the cheap, dirty hotel room. Then, because the light cut painfully into his burning eyes, he’d snapped it off and sat in darkness.\n\nBut before that? Nothing. Nothing except that one clear picture. He closed his eyes and saw it again in detail.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nAll He Remembered\n\nShe was beautiful, the girl. Her hair framed her pale, sensuous face in a shimmering black pool. She wore a loose satin negligee, black as her hair, dramatic against the milky white translucence of her smooth skin. Her full, sullen lips were parted slightly, showing a line of fine, even teeth. She was staring up at him without blinking.\n\nHe could see himself looking down at her and thinking crazily that he was glad the bullet hole was in her temple so the hair would cover it. So that, even dead, she could go on being beautiful.\n\nHe had bent, straightening the gold locket at her throat because he knew she would have wanted everything perfect.\n\nAnd that was all he remembered. Nothing before. Nothing after. Just the dead girl and this hotel room.\n\nHe finished the last cigarette he had found in a crumpled package in his pocket. He forced himself to stand up and to stay there until the waves of dizziness and nausea passed. Then to walk slowly to the light switch and press it on.\n\nHe kept his eyes closed for a long moment, letting the light filter through his closed eyelids, then slitting them gradually so his eyes grew accustomed to the light.\n\nHe shuffled to the washbasin in a corner of the room, turned the dripping faucet on and sopped cool water on the back of his head. Then he dried his face and hands and stood before the bureau’s cracked mirror.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nClayton City National Bank\n\nHe saw himself for the first time. A strange face that he could not remember. He brought his fingers up, touching his lips, his cheeks. The reflection was that of a thin man in his late twenties. His complexion was pale as if he were seldom in the sunshine. There were dark smudges under his blue eyes, lines around his mouth. His dark brown hair was clipped in a short, crisp style.\n\nHe wore a rumpled sport coat, blue sport shirt and dark slacks. He raised his hands before his eyes, turned them over. They were slender and soft. The hands of an artist, an office worker, a druggist … .\n\nOr a killer?\n\nThe vision of the dead woman flashed before his eyes again. He tried to remember if there had been a gun in his hand.\n\nSuddenly, frantically, he searched his pockets. In the left patch pocket of his sport coat, he found it. A small, nickeled .25 automatic. He pawed at it with shaking fingers. In the firing chamber, there was an empty cartridge shell … .\n\nDully, he sat on the edge of the bed. Then went through the rest of his pockets methodically. He pulled out a wadded handkerchief, a comb, some loose change and a key ring.\n\nIn his billfold he found twenty-two dollars in bills. There were no papers. Only a driver’s license and an empty business envelope addressed to “George Noles” in care of the Clayton City National Bank in Clayton City.\n\nThe name Noles sounded vaguely familiar, but he couldn’t be sure that it was his own.\n\nHe tried to remember Clayton City and working in a bank.\n\n“George Noles.”\n\nHe spoke the name aloud and jumped at the sound of his voice. It was an eerie experience, hearing your own voice for the first time.\n\nHe stood up then and walked out of the room and down the dimly-lit stairway. An old man was dozing behind the hotel desk and he wanted to ask him how he had gotten into the room. But an instinctive fear held him back. If he had killed a woman, the police would be looking for him. He had to find out first who the dead woman was … and if he had killed her … .\n\nThe cheap hotel was on a quiet, narrow street in a deserted part of the city. A few cars were parked at the curb in front. He took the key ring out of his pocket. Attached to it was a tag bearing the license number of a car and the name, “George Noles. Clayton City.” He didn’t recall having come in a car.\n\nHe found a black 1940 model coupe with a license number that corresponded with the number on his key tag. One of the keys unlocked the door and he slid behind the wheel.\n\nThat was when his foot struck the small leather satchel on the floorboards. In the dim glow from the dash-light, he opened it. He stared numbly at the bundles of currency that filled it.\n\nWith shaking fingers he took out one of the bundles. The paper band around it bore the name, “Clayton City National Bank.” There was in the neighborhood of ten thousand dollars in small denominations in the bag … .\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nGood Evening, George\n\nThe highway marker on the city limits of Clayton City said, “Population, 7,000.”\n\nIt was a small, clean town nestling in the hills. A town where life was not hurried and a man could be contented or bored, according to his temperament.\n\nIt had taken George Noles—if that was his name—an hour of fast driving to reach Clayton City after asking directions from a filling station attendant.\n\nNow he drove slowly down Main Street, not knowing what to do next. He told himself he was a fool for coming back here. And yet, suppose he were innocent of any crime. Suppose he had a family here … waiting for him … .\n\nA man lounging in the doorway of a drug store waved as his car passed. “Evening, George,” he called. Noles forced himself to wave back. Now he was at least sure that his name was George Noles and he was from this town.\n\nHe passed the City Library at the end of Main Street. Something, an unconscious reflex, caused him to slow the car. He glanced up at the clock in the courthouse steeple, as if from force of habit. It was ten p.m.\n\n“She’ll be getting off from work, now,” he said suddenly. He stopped the car.\n\nWhy had he said that?\n\nThe words had slipped from his lips automatically, formed somewhere back in the dark, locked chambers of his mind.\n\nHe parked the car. Got out and walked slowly up the wide concrete steps into the modern brick building.\n\nSomehow, even before he pushed through the glass doors, he knew what the librarian would be like. He knew that she would be blonde. That she would be a bit on the thin side. She wouldn’t be exactly pretty, but she would have serious brown eyes and a soft mouth and she would be nice to look at. She would be wearing a freshly starched dress and she would be sorting through her index cards with steady fingers until she glanced up and saw him and then her fingers would freeze.\n\nIt was like that. The color left her face. Her lips moved wordlessly. Then she looked down at her cards, but she wasn’t seeing them now.\n\n“Good—good evening, George,” she whispered with forced evenness.\n\nHe didn’t know how to begin. What did you say? Look Miss, who am I? Have I just killed someone and stolen a large sum of money? Was I running away? Am I a thief and a murderer? Please tell me, Miss. You seem to be someone who might be a friend … who might help … .\n\nNo, you said none of those things. You stood there, groping for words that would not come.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nYou Might Be A Friend\n\nShe looked up again, at his strange silence. She glanced at his eyes, at his rumpled clothes, the blood on his coat collar.\n\nShe paled and her fingers pressed whitely against the card box she was holding. Then quickly, efficiently, she went about the business of closing the library for the night. She locked her desk drawers, snapped the lights off, picked up her handbag. She took his arm, led him swiftly out of the building, down to where his car was parked.\n\nShe seemed to know the car. She got behind the wheel. He leaned against the cushion next to her, weak and spent, letting the night air wash over his sick face and cool the fever in his temples as she drove.\n\nShe didn’t speak, waiting for him to begin it. He found it hard saying anything at all at first.\n\nHe began slowly, searching for the words.\n\n“A little over an hour ago, I woke up in a hotel room in Sanderton. I didn’t know who I was or how I got there. I couldn’t remember my name—nothing. A blow I had gotten on the back of my head seemed to have left me with a kind of amnesia.\n\n“I found a letter in my pocket with my name and this town on it. I drove back here and when I passed the library something seemed to make me stop … to tell me that you might be a friend … .”\n\nIn the darkness, her eyes were filled with many things. Incredulity, shock, pity … and something else.\n\n“Let’s — let’s say we were once friends, George,” she whispered. “I—yes, I’ll help you if I can.”\n\nHe felt a growing dread of the truth he was trying to uncover. He felt that when he broke the dam that locked his past, a flood of evilness would wash his soul straight to hell.\n\n“I—I don’t know your name.”\n\nHer voice was half a sob. “Mary. It’s Mary, George. You can’t—remember anything?”\n\n“It’s like dim shadows on a wall. There—there was a girl. Very dark. Beautiful… .”\n\n“Her name is Liss, George. Liss Denham.” Her face was like chalk in the darkness.\n\n“Yes. Yes, now I seem to know that.” He glanced at her, hating what he was doing to her and afraid of the knowledge that was slowly coming to him. But unable to stop now. He was walking straight into hell and he couldn’t stop.\n\n“Do—do you think I might have had an argument with her? Do you think I—I might have murdered her?”\n\n“Murder… .” She looked at him, her eyes wide and stricken. “George … I—why do you say….”\n\n“I must see her, Mary. Can you drive me to where she lives?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nNightmare Became Reality\n\nShe nodded wordlessly. She swung the coupe around, into a side street. They drove silently along shadowy lanes and then parked before an apartment building. It was in a quiet, residential part of town.\n\nThe apartment building, an old-fashioned three-story frame affair painted a faded yellow, stood in the middle of the block. He left the blonde girl in the car.\n\nHis sick mind groped vainly for some shred of remembrance as he walked into the dimly-lit vestibule. A typewritten tab on one of the mailboxes told him that Liss Denham occupied apartment 3-A.\n\nHe walked up the carpeted stairway. She did not answer the buzzer. He kept his finger on her doorbell as minutes ticked by. His hands grew sweaty and his stomach cramped with nausea.\n\nHe wished she would answer the door. That she would come out alive and unharmed and he would know the vision of her death was just the delirious dreaming of his sick mind.\n\nBut she did not answer the buzzer.\n\nHe went downstairs and around to the side of the building. There, he found a rusty fire escape. It went up to the third floor, past one of her windows.\n\nHe broke the teeth out of his comb, used the end of it to pry the screen hook loose. The window was not locked. He eased it up noiselessly, swung his legs into the room. Then he groped for the light switch.\n\nHe found her in the living room … .\n\nIt was exactly as his mind had pictured it. The small, cramped room with old-fashioned furnishings. The green and yellow flowered wallpaper that clashed with the red drapes. The parchment shade floor lamp spilling its light on the girl sprawled beneath it.\n\nOnly, she wasn’t so pretty any more. Her face was waxen and pinched and her mouth was twisted in a grimace….\n\nThe nightmare had become a reality. The gates of hell had swung wide now and he was walking right into them.\n\nGet away from here, George Notes, a thousand voices screamed in his mind. Take the ten thousand dollars and the car and don’t stop driving until you’re in South America.\n\nDon’t pry any more. Leave the past alone. It’s better that you don’t know who George Noles is or where the money came from or who Mary is or why this girl is dead … .\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nMy Sister\n\nUnconsciously, his hand had taken the .25 automatic from his pocket. He was staring at it and at the girl … his mind sick and reeling. So absorbed that he did not hear the key turn in the hall door or the padded footsteps behind him.\n\nHe jumped when the voice said, “Drop the gun, Noles.”\n\nSlowly he turned, lifting his hands.\n\nThe man standing there was short and stocky. He wore a wrinkled seersucker suit, tan-and-white shoes, a blue tie. His face was bland, expressionless.\n\nEverything about him was neat, precise: his short, clipped mustache, his thinning strands of brown hair carefully slicked over his shiny scalp … the way his soft, fat white hand held a revolver pointed steadily at Noles’ stomach. He might have been a professional man, a doctor, lawyer, or a bank president.\n\n“So you killed her,” he said, his voice shaking. “I warned Liss. Don’t trust that hick Noles too much. He isn’t as dumb as he looks, I told her.”\n\nNoles licked his lips. “Listen … .”\n\n“I can see how it was,” the man went on, trembling now. “You decided it would be nicer to have the whole fifty thousand … better than having Liss. She planned it all for you. You wouldn’t have had brains enough to open a tin piggy bank. But once you had the money, you started thinking a little under your own power. How simple it would be, you know, to have it all for yourself. So you killed her, you rotten hick … ”\n\n“No,” Noles cried. “Listen, I don’t know who you are or who this woman is. I—I don’t even know who I am. I woke up in a hotel room less than two hours ago, sixty miles from here. I had been struck on the back of the head. I couldn’t remember how I got there or anything before I woke up. All I could remember was this woman lying in this room. But I couldn’t have killed her … . I’m not a murderer.”\n\nThe man’s eyes narrowed.\n\n“The old insanity business, Noles? It won’t work, Noles. Maybe with the police, not with me. Liss was my sister. I have more of a personal interest than the police … .\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nHad He Really Killed Her?\n\nHis pudgy white finger closed around the trigger.\n\n“I’ll tell them you tried to kill me. That I caught you in the act of murdering Liss and you turned on me. I fired in self-defense. He raised the gun. His lips curled. “The town will believe anything of you!”\n\nThere it was again. What sort of man had George Noles been? What evil sickness had ruined him? Had it been this woman, Liss Denham?\n\n“Wait,” Noles cried desperately. “I don’t know anything about any fifty thousand dollars. But I can prove I wasn’t taking that much money. Down in my car there is a satchel. There couldn’t be more than ten thousand dollars in it.\n\nThe man shrugged that off.\n\n“So you’ve hidden part of it. I’d hardly expect you to carry fifty thousand dollars in small bills around with you.”\n\nNoles’ sick mind raced against time. He had to know all of it now. He had learned that his name was George Noles and that he had worked for the Clayton City National Bank.\n\nApparently Liss Denham had talked him into stealing fifty thousand dollars from the bank which they were to share. But what sort of power had she had over him? He must have loved her with an intensity that stopped at nothing.\n\nThen had he really killed her? If he had loved her that desperately, he might have killed her out of jealousy. Or perhaps he had wanted the money more than the woman. He could have struck his head in a fall, running away from the apartment.\n\nLiss Denham’s brother raised the gun again. It would take him about two seconds to pull the trigger and send a bullet crashing into Noles’ heart.\n\nHis mind went back to that remembered vision of this room and the dead Liss Denham.\n\nOnce again, he saw the clear details. He saw himself kneeling beside the dead girl and arranging her locket. A foolish gesture … arranging her locket!\n\nThe thought crashed in his mind like cymbals.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nThe Head-Strong Type\n\nAt that precise moment, the hallway door in the other room opened. There was the hurried tap of a woman’s heels and the blonde girl, Mary called, “George? I got worried. You have been here so long … .”\n\nShe stood frozen in the doorway. Her eyes were on the dead Liss Denham, her face a mask of stunned horror.\n\nIn that brief instant, Liss Denham’s brother flicked his eyes in her direction and George Noles leaped. Every movement sent racking pain through his head. He flung himself on the short, balding man, hurling him back.\n\nThey crashed into the wall, Noles’ shoulder ramming into Denham’s stomach. He got his hands on the man’s pudgy wrist and he twisted the gun loose. Kicked it across the room, then ducked after it, scooped it up.\n\nDenham had half slid down the wall, clutching his middle, his eyes rolling, face contorted as he gasped for breath.\n\nNoles waited until Denham got his breath back.\n\n“Now tell me all of it,” Noles said. “Start from when I met your sister. You see, I wasn’t lying when I said I don’t know anything that happened before two hours ago.”\n\nDenham looked at the blonde girl, his lips curling. “Want her to hear it?”\n\nNoles hesitated, looking at her.\n\nHer brown eyes were dark smudges in her white face. “I—I guess I already know most of it,” she said.\n\nThen Denham talked in quick, short sentences. When he had finished, George Noles knew all of it. It wasn’t pretty.\n\nLiss Denham and her brother, Avery, had moved to Clayton City six months ago. She’d visited the bank several times and Noles struck up an acquaintance. Soon he was infatuated with her.\n\nHe used all his personal savings, trying to keep up with her expensive tastes. Then she’d talked him into taking this money from the bank vault. With his knowledge of the bank procedure it had not been difficult. He had stolen the money tonight.\n\nDenham finished, “I tried to talk Liss out of this but she was always the head-strong type. And tonight you killed her. But you won’t get away with it, Noles … .\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nYou Killed Your Wife\n\nGeorge Noles shook his head. “That isn’t all of it. You see there was one detail. The one thing I could remember clearly when I came to back in Sanderton, was this room. I saw Liss just as she’s lying here and that was when someone struck me from behind.\n\n“The last thing I did before that person hit me, was to straighten a little gold locket Liss always wore at her throat.” He nodded at the body.\n\n“But you see, it’s gone now. Someone has been in here since that time. Someone who removed the locket, but did not report the murder, for good reason.”\n\nHe moved toward Denham step by step. “I don’t think I killed Liss Denham. I don’t think it at all any more.” He stood before Denham. He ran one hand over the other man’s pockets in a quick motion.\n\nDenham began sweating. Little beads of it stood out on his lips. His eyes flitted like a trapped animal’s.\n\nNoles found the locket in Denham’s vest pocket. He snapped it open. Inside were pictures of Liss and Avery Denham and a fine engraving that read, “To Liss – from her husband, Avery”\n\n“You killed your wife, Denham,” George Noles said. “I must have come in and found her right after you did it. You hit me on the back of my head, planted the gun on me, took the locket off, then drove me to the hotel in Sanderton, left part of the money in my car and put me in a hotel room, hoping I’d be so frightened when I came too, that I’d run with what money I had. The police would naturally connect the theft with the murder.”\n\nAvery Denham panted, “That doesn’t prove anything. Just because she was my wife doesn’t prove I killed her!”\n\n“The police have something called the ‘paraffin test.’ With it, they can tell which one of us fired a gun tonight. I’m willing to take the test. Are you, Denham?”\n\nHe reached for the telephone.\n\nDenham’s breath was coming in short, ragged gasps. His shirt was soggy with perspiration. A dark ring of it had soaked through under the arms of his seersucker coat.\n\n“She was going to leave me,” he whimpered. “The way it was planned, she was to get you hooked, talk you into stealing the money. Then we were to take all of the money and ditch you. But, damn her, she fell for you, and I’d rather have her dead than for someone else to get her … .”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 11\n\nWho Are You, Mary?\n\nGeorge Noles sat on the sofa with the blonde girl while they waited for the police. There was no fight left in Denham—slumped in a chair opposite them.\n\nDenham had hidden all but the ten thousand dollars he had planted on Noles, but they would find that and give it back to the bank. Perhaps, Noles thought, they wouldn’t be too hard on him.\n\nGradually, his mind was clearing now, and he could remember scenes from this town. Shady lanes and the quiet, friendly laughter of neighbors. He could even remember walking to church on Sundays beside this slim, blonde girl, Mary.\n\n“I—I may have to go to prison for a while. When I come back, I wonder if I might see you now and then,” he asked haltingly.\n\nHer eyes were filled with that strange look … and with tears. She looked away from him.\n\n“Per—perhaps, George. We’ll see.”\n\n“Who are you, Mary? What were you to me?”\n\nShe started to speak, but didn’t. She had been dead inside for so long now, she couldn’t trust herself with emotions. She’d tell him later … or perhaps his mind would clear and he would remember … that she was his wife … .\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

I swear I didn’t kill him!”\n\nFoxy Lee’s rattish face was grey with fright. It was quiet in the interview room at Wandsworth Jail, and the little crook’s voice roused strange echoes.\n\n“He was dead when I broke in!” Foxy went on, beads of perspiration gathering on his forehead.\n\n“I told the truth to the inspector. I didn’t kill Michael Martin!”\n\n“Take it easy,” Dixon Hawke said. “I’ll help you if I can, but the evidence against you is pretty black.”\n\nThe famous criminologist had been called to the jail by the personal appeal of the prisoner, who was well known to him. Foxy was a crook, but a second-rater. He had carried out small robberies, but had never committed any crime of much magnitude.\n\nAnd now he was charged with murder —charged with the death of Michael Martin, and with enough evidence against him to hang a dozen men. They had found his fingerprints on the pistol by the side of the body. They had found his jemmy and other tools scattered on the floor. And Foxy had made a confession of breaking in with intent to rob.\n\n“But I didn’t kill the cove!” ho whimpered. “I tell you what happened, Mr. Hawke. I lifted a window and went in. There was just one light in the room, and that was shaded. I saw a pistol on the floor, and picked it up. Then I saw the—the body! I dropped the pistol and done a bolt!”\n\n“Sure, Foxy?”\n\n“Every word’s true. They’ll ’ang me if you don’t do something! I didn’t kill him! I didn’t!”\n\nThe criminologist looked at the little man. If Foxy was acting the part of an innocent man, he was certainly doing it cleverly.\n\n“You’re as crooked as they’re made,” the criminologist said, “but I don’t think you’d do murder. I’ll try my best to get you out of this mess.”\n\n“Bless you, Mr. ’Awke. You’re a real gent—straight! –Not like that inspector, who don’t care nothing so long as he gets the rope round my neck!”\n\n“That’s enough!” growled Inspector Meadows, the C.I.D. officer responsible for the arrest. “I don’t want to see an innocent man hanged, but I think we’ve got the right chap in you!”\n\nThe warder came to take Foxy away. Dixon Hawke and the inspector left the jail. The latter was half-defiant as they entered the car which had brought them to Wandsworth.\n\n“They don’t call him Foxy without reason,” he suggested.\n\n“Oh, he’s clever, Meadows, but there are some queer facts in this case to be studied.”\n\n“Meaning?”\n\n“The weapon that killed Martin, for example.”\n\n“It was a duelling pistol. Martin had many queer things in his house. His real name, by the way, was Micha Martinez. He came originally from Moravia, and was naturalised as a British subject five years ago.”\n\n“A curious character, I believe. I’d very much like to see the room where he was killed.”\n\n“I have the keys to the house in my pocket. We’ve removed the body for the inquest, but everything else is as the housekeeper found it.”\n\n“She was away the night of the crime?”\n\n“Her master had sent her away over the week-end, and he was alone in the place.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Bullet in the Wall\n\nThe house was midway between Hampstead and Golders Green, standing at the edge of the wide heath. Inspector Meadow’s unlocked the doors and showed the way to the room where Martin had been killed.\n\nIt was an enormous room, dating back to the spacious days of the Victorians. The length was over fifty feet, and it was a good twenty wide. A thick carpet was underfoot, and the walls were hung with rich tapestries. The furniture was somewhat disarranged and moved back from the centre of the room.\n\n“We found it like this,” Meadows said. “I don’t quite understand what Martin had been up to.”\n\n“Where was he lying?”\n\n“Over there by the window. The curtains were drawn, and the lamp near the fireplace turned on. The bullet had caught him above the heart.”\n\n“A duelling pistol, you say?”\n\n“Ho has a collection of them. I think he must have been loading the weapon when Foxy came in. Possibly there was a struggle. The weapon was fired from a good forty feet, so I think Foxy had taken it from him and was making for the door when he lost his nerve and pulled the trigger.”\n\n“But you found the pistol near the body r\n\n“Our man probably put it there in the hope the thing would look like suicide–”\n\n“In that case why did he leave his housebreaking tools scattered on the floor?”\n\nInspector Meadows grunted, but did not answer. Hawke turned away, and began a careful search of the room. First, he examined the case containing the collection of pistols. They were all there except the one that had been found with the body.\n\nOne by one he picked them up. The pistols smelt of oil, and were in excellent condition. A number of bullets were in the collection.\n\nThe bullets were round, and cast with all the care of the old-time gunsmith. For a long time the criminologist stood examining the case.\n\n“There are spaces for twelve bullets,” he said at last. “Did you notice that two were missing?”\n\n“We found one in Martin.”\n\n“And the other?”\n\n“It was probably lost long ago.” Hawke took one of the pistols. Slowly he moved to the chalk marks on the floor which showed the position in which the dead man had been found. He turned and faced the length of the room, raising his arm with the pistol extended.\n\nHis eye was keen as he looked along the barrel. The weapon poised with exquisite balance. Hawke could see the tapestry-hung wall beyond the foresight.\n\nThe design of the hanging represented a pastoral scene. A goatherd played his pipes and a young kid skipped in the background. There was a tree with birds flying in and out of the foliage. Something queer about one of those birds, the investigator noticed.\n\nAnd then a cry of astonishment burst from Hawke’s lips.\n\n“The other bullet! ” he said.\n\nHurrying across the room he put a chair against the wall and climbed on to it. Carefully he moved the tapestry, and a shower of fine plaster fell from behind it. He began to dig with the blade of a knife, and presently a rounded lump of lead was in his hand.\n\n“How do you explain it?” he asked Meadows. “Did Martin have two pistols loaded and fire one at Foxy?”\n\n“I’m blessed if I know! ” The C.I.D. officer was mortified at the discovery of the bullet. “I searched thoroughly,” he added, “but I didn’t think of looking in that wall.”\n\n“The angle of the shot was upward. Even if Martin had been lying on the floor ho couldn’t have put the ball where I found it. Something deflected it.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“You can see faint stains on the lead. I notice spots on the carpet redder than the dye. If you have a test made, I am sure you will find traces of human blood 1 ”\n\n“But there’s no mark on Foxy! ”\n\n“Quite—and I’m ready to bet that the little crook is innocent 1 ”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Visitor from Moravia\n\nThe second bullet was a valuable clue, but at that the new line of investigation was halted. It had already been established that nobody had hoard the firing of the shots. The house stood alone at the edge of the heath and it was easy to enter or leave the place without being seen.\n\nStanding in front of a cabinet, the criminologist looked at some photographs in silver frames. He picked up one which showed a group of officers in the smart uniforms of the Moravian Army. Meadows crossed to Hawke’s side and looked over his shoulder at the photograph.\n\n“Martin is the one on the left,” ho volunteered. “Before he came to this country he was an officer in the Royal Guard.”\n\n“And the man whose arm is linked in his is General Riccardo Pablo,” supplemented Hawke. “I saw his photograph in the papers a few days ago when he came here with a military mission. I wonder what caused Martinez to give up such a fine career and change his nationality?”\n\n“I don’t know, Hawke—and it will be almost impossible to find out,” said Inspector Meadows.\n\n“I’ll look into that myself. I’ll be glad, by the way, if you will have the two bullets and the collection of duelling pistols examined by an expert. You can got that done quickly?” rapped Hawke.\n\n“Certainly. What do you expect to find out?” asked the inspector, feeling more curious than ever.\n\n“That the bullets were fired from different pistols! That one of the weapons in the case has been recently cleaned and oiled!” announced Hawke, his eyes glittering with excitement.\n\nInspector Meadows blinked in astonishment. He was bewildered by the rapid developments in what had appeared to be a simple case. The officer shook his head as he went to the telephone and called Scotland Yard. Hawke’s strange requests were to be satisfied.\n\nLeaving the scene of the tragedy, the criminologist returned to his Dover Street chambers. He ordered his assistant, Tommy Burke, to bring him the files of newspapers for the past three days.\n\nThe journals came from all parts of Europe, those of Paris and Berlin arriving at Dover Street on the day of publication. Hawke knew several languages, and gleaned valuable information from his study of the foreign press.\n\nAn English paper reported the arrival of the Moravian military mission, headed by General Pablo. Its business had been quickly accomplished, but the officers had stayed for various entertainments arranged for them.\n\n“Moravia was represented at Aider—shot by Colonel Battisti,” Hawke read. “General Pablo flew to Paris unexpectedly this morning. No explanation has been given for his sudden departure, but he is not expected to return.”\n\nThe date of the paper was the previous day, an early evening edition. The criminologist then turned to the French file and worked through the columns of the “Paris Soir,” the popular newspaper of that city. He found what he was looking for on an inside page.\n\n“General Pablo, of Moravia, who has been in England, arrived by air at Le Bourget this afternoon. His visit was unexpected, and there was no reception. He left in a closed car for the Hotel du Roi”\n\nIn the “Matin ” of that morning’s date there was another brief paragraph.\n\n“General Pablo is confined to his apartment at the Hotel du Roi by a bad chill. He is being attended by a doctor from the Moravian Embassy.”\n\nHawke cut out the paragraphs and put them in his wallet. He spent some time walking up and down the room, his usually pale cheeks flushed with excitement. When the telephone rang in the other room he reached the instrument before Tommy Burke could lift the receiver.\n\nInspector Meadows was on the wire. The C.I.D. man was excited. He could hardly control himself as he reported the findings of the firearms expert at Scotland Yard.\n\n“You must be a wizard, Hawke! The bullet you found in the wall was fired from one of the guns in the collection. It was carefully cleaned and oiled before being put back in the case.”\n\n“Excellent! And do you think Foxy would have thought of that?” asked Hawke.\n\n“I’m blessed if I know! The evidence was all against him a few hours ago, but now he’s got a good defence,” said the inspector.\n\n“What about the stains on the carpet?”\n\n” It’s human blood all right. Somebody was hurt, but it wasn’t Foxy. The thing that puzzles me is this. If two guns were fired, why was the one that killed Martin found by his body and the one he apparently used cleaned and put away?”\n\n“I think the killer planned to clean both guns, but his wound made it necessary for him to leave. Either that, or he was forced to clear off when Foxy arrived,” Hawke suggested.\n\nThen the detective hesitated a moment. Meadows called his name several times before he replied, and then it was with a request as surprising as any he had made.\n\n“Can I have the gun and bullet packed and sent to meet me at Croydon?”\n\n‘‘Croydon? What’s the idea, Hawke?” gasped Inspector Meadows, becoming more and more puzzled.\n\n“I’m taking the plane for Paris,” the criminologist answered. “I need the gun as—as a visiting-card, Meadows. As a visiting card! ”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nAt the Hotel du Roi\n\nTo Dixon Hawke, the French capital was as familiar as London. When the bus from Le Bourget dropped him at the air terminus on the Rue George V’., he strolled slowly along the boulevard to the great Place du Concorde. Under his arm was a small package which he had passed unopened through the Customs with the aid of his Scotland Yard credentials.\n\nFor once the criminologist had no intention of asking for the aid of his French friends in the Sûreté. What he had come to do was entirely unofficial. He hesitated before entering the Hotel du Roi, but finally approached the desk and made an inquiry concerning General Pablo.\n\n“I regret,” said the clerk, “the General does not receive visitors. He is ill.”\n\n“So I read in the papers,” Hawke said. “But it is very important that I sec him.”\n\nThe clerk spoke on the telephone. Shortly afterwards a swarthy man of military appearance stepped from the lift. He introduced himself as the Moravian’s aide-de-camp.\n\n“It is quite impossible,” he said. “The General is confined to his bed with a bad chill. If you will leave your card, perhaps an interview can be arranged later.”\n\n“This is my card,” Hawke said, holding out the flat case under his arm. “If you will give it to the General I’ll wait for his reply. I think he will sec me at once.”\n\nThe young officer bowed and went away. Hawke paced the lobby, his hands gripped behind his back.\n\nSeveral minutes passed and then the clerk called him. He was requested to go up to the General’s apartment. Following the dapper page, he walked down a broad corridor and was admitted to a suite of rooms by the same swarthy aide-de-camp he had met a few minutes previously. There was a look of alarm on the man’s face.\n\n“If you please,” he said, opening the door of an inner room.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Full Confession\n\nIt was a fine room, lighted by the bright evening sky. In a chair near the windows sat a tall and dignified man. He wore a dressing-gown over his pyjamas, and the detective noticed that his left arm was in a sling. As Hawke entered, lie gazed at him intently.\n\n“I am General Pablo,” he said. “You wish to see me? I understand that I am talking to Mr. Dixon Hawke.”\n\n“I regret troubling you, General, but the matter is of some importance,’’ said Hawke grimly.\n\n“So I understand from your—er— visiting-card.”\n\nThe Moravian tapped the open case lying on the table. The pistol and misshapen bullet were open to view.\n\n“Your ‘cards’ are dangerous,” ho said reflectively.\n\n“In some hands. General. Such a * card ’ as this killed Micha Martinez, with whom I believe you were acquainted,” said Hawke.\n\nThe detective looked at the man’s haggard face. It was with difficulty that ho forced the next words from his lips.\n\n“Did he shoot first?” he asked the General.\n\n“Before the clock struck for the signal. He was treacherous to the last! You know all, Mr. Hawke?”\n\n“Most of it. You went to Martinez and challenged him to a duel. The pistols were loaded and you fired from opposite ends of the room. His shot, I gather, struck your shoulder and was deflected upwards to the wall, where I found it. Yours, fired a second later, found his heart.”\n\n“Correct!”\n\n“You started to clean the guns, hoping thereby to bewilder the police, but were interrupted by the arrival of a thief. You dropped the gun you had not cleaned near the body of Martinez, and hid. Afterwards you went away and left for Paris as quickly as possible. And an innocent man is accused of murder! ”\n\nA troubled look showed in the Moravian’s eyes for a moment, and then he pushed a thick envelope towards the accuser. It was addressed to Scotland Yard.\n\n“Full confession,” he said. “I could do nothing else. The reason for the duel I cannot explain in detail. It concerns a lady—five years ago, when Martinez was my brother officer. He was a rat, Mr. Hawke! Is there any need for me to explain? I challenged him, but he ran from Moravia. When I came to London I sought him out and begged him to return to meet me in the proper manner. He refused, and then I saw the pistols. I repeat, he was more than a rat! I have no regrets—except for the man who was blamed for my action ! ”\n\nThe words were spoken with considerable force, and the General sank back weakly in the chair when he had finished. Hawke stood before him, the envelope containing the confession between his fingers. It was a difficult moment.\n\nHe had no reason to doubt the Moravian. The man’s tale of what had happened was perfectly true. Doubtless, too, Martinez had deserved to die.\n\nBut taking the law into one’s hands was a crime in England. General Pablo would be charged with manslaughter, perhaps murder, if the confession was put in the hands of Scotland Yard.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nA Present from Foxy\n\nI will come with you to England if you wish,” the General said.\n\n“Not yet,” Hawke said. He had made up his mind. “I want your word as a soldier that you will not leave this hotel until I wire you permission. I am returning alone. If nothing else can save Foxy Lee, I must give the police your confession.”\n\n“I am at .your orders, Mr. Hawke ! ” The General rose to his feet. He stood at attention while the criminologist went to the door. It was a rare moment for Dixon Hawke, who actually regretted that he had succeeded in unravelling the mystery of the second bullet.\n\nOn his return to England, Hawke called Inspector Meadows at the Yard. The C.I.D. officer was in a cheerful mood, and asked him to come round at once.\n\n“Well,” he said, rubbing his hands, “while you’ve been making mysteries I’ve been solving ’em ! ”\n\n“Solving them. Inspector?”\n\n“You played a big part in it, Hawke. Foxy Lee has been released. It is quite obvious that Martinez shot himself I ”\n\n“Eh?”\n\n“I have discovered he used to practise shooting with his pistols. On the night in question he fired one weapon, and you found the bullet in the wall. He cleaned the gun and put it away. The second weapon went off accidentally and killed him. What do you think of the theory?”\n\nDixon Hawke thrust his hands into his pockets. He felt the thick envelope containing the confession. It was a long time before he spoke.\n\n“Congratulations, Meadows,” ho said.\n\n“So you agree? We’re not so stupid at the Yard, after all, eh? And what about your crazy trip to Paris?”\n\n“It was just a crazy trip! ” Dixon Hawke said quietly.\n\n\n\nSome days later a small package arrived at Dover Street. The criminologist opened it at the breakfast table, and whistled as he took out a valuable tiepin. A scrap of paper, containing a message pencilled in an uneducated hand, was wrapped around it.\n\n“You’re a gent!” he read. “You got me off having my neck stretched. Here’s something to show you my thanks! ”\n\nThe signature was that of Foxy Lee, and Hawke laughed as he examined the pin and then passed it over to his assistant.\n\n“Thanks from the criminal world ! ” he said. “Will you please check this up with the list of stolen property. Tommy? I’m very interested to know whom I must thank for Foxy’s gift!”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

While riding alone into the attractive residential town about dusk one May evening, he was suddenly startled by appalling cries for help from the direction of a narrow road through the wooded country beyond that outskirts of the town.\n\nSheriff Cudworth sprang from his car and ran through the intervening woods and shrubbery. He soon came in view of the sandy road. A girl of nineteen, supporting a younger sister who was very near fainting, both of whom the sheriff knew well, uttered a cry of relief when she saw him approaching.\n\n&quot;Thank Heaven!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Courage, Mabel. Don&#39;t faint. Here&#39;s the sheriff. Oh, Mr. Cudworth, we have been terribly frightened.&#39;&#39;\n\n&quot;Frightened by what, Miss Venner?&quot; he inquired, gazing sharply around.\n\n&quot;That man — that horrible man!&#39;&#39; gasped the younger girl, still cowering close to her sister. &quot;Has he gone. Clara? Has he — &quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, yes, dear, he has gone. I never saw such a frightful — &quot;\n\n&quot;There, there, calm yourselves,&quot; Cudworth kindly interrupted. He was a big, genial man around fifty and very popular in Shelby. &quot;There&#39;s nothing to be afraid of. Where did you see the man? What sort of a fellow was he?&quot;\n\n&quot;Frightful!&quot; Clara Yenner repeated. &quot;He came through the shrubbery over there and stood staring at us. We were afraid he was going to attack us. His eyes were like balls of fire. He was as green as grass.&quot;\n\n&quot;Green!&quot; Cudworth echoed. &quot;Do you mean he was a rube, a countryman?&quot;\n\n&quot;No, no, not at all,&quot; Clara exclaimed. &quot;I mean his color. He was bright green from head to foot.&quot;\n\n&quot;Nonsense!&quot; Cudworth laughed. &quot;Who ever heard of a green man? That&#39;s absurd. You aren&#39;t color blind, are you?&quot;\n\n&quot;We aren&#39;t both color blind,&quot; said Mabel, hastening to corroborate her sister. &quot;The man was green, Mr. Cudworth, nearly as green as grass. I saw him plainly. He was horrible. A half-clad, gigantic — &quot;\n\n&quot;No, no, Mabel, not gigantic,&quot; Clara interrupted more calmly. &quot;Don&#39;t exaggerate. He was appalling enough without that. He was quite tall, Mr. Cudworth, but not uncommonly large. Mabel was so frightened that he looked to her like a giant.&quot;\n\n&quot;How was he dressed?&quot; asked the sheriff, scarcely able to credit the strange story.\n\n&quot;He wore shabby gray trousers and a flannel shirt, both very much soiled, and a tattered felt hat. He had no coat or vest. His shirt was partly unbuttoned, exposing his neck and breast. They were a striking shade of green, Mr. Cudworth, like his hands and face. I think he must be that color from head to foot. This sounds incredible, I know, but it&#39;s absolutely true,&quot; Clara Venner earnestly insisted. &quot;He looked like a crazy man, a maniac. I never saw such a shocking — &quot;\n\n&quot;Stop a moment,&quot; Cudworth interrupted. &quot;There comes Doctor Wykoff. He also has seen this mysterious green man, perhaps, judging from the speed with which he is riding.&quot;\n\nDoctor Alexis Wykoff was a prominent Shelby physician. He had more than a local reputation, too, due to his frequent contributions to the leading medical journals, to his discovery of a valuable vaccine, to his successful experiments with electricity as a curative agent, and to his profound and practical knowledge of botany and chemistry, having for years spent half his time in a well-equipped laboratory in the grounds of his estate. He was a well-built, impressive man of forty-five, with a strong and somewhat austere face, smooth shaven, with a very dark complexion and heavy brows. They were knit with a frown over his dark eyes when, mounted on a powerful roan horse, he approached in a cloud of dust through the woodland road and stopped near the sheriff and his companions.\n\n&quot;Well, well, what&#39;s wrong, Cudworth?&quot; he inquired familiarly, evidently somewhat excited. &quot;Good evening, young ladies. What&#39;s the trouble, sheriff?&quot;\n\n&quot;Something more singular than seriously wrong, doctor, I imagine.&quot; Cudworth eyed him a bit curiously. &quot;What led you to think there was any trouble?&quot;\n\n&quot;I heard screams and cries for help, or thought I did,&quot; said the physician. &quot;I came to find out what caused them.&quot;\n\n&quot;You heard them, Doctor Wykoff, all right,&quot; Cudworth told him. &quot;These girls were badly frightened by some fellow, either a lunatic or the good Lord knows what, who has stained himself grass green and — &quot;\n\n&quot;Grass green!&quot; Doctor Wykoff exclaimed, interrupting. &quot;Incredible!\n\n&quot;Where did you see him, Miss Venner?&quot; He turned abruptly to the elder girl. &quot;What was he doing? Where did he go?&quot;\n\n&quot;He ran in that direction when we began to scream,&quot; said Clara, pointing into the woods. &quot;He appeared like a wild man, Doctor Wykoff, and vanished as quickly as he came.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll look for his footprints,&quot; Cudworth remarked. &quot;I don&#39;t think, however, that we could trace him.&quot;\n\nDoctor Wykoff dismounted and followed him, while the girls remained by the side of the road. The sheriff soon found several footprints in the damp earth under the shrubbery, one of which he carefully measured while telling the physician more precisely wrhat the two girls had stated.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t take much stock in it,&quot; he quietly added. &quot;There was a man here, no doubt, but I guess the green stuff was an optical illusion. They were deceived in the dusk, or got their absurd impression in some way from the surrounding foliage. There&#39;s no lunatic asylum near here from which an inmate has escaped, and surely no sane man would stain himself bright green.&quot;\n\n&quot;He&#39;d be a bird,&quot; Doctor Wykoff said dryly.\n\n&quot;Bird is right,&quot; Cudworth muttered.\n\n&quot;That really is your opinion, sheriff, is it?&quot; Doctor Wykoff inquired casually.\n\n&quot;Certainly.&quot; Cudworth paused and nodded. &quot;Have you any other ?&quot;\n\n&quot;None whatever,&quot; said the physician. He turned to remount his horse. &quot;I&#39;ll ride on a bit, nevertheless, and try to find the fellow. If I succeed — &quot;\n\n&quot;Grab him and bring him to me,&quot; Cudworth interrupted. &quot;Take it from me, doctor. I&#39;ll put him through a laundry that will wash the green off him. The girls still are nervous. I&#39;ll take them home in my car.&quot;\n\nBut it is doubtful if Doctor Wykoff heard the last, for he was already riding away at top speed.\n\nSheriff Cudworth was not deeply impressed. He did not think the incident of serious importance. He decided that the Venner girls were mistaken, that in their sudden excitement both had received a wrong impression of the unknown man, whom they had seen only for a moment in the twilight. That he was really green seemed too extraordinary, too absurd and fantastical, for serious consideration.\n\nBut Sheriff Cudworth soon changed his mind. Other persons saw the mysterious green man. They confirmed the statements of the Venner girls. None had more than a brief glimpse of him, however, always in some part of the woods, into the depths of which he fled when discovered, uttering wild, discordant cries and making fierce gesticulations. Children playing in the woods caught sight of him and ran home in frantic terror. Petty thefts soon were reported. Footprints identical with that measured by the sheriff were found in back yards and alleys. The marauder was prowling into the town by night. Women became alarmed and dared not venture out. Doors and windows were kept securely locked. Men who never had owned a weapon, and who scarcely dared to fire one, bought guns, revolvers, and pistols. All efforts to trace and capture the &quot;green man&quot; were proving futile.\n\nShelby was becoming terrorized. The report went abroad that in the woods was a dangerous madman, a green maniac, whom the police could not capture. Sheriff Cudworth found himself with his reputation at stake and his official head in danger.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s got to be done! I&#39;ve got to get that green guy, by thunder, if I lose a leg,&quot; he told himself.\n\nSheriff Cudworth was alone late that evening in his office on the ground floor of the county court house. He had been detained by a storm, which still was raging. Vivid lightning flashes illumined the two uncurtained windows behind him, while he sat at his desk and tried to solve the exasperating problem.\n\n&quot;This alleged green man can&#39;t be any different from other men,&quot; Cudworth grimly reasoned. He did not pretend to be an expert detective, but he had plenty of good common sense. &quot;There must be some natural cause for his extraordinary color. He can&#39;t be simply perpetrating a hoax. He wouldn&#39;t prolong it day and night for two weeks. Furthermore, he could not have come from any great distance, or he would have been seen in other localities. He must be some local man, therefore, familiar with the town and neighboring woods, or we very soon could have run him down. He sure is not green in woodcraft. Green be hanged! I don&#39;t believe it.&quot;\n\nCudworth&#39;s frowning gaze rose a little. It rested on a mirror on a wall back of his desk. He felt a sudden chill. A vivid lightning flash illumined the window directly behind him, and he saw a man gazing through the window, his eyes were abnormally bright, and he had a round, repulsive face, drawn and tense, but void of any definite expression and of a peculiar shade of green.\n\nCudworth did not stir. He saw that his discovery was not suspected. He watched the uncanny figure in the feeble light from within when the glare without had vanished. Then the sheriff got up deliberately and removed his coat, as if the room was too warm and he had no intention of going out. Presently, without having glanced toward the window, he sauntered into the adjoining corridor. Then he hastened to the front door, stole quickly around the building, pistol in hand, and crept toward his office window. But his design had been suspected. The green man had fled.\n\nSheriff Cudworth made the most of what he had seen and of the deductions mentioned. He called late the following afternoon on Mrs. Dudley Carroll, a wealthy widow, prominent in local society, and whose home was the most beautiful in Shelby. She was a very attractive woman of middle age and was well acquainted with Cudworth and his family.\n\n&quot;What have I done, sheriff?&quot; she said jestingly, laughing when she received him in her library. &quot;Are you after me for something?&quot;\n\n&quot;I would be, Mrs. Carroll, if I were a single man and about your own age,&quot; Cudworth dryly told her. &quot;No, I&#39;m not after you,&quot; he said more seriously when seated. &quot;I&#39;ve heard that your colored chauffeur, Sam White, has been away for a month or more.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sam?&quot; Mrs. Carroll queried. &quot;Yes, sheriff, he has. You surely don&#39;t want him for any offense. He has grown up in my employ. He&#39;s as honest as the day is long. He&#39;s the best-natured man in the world.&quot;\n\n&quot;I agree with you.&quot; Cudworth told her. &quot;I merely want to learn where he has gone.&quot;\n\nThe sheriff was acquainted with Sam White. He had often seen him going to church on a Sunday with Mrs. Carroll&#39;s youngest servant, a pretty mulatto girl, named Eliza Black. Their names had always seemed to him to be absurdly antithetical, for Sam White was very dark, and Eliza Black almost fair by comparison.\n\n&quot;Well, to tell the truth, sheriff, I don&#39;t know where Sam has gone,&quot; Mrs. Carroll admitted. &quot;He asked permission to go away for a week or two about a month ago,&quot; she explained. &quot;I gave him some money and told him to go ahead and enjoy himself as it was his first holiday.&quot;\n\n&quot;Did he say where he was going?&quot; Cudworth inquired.\n\n&quot;He did not,&quot; Mrs. Cudworth said more gravely. &quot;He was very reticent about it.&quot;\n\n&quot;What did he say?&quot;\n\n&quot;He stated that he had a little scheme in view, strictly private, and that he wanted to investigate it. He did not tell Eliza about it, either.&quot;\n\n&quot;Did he say when he would return?&quot;\n\n&quot;Probably in a week or ten days was the way he put it. He admitted, however, that it might take a little longer.&quot;\n\n&quot;Have you heard from him during his absence?&quot; Cudworth&#39;s calm blue eyes had narrowed slightly.\n\n&quot;Only once,&quot; said Mrs. Carroll. &quot;Eliza received a letter from him three days after he left. The poor girl is dreadfully anxious about him. Perhaps he has been killed by that terrible madman we are hearing so much about. She made herself so ill over it that I called Doctor Wykoff yesterday. He prescribed for her, and said he thinks the madman will soon be caught. In fact, he is spending much of his own time trying to catch him.&quot;\n\n&quot;I heard so this morning,&quot; Cudworth informed her. &quot;Did he say why he was specially anxious to secure the man ?&quot;\n\n&quot;He did not.&quot;\n\n&quot;He may want to diagnose the extraordinary case,&quot; Cudworth allowed, &quot;experiment to learn the cause and cure of so singular a malady. He has a very strong propensity for that sort of thing.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very true; that same propensity has made him quite famous,&quot; Mrs. Carroll reminded him. &quot;You may question Eliza if you wish, sheriff, but I feel sure she can add nothing to what I have told you. I guess Sam will return safely sooner or later.&quot;\n\n&quot;I think so,&quot; Cudworth told her. &quot;Do you know what he wrote to Eliza?&quot;\n\n&quot;Not a word relating to his little scheme, or regarding his whereabouts. He did say, however, that he was with a friend, that he was feeling fine, and that he reckoned as how she wouldn&#39;t know her big stick of licorice when he came back home,&quot; Mrs. Carroll told him, laughing. &quot;That was just the way he put it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Do you know where the letter was mailed?&#39;&#39; Cudworth inquired.\n\n&quot;In North Shelby,&#39;&#39; Mrs. Carroll quickly informed him. &quot;Eliza called my attention to the postmark. So you see, sheriff. Sam has not gone very far away.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, I see.&quot; Cud worth smiled a bit oddly. &quot;No, I won&#39;t question the girl.&quot; he added as he rose to go. &quot;You know, Mrs. Carroll, I&#39;ve always thought pretty well of Sam.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why not ?&quot; she inquired. &quot;He&#39;s an honest, simple, kind-hearted darky. Everybody thinks well of Sam.&quot;\n\nSheriff Cudworth had an idea that very few thought well of Sam about that time.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nTo Save My Soul From Perdition\n\nSheriff Cudworth had rather more than an idea, when he first learned of Sam White&#39;s absence; when he also recalled the hurried arrival of Doctor Wykoff upon the spot where the Venner girls were so badly frightened.\n\nCudworth&#39;s idea had become a theory, and he looked more grimly determined, when he left and started for the home of the physician.\n\nBut Sheriff Cudworth did not call on the physician immediately. It was after six o&#39;clock, and he figured that Doctor Wykoff probably was at dinner with his family, and that he could make the investigations he had in view secretly.\n\nCudworth strode on more rapidly and soon brought up at a low wall in the rear of the physician&#39;s extensive estate. It was about a quarter of a mile from the woodland road where the green man first had been seen. The sheriff deduced a point from the last, and hidden from observation by the intervening orchard, a stable, a garage, and a large cement laboratory, all of which occupied the rear grounds, he began an inspection of the earth on both sides of the wall.\n\nCudworth soon discovered what he was seeking, several footprints corresponding with that of the much wanted man. He found them on both sides of the wall, and he soon observed that all of them pointed away from the estate and toward the distant woods.\n\n&quot;Not one points toward the place,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Plainly, then, he did not come this way and afterward depart. Instead, he only left in this direction and escaped toward the woods. The space between the tracks shows plainly that he was running. Directly in a line from the laboratory, too. Humph! I&#39;ll find out about that.&quot;\n\nHe sprang over the wall and stole through the orchard, where apple and peach trees were in blossom, sweet and beautiful in the softened light of the setting sun. He paused at the rear wall of the laboratory, where he briefly inspected two ground glass windows and peered through a small hole where a piece had been broken from one of the panes. He could see indistinctly that slats appeared to be nailed across the window, and that the room contained a cot on which a wrinkled blanket and pillow were lying.\n\nCudworth&#39;s features had hardened. He stole around to the front door to be sure it was locked and that the building was unoccupied. Then he returned to the rear and quickly broke the other window sufficiently for him to open it and enter.\n\nHe climbed over the sill into a shelved closet, where there were countless bottles, phials and jars, each labeled with a red sticker. It obviously was a closet in which poisons were stored for safe keeping.\n\nCudworth found the door unlocked, however, and he entered the adjoining room, a spacious, finely equipped laboratory. He had no immediate interest in the details of it, but hastened into a small rear room, instead, where he soon confirmed his suspicions. Stout slats were nailed across the window casing. The cot and the room itself were in some disorder. In one corner was a canvas extension case containing a quantity of clothing. The most of it had not been worn since it was laundered.\n\nCudworth crouched in the corner to examine the garments. The sun had set and the light in the room was waning, but after a brief search he found what he was seeking, the man&#39;s initials on one of the linen shirts. He was so intent upon his inspection of the garments that lie had no thought of an intruder until a threatening voice spoke.\n\n&quot;What are you doing? Get up!&quot;\n\nThe sheriff sprang up as if electrified, turned sharply toward the door, and saw Doctor Alexis Wykoff.\n\n&quot;What are you doing?&quot; he repeated. &quot;Put down that gun.&quot; Cudworth eyed him sternly without moving. &quot;It may go off by chance. You may end with killing me.&quot;\n\n&quot;You broke in here like a thief,&quot; Wykoff accused him with increasing severity.\n\n&quot;If I were to kill you, Cudworth, I could justify it in any criminal court.&quot;\n\n&quot;Could you justify it in your own conscience?&quot; Cudworth demanded. &quot;How about that?&quot;\n\n&quot;A man with his liberty menaced, his reputation at stake, with his entire future involved and the happiness of his home and family, does not confer long with his conscience,&quot; Doctor Wykoff retorted. His voice trembled slightly, but he still maintained a threatening attitude.\n\n&quot;Put down the gun,&quot; Cudworth repeated. &quot;You don&#39;t intend to shoot me, Wykoff, or you would have done so at once. Men bent upon murder don&#39;t stop to discuss the crime, or to point out to their victims the occasion for it.&quot;\n\n&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Wykoff again demanded.\n\n&quot;I want to learn what you know about Sam White,&quot; said the sheriff bluntly.\n\n&quot;Why do you suppose I know anything about him?&quot;\n\n&quot;I know you do,&quot; Cudworth said sternly. &quot;He has been confined here. That barred window tells the story. These garments, one bearing his initials, establish his identity. Come to your senses, Wykoff, and come across with the truth,&quot; he advised. &quot;What experimental trick have you pulled off on Sam White, that has caused him to lose his head and turned him as green as a melon? Come across. Shooting me won&#39;t get you anything.&quot;\n\nDoctor Wykoff drew up stiffly and tossed his pistol on the cot. &quot;I did not intend to shoot you, Cudworth, as you inferred,&quot; he said coldly.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s more like it,&quot; said the sheriff.\n\n&quot;I would not kill you, Cudworth, or any other man, to save my soul from perdition,&quot; the physician repeated.\n\n&quot;Now you&#39;re talking, Wykoff,&quot; Cudworth said approvingly. &quot;What the deuce is the meaning of all this? I know you have something to hide, or you would have come forward at once with a frank and open statement. It goes without saying, Doctor Wykoff, that I&#39;ll do anything that I can for you,&quot; Cudworth assured him in a kindly manner characteristic of him. &quot;If it is necessary to suppress — &quot;\n\n&quot;No more of that.&quot; Doctor Wykoff checked him gravely and drew back into the laboratory. &quot;Come this way, Cudworth, and sit down. I&#39;ll tell you all about it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Take your own course.&quot;\n\n&quot;I have repeatedly been impelled to do so. There is so much at stake, however, that I refrained as long as I had any hope of getting hold of Sam White again and setting him right without exposure. There is a point, you know, beyond which a physician is not justified in experimenting on a human subject. I went a step too far.&quot;\n\n&quot;I suspected it,&quot; Cudworth told him as they sat down in the laboratory. &quot;If Sam White — &quot;\n\n&quot;I thought I possibly would find him here,&quot; Doctor Wykoff interrupted. &quot;I hoped that I would, but I was not sure in what condition I would find him, or how violent he still might be. That&#39;s why I entered quietly and discovered you. I had my pistol only to awe and intimidate him. It&#39;s a singular case, Cudworth, and a most deplorable one.&quot;\n\n&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; said the sheriff. &quot;I&#39;ll do all I can to aid you.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re very good.&quot; Doctor Wykoff thanked him with an appreciative nod. &quot;But I must not go into the details at this time. It would take hours for me to state the scientific features of the case. I will tell you the superficial facts, however, and later give you all of the details.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very good,&quot; Cudworth said approvingly. &quot;That may be sufficient.&quot;\n\n&quot;It is by no means a new thing, sheriff, for human beings to make alterations in their personal appearance, changes which they regard as improvements upon nature, or which fashion arbitrarily dictates. It began in the Garden of Eden and has been continued in every country and by every race up to the present day. Beauty is really a matter of taste and custom. Small feet is a requisite in China. The Fiji Islanders dye their hair various bright colors. Stained teeth and nails, painted bodies and — but, Lord Harry, why attempt to enumerate them!&quot; he broke off abruptly. &quot;You know all that as well as I.&quot; &#39;\n\n&quot;Certainly.&quot; Cudworth nodded. &quot;Go on.&quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s common enough right here at home,&quot; Doctor Wykoff continued. &quot;Women paint, pencil their brows and stain their lips. Specialists study the problem of removing wrinkles and the telltale traces of approaching age. One&#39;s complexion is often one&#39;s chief concern. Observe my own. I am very dark and swarthy. That is one reason, perhaps, why I have made a special study of the skin and sought ways and means to modify the pigment causing one&#39;s color and complexion.&quot;\n\n&quot;I follow you,&quot; said Cudworth. &quot;I anticipate what is coming.&quot;\n\n&quot;Quite likely.&quot; Doctor Wykoff smiled faintly. &quot;The color of the skin has always held an important place among physical criteria of the human race. Physiology explains color as a consequence of climate and even diet. This pigment, or coloring matter under the epidermis, or rather under the second skin, is not peculiar to the Negroid or other colored races, but is common to all human beings. It is simply more abundant in certain people.&quot;\n\n&quot;I understand,&quot; said the sheriff. &quot;But I must come to the point,&quot; Doctor Wykoff said, stiffening.\n\n&quot;I have been trying for a long time to find some way to reach and modify this coloring pigment so as to permanently alter one&#39;s complexion. I thought I had succeeded, both by means of an ingredient taken internally, and by the injection of a chemical composition into the skin. I have invented an electrical machine with which the injection may be accomplished, somewhat as tattoo work is done.\n\n&quot;Having faith in it, I was very anxious to get a willing subject for the experiment. I realized that my reputation would be placed in jeopardy, but I felt so sure I was right that I resolved to risk it. It so happened, however, that the subject came to me voluntarily.&quot;\n\n&quot;How did that occur?&quot;\n\n&quot;It appeared that Sam White heard me discussing the possibility of altering one&#39;s color with a friend one day,&quot; Doctor Wykoff explained. &quot;Well, he came to me a little later and wanted to know if I could reduce his color, as he put it,&quot; said the physician. &quot;I asked him why he objected to it. He said he didn&#39;t specially object to it, but that he was in love with a mulatto girl, Eliza Black, who joshed him a good deal about his color, and that he feared she would not marry him because he was so dark.&quot;\n\n&quot;I see.&quot; Cudworth suppressed a smile.\n\n&quot;I told Sam I thought it could be done,&quot; Doctor Wykoff went on gravely. &quot;I also was perfectly frank with him. I told him he would be taking a chance, that it was only an experiment, but he was very anxious for the operation.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sam is very fond of Eliza,&quot; Cudworth remarked.\n\n&quot;Well, to make a long story short, Cudworth, I consented to attempt it,&quot; said the physician. &quot;I bound Sam to absolute secrecy.&quot; He paused, then shrugged his broad shoulders remorsefully. &quot;Well, I performed the operation. Words could not describe my horror when I found, Cudworth, that the process not only had turned him green, but that the ingredients injected into his blood had also affected his brain.\n\n&quot;Sam went violently insane for a time,&quot; Doctor Wykoff continued. &quot;I drugged him heavily to prevent his escape and kept him in the laboratory for two weeks, hoping his abnormal condition would in time be dispelled. It had begun to do so, I think, when he escaped. That was just before he terrified the Venner girls one evening. I was after him when I joined you at that time.&quot;\n\n&quot;I suspected it,&quot; Cudworth informed him.\n\n&quot;Since then I have been trying to get him back here,&quot; Wykoff went on. &quot;I shall be ruined professionally and criminally liable unless he can be found and cured. I feel reasonably sure that he is gradually returning to a normal condition. I base that belief upon the latest descriptions of those who have seen him and say that his color is becoming darker and taking on a mottled appearance. If he could be found and brought here where I could give him proper treatment, I feel sure I could restore him to his normal condition. On the other hand, I will be hopelessly entangled — &quot;\n\n&quot;Stop a bit!&quot; Cudworth leaned forward. &quot;Hush! Not a sound!&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you hear?&quot; Doctor Wykoff whispered.\n\n&quot;Wait. Not a sound. Don&#39;t move.&quot; Sheriff Cudworth arose and tiptoed toward the open front door. His trained ears detected a sound like stealthy footsteps back of the building. The physician waited, with ears strained and eyes aglow, his nerves quivering with suspense under a sudden unexpected hope the sheriff had inspired. Then he heard his voice from some point back of the building, shouting sternly:\n\n&quot;Hold on! I&#39;ll have you this time! Don&#39;t you bolt again, Sam, or I&#39;ll wing you with a chunk of lead. Come here. Come here at once, Sam, or I&#39;ll — &quot;\n\nDoctor Wykoff heard no more. He sprang up with a cry of relief and staggered toward the door just as Sheriff Cudworth, with a grip on the arm and neck of the much wanted man, returned to the laboratory.\n\nIt later appeared that Doctor Wykoff was right, that Sam White had begun to throw off his abnormal condition, that he had just begun to realize his own identity and that something was wrong with him, and he was returning to the physician for aid and advice.\n\nIt seems needless to add that Sam White received a generous amount of both. He came out of the experiment all right, and later married the mulatto girl. The true circumstances were never suspected by the public, much to Doctor Wykoff&#39;s relief.\n\nThe extraordinary feature of the case was that Sam White, when completely restored, was a shade darker than before.\n\n~ The End ~\n"

      "content_html": "A scientific detective, identified with national and international law enforcement agencies, is authority for the statement that there are at least eighteen methods of murder that practically defy detection. Yet the record shows that there are very few murders committed in any one of the eighteen ways that go unpunished. In other words the old adage, &quot;Murder Will Out,&quot; is true according to the record in about ninety percent of all felonious killings.\n\nTo commit a murder in any one of the mentioned eighteen ways it would be necessary for the murderer to be a reasonably advanced scientist. Few possess the technical knowledge necessary to destroy their fellow beings by these methods. Nevertheless, all eighteen of the methods mentioned have been tried from time to time with varying success in escaping conviction.\n\nIt would appear that persons of scientific attainment could be counted upon not to attempt murder. This is not true. Education is not a one-hundred percent deterrent to crime. Educated persons have only a slightly less average as potential murderers than the illiterate. Not even motives differ except in cases of murder for robbery. Considering robbery as greed this difference is removed. Jealousy figures as a motive in a large number of murders and among the educated murderers it is paramount.\n\nConsidering murder — for that matter all forms of crime — as an art it would seem likely that the criminals of education or scientific attainment would excel as master craftsmen. This isn&#39;t true either. Just the opposite prevails. In practically all crimes attempted by scientists they bungle their jobs completely. The record proves positively that as criminals scientists are flunkies without a single recorded exception.\n\nWhere a murder is committed by a method that destroys its own evidence or fails to leave what might be called a &quot;trace&quot; or clue detectives are hampered but not necessarily baffled. In these cases, almost without exception, it is circumstances that bring the criminal to punishment. While a jury might refuse to convict on circumstantial evidence a detective is not so deterred. The scientific detective turns science against the scientific murderer. He batters the suspect with circumstantial evidence until in nine out of ten cases the scientific suspect weakens and acknowledges his crime. Circumstantial evidence backed by a confession that checks on all angles is about all any jury needs to be convinced of guilt.\n\nWhen your correspondent began to dig into this subject of artistic or scientific murder Government detectives — themselves master scientists — made a request. They asked that we be &#39;&#39;a little vague&quot; in the use of proper names and in description of the eighteen murder methods most difficult of detection. So, we will name no chemicals or poisons but confine ourselves to effects and processes.\n\nThe commonest method is the complete destruction of the corpse — the corpus delicti. Cremation is the usual means resorted to. The body is burned in a furnace or on a pyre. Effort is sometimes made to make identification impossible by burning the body or parts of it in gasoline flames. The scientist has no edge on his uneducated fellow in this type of murder case. He practically never is able to remain with the burning corpse long enough to do a perfect job.\n\nIn many cases complete dissolution of the corpse is attempted by immersion in acids. There are acids that completely dissolve bone tissue and even clothing but circumstances usually reveal these crimes. Accessibility to such chemicals and procurement of such chemicals usually lead to a search. The search usually leads to the finding of bone fragments, identifiable by means of buttons, bits of jewelry, metallic dentistry and other bits of evidence which escapes or lather resists the acid effects.\n\nAnd now we get into some deep scientific water. It is actually possible by the exact and accurate dosage of a certain poison, over a long period, to produce death &quot;by typhoid fever.&quot; This poison, a common and easily available one shows up like an electric sign when not scientifically administered. But when given in frequent and exact small quantities it produces every symptom of typhoid. Quite often the corpse is buried as a typhoid victim.\n\nIn most of these &quot;typhoid&quot; cases the motive is insurance and the murderer encouraged by success in one case attempts others. Sometimes there are a score of victims. In practically all cases the murderer is convicted in the long run. The circumstances that usually bring about detection are doctors and nurses and neighbors. They will remember that the murderer was always quite enthusiastic about insurance. A nurse will remember that the murderer insisted on preparing the victim&#39;s food. Sometimes a druggist will remember selling some poison to kill a dog or as an insecticide.\n\nChapter 2\n\nThere is, too, a gas that administered in exactly correct quantities will produce &#39;&#39;tuberculosis.&quot; This gas kills instantly unless scientifically administered. A small quantity will cause the lungs to &quot;rot&quot; gradually bringing death in from five to thirty days with all the symptoms of rapid or &quot;galloping&quot; consumption. Doctors have so diagnosed such cases but circumstances usually bring the crime to light. First among these is that the gas is rare, &quot;ordinarily. It can be home-made but only by a chemist with a well-grounded knowledge.\n\nIt would appear that, among poisons, the most powerful would be the hardest to detect. This because a small dose would leave less trace than a large one. It follows only in some cases. One very powerful poison absolutely defies detection. Another, and the most deadly poison known to man reveals itself instantly. This second poison perfumes the corpse and leaves it smelling with a fruity odor. Any doctor or chemist can identify it instantly regardless of how small the dose might have been.\n\nIn the event of the first named powerful poison — the one that defies detection —  there is no odor or other discernible indication of any nature. When scientifically administered the fatal dose is less than one billionth the weight of an ordinary human body. Thus, to trace it, the autopsy doctors would have to find, separate or segregate x billionth bit of the mass under observation. The body completely absorbs the fatal chemical and so — .\n\nThis poison has its uses but is rare and impossible to obtain even by most chemists. There are few dispensing druggists who have scales sensitive enough to weigh the dosage of the chemical. Even for doctors to obtain it is an undertaking involving considerable red tape. But it has been used by murderers — scientific murderers. Circumstances in these cases have proven that the murderer possessed the drug and had a motive to use it. Confession has followed circumstantial evidence in some cases and in others conviction has been obtained on expert testimony backed by positive circumstantial conditions, such as the presence of the corpse and proof of the ante-mortem possession of the fatal drug by the suspected murderer.\n\nA fiction story of the football grid, some years ago, involved the use of a solution to produce a fatal gas under conditions of bodily heat produced by violent exercise. This was authentic so far as action and effects were concerned. In the football story the victim&#39;s sweater was soaked in a deadly solution. Under the heat of the exercise during the football game the victim&#39;s body generated the gas which he inhaled. The gas stimulated his heart action to the point where a blood vessel was ruptured causing death.\n\nThe actual case from which this fiction story was borrowed involved a man, a wife, and the wife&#39;s clandestine violinist lover. The wife knitted the sweater for her admirer. Her husband dipped it in chemical solution and dried it while his wife was absent. When she returned she expressed the sweater to her admirer. He wore it under his shirt. His body heat produced the gas which was inhaled by the violinist in sufficient quantities to cause death.\n\nThe hypodermic needle is a weapon of death which has caused autopsy physicians trouble since its invention. Murder by the hypodermic needle, no doubt, would escape detection often enough were it not for circumstances. Such circumstances of death are ever in the mind of autopsy doctors. Where evidence warrants it corpses are subjected to microscopic and meticulous search to locate a hypodermic puncture. And they can be located even when hidden back of an eyelid as was the in one instance that of an infant. The suspected murderer, in this case, a colored mother, died in an insane asylum.\n\nIn cases such as have been described here readers might wonder why names, dates and places are not revealed. They might ask why scientific detectives desire the text to be vague. The reason is quite simple and understandable once it is explained. Even where conviction is obtained in such cases it is only after the most laborious and expensive processes and investigations. Living relatives of the accused in each case might be moved to bring suit on any of many grounds. This would result in more long, laborious and expensive litigation — to the Government, the writer, the publisher, doctors, detectives and what not?\n\nThis thing has been going on for centuries. As far back as history records mysterious poisons have been a common means of murder. There are thousands of poisons. Some of these, products of the jungles held secret by savage tribes, are still little known to or understood by scientists. Poisons are given up by the earth, secreted by plants and, by animals. They are produced by combining chemicals and by chemical reactions. In nature they are begotten by elemental distillation, by the action of the sun&#39;s rays, by the excrement of animals including the fishes, by the promulgation of minute organisms, and in a myriad of mysterious ways.\n\nSome of these processes are well understood and some little understood by man. As is the case with electrical and other forms of scientific research the field of scientific criminal detection hardly has been scratched. Research is constant and no doubt will be perpetual. No one knows where any sort of research will lead. Scientific detectives call attention to this fact:\n\n&quot;Such research is valuable not only in the matter of law enforcement but might prove of inestimable value in other fields. It might lead to a discovery that would end cancer or one that would end war.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n"

Over to the left were the red-tiled office buildings blistering and peeling under the torrid August sun. Lazy-looking employees wandered indifferently across the shaggy lawns. In fact, King-Tanger Studios seemed to have gone to the dogs in the three years I was away. Why, when Uncle King was alive—\n\n“Well, Mister Kelley!” Connor snapped at me sarcastically. “Anytime you’re ready!”\n\n“Okay,” I grinned. “Shoot.”\n\nHis sharp eyes, owlish under heavy glasses, pinned me down. “I hope you know what’s going on!”\n\n“Sure,” I said blithely. “Good old B-7 Western! Just as Kirk Tanger steps out, I jump in and take his place for the scrap. Then I leap on my—rather his— faithful nag and ride away down the set with bullets nipping at my ears.”\n\nIt was an outdoor set, the old saloon front, and dusty cowtown street that I remembered so vividly from the old days. Like everything I’d seen on the lot in the three days I had been back from overseas, it looked on its last legs.\n\nKirk Tanger, who had been co-owner with my Uncle King of K-T—and who now owned it all—was the star. He didn’t seem to like my coming back at all, though he hid his dislike under that famous back-slapping personality.\n\nBut under Kitty Riley’s persuasion, he offered me a job doubling for him in the horse opera. He knew I could handle my dukes with the best of them, and that years on my uncle’s ranch had made the feel of a pony under me the most natural thing in the world.\n\nI decided to take him up on it, mostly so I’d be near Kitty. I didn’t like the way they acted in the clinches. Kirk Tanger was ten years older than I. But we did have about the same build. He’s six foot one, rangy and slim, with wide shoulders and narrow hips. He’s got curly brown hair and a self-important swagger.\n\nThe director grunted. I watched Tanger ham it up with his favorite heavy, Lank Rennagan.\n\n“You’ve run this cowtown long enough, Jake Carson!” Tanger cried.\n\nRennagan, big, dirty-faced, ugly, mugged and taunted him while the cameras rolled. “Why, you lily-livered pup. I’ll—”\n\nTanger, ye hero, started circling him. I waited for my cue. It came when Tanger backed up and enveloped the camera eye for a split-second. I darted in swiftly and made with the fists.\n\nFast and furious action followed. I popped about his ears while his haymakers whizzed around mine. I was careful to pull my punches. The sound effects would help the illusion along, plus additional speeding up, and spliced-in close- ups of Tanger’s pretty puss, so the movie-goers would think it was him all the time.\n\nWe played it up hot and heavy, like the freckle-faced kids in the front row like it, then I flattened the “bad guy,” leaped on Tanger’s pinto, and raised dust down the fake cowtown street.\n\nThe cameras ground on. This was a cheap quickie. Tanger wasn’t wasting any film. Guns roared behind me. I thought I felt something zing past my ear. The thought made me grin. As if anybody would be using real bullets? But when I ambled back for a retake, Kitty, who was the femme lead, stared at me with wide hazel eyes.\n\n“Jack!” she cried. “You’re bleeding!”\n\nMy ear did sting, so I put my hand up to it. It came back red. “Must of nicked it in the scrap,” I smiled casually. After three years as tail gunner a little scratch like that doesn’t seem anything to get excited about.\n\nTanger walked up just then. He looked pale under his bottled suntan. I noticed a blood vessel in his temple hopping.\n\n“Come on over to the dispensary, pal,” he said. “I’ll touch it up for you.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Live Bullet\n\nI followed him into the little studio dispensary, wondering what was up. Why was Tanger calling me pal, all of a sudden, when everybody on the lot knew Kitty had tossed him over for me?\n\nWe looked a little like brothers, dressed alike in the same flashy Western breeches and boots. Mine were a little roughed up after a hard day’s shooting, and my face didn’t need fake tan. It was browned permanently by South Pacific trade winds. The lines around my eyes and mouth didn’t get there from cutting up around Hollywood spots.\n\n“Listen, Kelley,” Tanger said, booting the door shut behind us, “you didn’t nick yourself fighting. A live bullet did that!”\n\nI examined it critically in the mirror. Could be. “What makes you think so?” I asked.\n\n“I saw the puff of smoke from the harness shop window. I ran around fast as I could, behind. I got just a glimpse of the man who shot you.”\n\n“What’d he look like?”\n\n“Couldn’t see his face because he wore a black mask.”\n\n“Mask?”\n\n“Yeah. Don’t you get it, Kelley? Both you and I—and Rennagan too, when he’s pulling a trick—wear a ‘masked rider’ get-up in the picture. Another masked rider floating around the lot wouldn’t excite any comment!”\n\nI winced as he painted up my scratch and taped it. “Smart guy,” I whistled. “Now, who do you suppose wants me out of the way?”\n\nTanger shook his head.\n\n“Not you. Me!”\n\n“You?” I asked innocently. Offhand I could think of half a dozen reasons, all of them blonde.\n\nTanger’s pretty face writhed, “I can’t tell you what it’s all about, Kelley, but believe me. I know. The man who’s out to get me doesn’t know I use a double. He doesn’t know you. Now, here’s what I want you to do …”\n\nI saw it coming. I knew all along Tanger had something up his sleeve when he brought me in here. I shrugged noncommittally.\n\n“You’ve got to do it, pal!” he insisted desperately. “It’s important to the whole studio. Without me this picture will never be finished. If it isn’t, no more K-T. He’s out to get me. He’s a cold-blooded killer. Will stop at nothing! You’ve just got to help me, pal!”\n\nI sighed, facing him. “Just what do you want me to do about it?”\n\nHe slapped my shoulder, his face glowing with relief. “I knew you’d do it, pal!”\n\nI winced. This pal stuff didn’t set well with me. It was a lot different from the way Tanger acted when I first got back. Oh, well. That was because of Kitty. Tanger had been trying to convince her she ought to marry him ever since I left. From the way she, herself, had been acting, I wasn’t sure he hadn’t succeeded.\n\n“Easy on the orchids,” I murmured. “I haven’t said I’d do anything yet.” The sore look that flashed in his eyes vanished quick-like. He put on a bland ingratiating tone.\n\n“Nothing to it, Kelley. All I want is for you to pretend to be me for the next few days, until the picture’s wrapped up. Live at my place in Beverly Hills. Go to the premiere tonight. Use my car and chauffeur. Why, it’s a breeze!”\n\n“I didn’t much care for the breeze that bullet made fanning my ear,” I reminded him.\n\n“There’s five grand in it,” he said. Funny how the mention of a nice round sum like five thousand dollars can change a guy’s mind. Kitty and I could get married. I could buy in with Old Karpis at his movie horse-trainer ranch out in the Valley, as I’d always wanted. As Tanger said, three years of it had made me rather immune to the smell of danger.\n\nI said, “Yes.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Top Kick of K-T\n\nThe night was typical Hollywood. The heat of the day had cooled down considerably. The sky had shaded down to a deep, rich cobalt.\n\nI sat back luxuriously in Tanger’s smooth limousine, wearing his best tux and smoking one of his best cigars, while Jim, his chauffer, sent the hade spinning down the Sunset Strip out of Beverly Hills, then veering onto Hollywood Boulevard toward the nest of fanning arc-fights that stabbed their wag prettily toward the stars.\n\nHollywood was doing itself proud at this big-time premiere. As top-kick of K-T, it was Tanger’s duty to put to in an appearance. Tonight, with my face deftly made up, I was Tanger. He himself would come, slip in with the general public.\n\nJim braked the car smoothly in front of the mobbed entrance canopy, which was flanked on either side by bleacher seats that had been rigged up for the occasion. With hundreds of movie fans’ eyes drilling me as they babbled their criticisms, I stepped down the brightly lit carpeting.\n\nThen I saw Kitty. She was breathtaking in a knockout of a blue evening dress with silver sequins. I forgot I was putting on an act and hurried up to her.\n\n“Hello.”\n\n“Why, Kirk!” I took her arm, then noticed her staring at the neat square of tape on my ear.\n\n“Why, you’re not—”\n\nI shushed her quickly, and we went in. During the show I spent my time trying to dope out this deal. I hadn’t had a good chance to talk to Kitty since I got back, with Tanger monopolizing her, and had hoped to later. Somehow, in the mob, I lost track of her. Then a couple reporters buttonholed me. I had to lam out before one of them found out I wasn’t really Tanger.\n\nI went back to the car. It was parked around the corner on a shady little side- street, as I had instructed. That’s one thing about Hollywood. Two blocks off the main drag and you might be m some quiet little hamlet.\n\n“Okay, Jim,” I said, hopping in. “Let’s go.”\n\nThe chauffeur’s cap ahead of me nodded, and we were off, suddenly. I happened to glance m the mirror over the chauffeur’s head. “Hey, you’re not Jim I” I yelled, “Who—”\n\nHe flashed a pistol, managing to keep his eyes on the road and on me in the little mirror as we swerved around a corner on two wheels and started east op into the Hollywoodland hills.\n\n“Sit still, Tanger!” he snapped roughly. “This is where you get took!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nEnd of the Line\n\nI didn’t bother to disabuse him of the idea that I was Tanger. I was worried about his driving. It was as if he had suddenly gone nuts. He took those hairpin turns on two wheels. All I could see were his eyes and a rough pen of makeup. He was a bad actor, all right.\n\nI lit a cigarette and sat back. The long car hurtled upward through the brilliant night, then suddenly braked at the brink of a five-hundred-foot drop. It was a lonely scrubby stretch, with the city spread out below like a jeweled pattern. He leaped out, flung open my door, shoving his gun to my face. “All right, chiseler,” he snapped. “This is the end of the line.” He might he a ham-actor, as I decided, but he wasn’t acting now. This was the real McCoy.\n\nI grinned back at him impishly. “Take it slow,” I soothed. Then I jumped.\n\nThe impact of my sudden lunge sent him reeling back a step, with a grunt of surprise. His gun flung lead between my crooked elbow and my midriff. I could feel death tickle my ribs with the end of his scythe. I put everything I got into a swift uppercut. His head snapped back. My other fist cracked down on his gun-hand, sent the roscoe flying off into all those spangled lights, into oblivion.\n\nWith a snarl he was out of his spin and on me. His fingers reached for my throat. Then we were waltzing dreamily on the graveled edge of that cliff. I had his wrists and was trying to pin them back. He shook loose and started slugging and gouging. He was no mean shakes. He knew a thing or two, must have learned it from the Japs, it was that dirty.\n\nHe faked, as if I’d hit him too low. I fell for it. In the second I relaxed his fist came up. Everything swam around me. Or maybe it was me who was swimming, going around and round on the black wall of the hell-deep whirlpool. Above me hung an ugly paint-smeared puss.\n\nI grabbed out at him feebly, yanked. He moved back, but I caught his shirt. Buttons scattered. Then I went down into that whirlpool, with a faint faraway sound like a siren screaming—or maybe a girl.\n\nBut there was one shred left of my shattered consciousness. One chunk of knowledge that stayed with me through the aeons of bad dreams that followed. It was the sight of the slugger’s swirling black chest—and of a triangular red mole on his throat, on the lower part of his left breastbone.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nA Raw Deal\n\nThe feel of soft hands on my forehead helped me out of it. It was nice. Pain shot through me in seven directions, but those cool hands helped a lot. When I opened my peepers, relief rolled over me in a tidal wave. I wasn’t in some nasty old Jap prison camp; I was in Kitty Riley’s apartment. She was looking down at me with sorry, anxious eyes.\n\n“What gives?” I wondered, with a low groan.\n\n“Easy, soldier,” she soothed me, in that low husky voice of hers. “You’ve had quite a time for yourself.”\n\nI remembered everything. I sat up quickly. “What happened?” I demanded, feasting my eyes on her soft taffy ringlets and wide kissable lips.\n\n“We were at the premiere, remember?”\n\n“Sure. I lost you in the mob. Go on.”\n\n“Well, I bumped into Kirk. He yanked me out of a side door with him.” Her voice was like dripping honey. “I had my coupe. Kirk offered to drive me home, and on the way I noticed your car. The driver seemed to be hopped up, so I insisted that we follow you. Of course my jalopy can’t keep up to Kirk’s limousine, which you were in, so we lagged behind, making those hills the best we could. We reached you just as you went into your tailspin.”\n\n“What about the pug?”\n\n“Got away. Jumped in the car and beat it. As I said,” she smiled, “my little coupe is no match for that big bus.”\n\n“What happened to Jim?”\n\n“Kirk called me a few minutes ago to see if you had come out of it yet. It seems Jim got a message, ostensibly from his boss, telling him to leave the car and hurry home.”\n\nI nodded, scowling. “So Jim went, and my would-be killer took his place. Did you notify the cops?”\n\nKitty shook her shiny curls. “Kirk said no. He looked you over. Said you would be okay, and wanted it hushed up. It all has to do with whoever he’s afraid of.\n\n“Got any ideas about that?” I asked casually, lighting a cigarette.\n\n“No-o.” She looked thoughtful. “Wait. Yes, I have. You know Mocardai?”\n\n“The gambling house king? I’ve heard of him. He’s a nice character to cross.”\n\n“Kirk owes him money. A lot of money.”\n\nI tried my legs and found I could stand up, if a little shakily. “Jack,” Kitty said, in a low different voice, “why don’t you go away?”\n\n“What for?”\n\n“I—I don’t know what this is all about, exactly, but why stick your neck out?” I eyed her carefully. She looked sincere enough, but then, Kitty’s quite an actress. On a hunch I asked, “What’s about the studio?”\n\n“In a pretty bad way, Jack,” she wagged her blonde head. “Seems as if nobody will take a chance on Kirk Tanger, since your Uncle King died. It’s all rather odd.” She put her soft hand on my arm.\n\n“Jack, I’ve always thought you got a raw deal. King meant to leave his half of K-T to you.”\n\nI smiled crookedly. “That was before I enlisted. King’s doctor could have kept me out, he thought. I couldn’t see it that way at all. You know King. As long as you did things his way everything was fine. The minute you crossed him he dropped you like a hot grenade. Tanger stayed. I didn’t. That’s the whole story in a nutshell.”\n\nKitty looked so genuinely sorry about it that I planted a kiss square on her wide lips. It tasted wonderful, but I still wasn’t sure. “Good-bye,” I told her and scrammed.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nLast Will and Testament\n\nFour hours I slept, then went out to the studio. It was a good half hour before shooting time. Contrary to propaganda, a star’s day starts real early and lasts real late sometimes. With a quickie Western like this one, it was even tougher. Tanger was shooting it on a shoestring, and a frayed one at that.\n\nI found out from the gateman that Tanger’s office was vacant, so I slipped in the back way. I used one of my uncle’s keys which I had found among his personal effects. I left the blinds down while I went over the joint. Since Tanger wasn’t going to let me in on his little secret I was going to probe it out for myself. If I was going to continue dodging bullets, I was going to know why. Furthermore, as Kitty hinted, there was something mighty funny going on at K-T.\n\nI saw that one of the desks had been taken out. A single big mahogany affair filled the center of Tanger’s private office. I tried the drawers first. Nothing unusual. Then I turned my attention to the metal wall cabinets. At first I found nothing there, either, until I found a green strongbox tucked way down in at the bottom. It was heavy so I set it down on the floor. The lock was a good one, but I remembered King’s key ring and tried them, one by one.\n\nOn my knees by it, I flung the cover back and combed through its contents. I whistled when I found it. The envelope was marked, Last Will and Testament. Herbert J. King.\n\nMy uncle. It was dated July 8th, just three days before he died. I broke the seal and started reading it.\n\n“I, Herbert J. King, being of sound mind and—”\n\nI heard the back door snap shut softly behind me. I whirled in time to catch just a glimpse of a black shadow wearing a mask. Before I could get to my feet he lunged, pounced on me like a panther. My head hit a corner of the cabinet. For a few seconds all I saw were stars. When I came out of it he had vanished out of the back door, the envelope and will along with him.\n\nI sprang after him, muttering a few choice words I had picked up in New Guinea. I flung open the door in time to see Kirk Tanger striding bare-headed toward the office, dressed in cowboy togs, his spurs jingling.\n\nHe looked surprised to see me coming out of the back door of his private office, but only smiled amiably. “Waiting to see me, Kelley?” he asked.\n\n“Yeah.” I watched him narrowly. “I want some information.”\n\nHe smiled that famous smile. “I get it, Kelley. Since tangling with a gunman last night, you figure it’s time I let you in on what it’s all about. Eh, pal?”\n\nI just nodded.\n\n“Well, pal, I was on my way to find you. It’s like this. I ran up a sizable gambling debt with Mocardai, and he doesn’t like waiting.”\n\n“And he decided to take it out of your hide?”\n\n“That’s it,” Tanger nodded. “Last night I got him to call off his hounds. I convinced him that I can settle up as soon as this picture is finished, which will be in a few days. He’s willing to wait.”\n\nAll nice and smooth, but it didn’t set well in my craw. It matched what Kitty had told me last night, but that just put her in the shade alongside Tanger. Well, maybe you couldn’t blame a girl for changing her mind about a guy, once she found out he was not going to inherit half a movie studio. Just suppose, for instance, that Kitty hadn’t just “happened” to follow me last night. Suppose Tanger wasn’t with her at all. Suppose that he—\n\nThat did it. The rising tide of anger inside me swept up into my brain. I made a quick grab at Tanger’s silk collar,\n\n“What goes on?” he grinned, good-naturedly.\n\n“Nothing,” I mumbled. “Nothing at all.”\n\nI walked away fast, stiff-legged. I was wrong. Dead wrong. There was no triangular red mole on Tanger’s chest. No mole of any kind.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nA Triangular Red Mole\n\nToday’s takes were to be some of the last big scenes. All the location shots were completed, processed and ready for cutting in the lab, having been filmed the week before up in the Sherwood Lake country.\n\nThere was the usual barroom free-for- all, with the usual collapsing chairs and bottles busted over heads. It played havoc with the flimsy set, making it unlikely that it would stand up under another such brawl or even a retake.\n\nThen Connor, the director, barked out orders for the final to-the-death battle between Lank Rennagan, the heavy lead, and the hero. In the eyes of the public, Kirk Tanger. Actually me. Tanger wouldn’t dream of risking that pretty face of his before the cameras, any more than he would risk it in real life. Or would he, I wondered, if the stakes were high enough. A couple of telephone calls had told me a lot that I hadn’t known before, and was never intended to know.\n\nConnor’s heavy voice bawled instructions. Mopping his bald dome that glinted under the heavy lights, he finished, “Adlib it. But make it good! We don’t want to have any retakes! Can’t afford it! Make it real!”\n\nRennagan grinned at me wolfishly. There was an odd gleam in his eyes, but it didn’t really register until a little later.\n\nThe cameras rolled. Rennagan came at me, mugging ferociously. I slipped under his lunge and landed a make-believe punch on his jaw. His head went back and he sprawled on the floor. Then he was up again and at me. We clinched.\n\nSome of his slugs landed hard, but it can’t be entirely faked. I thought nothing of it until his hairy arm grabbed me suddenly and yanked me down behind the bar.\n\nIt happened fast. His left hand seized my throat and forced me flat against the floor. Then he grabbed a half-smashed bottle, a real one.\n\nI got a glimpse of his hairy chest. There was a red mole on it. A triangular red mole. So now I knew! Rennagan was the one I had tangled with last night. He was going to finish the job now!\n\nStudio accidents do happen. He’d purposely got me behind the bar, out of camera range, so he could make it look like that. “This time you’ll stay out!” he whispered. I saw the ragged edge of glass swing down at me.\n\nSweating blood, I yanked to one side in time, swung a roundhouse into his solar plexus. He gave a howl of anguish and let the bottle drop. My boot went out into his belt, and sent him flying into the open.\n\nI leaped after him. Fury was upon me. I forgot all about cameras and movies. All I knew was that Rennagan had tried to kill me, at least twice. I plastered my fists all over his greasy pan. I hit him over and over again, until I was out of wind. Then, as he sagged, I cracked out once more, with all my weight behind it. He dropped without a sound.\n\n“Bravo!” Connor applauded behind me as the cameras stopped. ‘‘Best scrap I’ve directed in fifteen years!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nYellow-Bellied 4F\n\nI swayed there a moment, getting back my wind. Ignoring Connor’s orchids, I walked up to Kirk Tanger, who was standing off to one side with Kitty.\n\n“He meant to kill you!” Kitty cried tremulously. “I saw it in his eyes!”\n\n“Yeah,” I said, stroking my cut knuckles. My eyes were on Tanger. He was pale. The smile on his pan looked lopsided.\n\n“Nonsense!” he said, trying to laugh it off. “Why Rennagan’s the best heavy on the lot!”\n\n“That why you picked him to get rid of me last night?” I demanded.\n\n“W-What—”\n\n“Don’t you think it’s about time you quit play-acting? You’re not that good!”\n\nHe drew himself up. “I don’t know what you mean, Kelley.” He started to stalk away, insulted. I stuck out my arm and twirled him around so I could look him square in the face.\n\n“You milked your way into Uncle King’s favors ever since he picked you up on the street and brought you to K-T. When you became a star, you bought in. When I enlisted, and you yellow-bellied your way into a 4-F classification, you put on the pressure. You all but kissed his boots.\n\n“You knew he had a bad heart. So when he told you about the new will he made, in my favor, you decided both he and I had to die. In his case it was easy. A drop of something in his heart medicine would do the trick.\n\n“You hid the new will. You didn’t dare destroy it, because there was a witness, King’s valet. So you paid him off and got him to leave town. When I got back, you faked up this gag about somebody who was after you, and offered me five grand to take your place in order to make my death look completely accidental. You hired Rennagan to do your dirty work. But he bungled the job last night, so you told him to finish it today.\n\n“You knew I found that will in your office, because you were the masked character who stepped in on me. You knocked me down and ran out, tucked the will under your shirt and pulled off your mask, then came back, pretending you had just got there!”\n\nTanger’s lips twitched. “You can’t prove any of this!” he retorted.\n\n“No? I checked the time you really came in the lot gate with the gateman. It matched. I found out from King’s valet’s mother where he had gone. I called him long distance. When I told him what I suspected, he came clean, told me all he knew about the new will, dispossessing you and making me controlling owner of K-T. Now, hand it over!”\n\n“I—I haven’t got it!” Tanger cried. “I burned it! I mean—”\n\n“Oh, no, you didn’t!” Kitty told him, her eyes blazing with disgust. “I met Jack just after he left you. He told me to keep my eyes on you every second!”\n\nGrinning, I grabbed his pretty silk shirt and ripped it open. There was the will, tucked partway under his wide belt. I tossed it to Kitty, then grabbed Tanger by the belt and studied his pretty pan speculatively, as if wondering where I was going to begin.\n\nHe cowered back. “No! No!” he whimpered, having seen what his pal Rennagan got.\n\n“Don’t hit him!” Kitty cried. “Please don’t!”\n\n“Why not?” I demanded, scowling.\n\n“Remember, dear,” she said sweetly, “This picture isn’t quite finished yet, and he is the star. We’ll need his slimy puss for some closeups, as is. As wife-to-be of the controlling owner of K-T I say we’ve got to be prudent! Mangle him later, dear!”\n\nI pushed Tanger away and drew Kitty close to me, grinning.\n\n“Anyhow,” I said. “Here’s one fade-out clinch where the double takes over!” I signaled to Connor. “Let ’em roll, professor!”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Darning His Socks\n  A Tramp in Trouble\n  A Symbol of Revenge\n  &quot;Air Raid&quot; Danger\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nDarning His Socks\n\nWhen the two men passed him in Clayhanger Lane, heading towards Hanford on the Great West Road, Mr. Wilcox was sitting in the ditch darning his socks.\n\nThe tall, laughing one threw Mr. Wilcox sixpence, and the short one was fired to imitate this act of generosity. He tossed over some coppers.\n\nMr. Wilcox&#39;s weather-beaten face crinkled into a smile of pleasure.\n\n&quot;Thank &#39;ee, gentlemen,&quot; he said. &quot;Best o&#39; luck to &#39;ee, sirs.&quot;\n\nHe raised a soiled forefinger to his brimless, bandless old straw hat.\n\n&quot;Same to you, old man,&quot; returned the tall one.\n\n&quot;As I was saying, Henderson,&quot; he went on, resuming his evidently high-spirited conversation, &quot;that life you and I were leading was small-town stuff. But it&#39;s different now. You were my boss, and I was the underling. We&#39;ve both suffered since then. Both been through the hoop. And now that we&#39;re Londoners, we both see things from a different angle.&quot;\n\n&quot;Your right there, Jones,&quot; agreed the other with a sigh. &quot;Time and the big city are the great levellers.&quot;\n\nThe tall one laughed at this, and, watching them as they turned the hedge-flanked bend in the lane, which was situated between allotments, Mr. Wilcox&#39;s eyes registered contempt.\n\n&quot;Great levellers!&quot; he grinned to himself. &quot;If ye don&#39;t git above yerself, like a stuck-up blarsted chump, ye don&#39;t &#39;ave to be levelled down.&quot;\n\nThe other two had evidently paused by a stile round the bend to study the landscape.\n\nWhilst hanging an old driving-mirror on the hedge, and producing his shaving tackle, Mr. Wilcox was able to hear their conversation.\n\n&quot;As a matter of fact, Henderson,&quot; said Jones, &quot;I&#39;m doing a little levelling myself. There&#39;s an old house up on Hanford Heath which is to be experimentally bombed from the air next Thursday. And as leader of the A.R.P. rescue squad it will be my job to organise the fire fighting and the rescue of dummies. It will be a good show. Small explosive and incendiary bombs will be dropped from R.A.F. planes.&quot;\n\nAs Mr. Wilcox lathered his face with soap and ditch water, a further piece of good luck came his way  boisterous group of young men and girls came along.\n\n&quot;What a picture for the papers,&quot; said one of the young men. He produced a camera from a leather case which was slung over his shoulder, and offered Mr. Wilcox a shilling to pose in the act of shaving.\n\nThe tramp demanded five shillings, and a bargain was struck at half-a-crown.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Tramp in Trouble\n\nThe party proceeded along the lane towards Hanford, and, as he packed up his kit preparatory to following them, Mr. Wilcox heard them shouting excitedly. It sounded like trouble. One of them was telling someone else to run for the police.\n\nMr. Wilcox hesitated in his stride.\n\nHe did not want to be near any kind of bother which involved police intervention, for he generally got the blame for it, whatever it was.\n\nMr. Wilcox turned and went the other way.\n\nThis was a terrible mistake, for it only needed a furtive move of this kind to condemn him, in the public mind, as the undoubted perpetrator of the murder with which he was subsequently charged.\n\nHenderson — the short one — had been killed in such a peculiarly horrible way that people assured one another that only a creature of the lowest type —  meaning Mr. Wilcox — could conceivably have done the deed.\n\nMr. Wilcox had to answer a lot of crazy questions. He was visited in his cell by a mental specialist, a lawyer, and a gentleman who seemed a little more human than the others, despite a somewhat morbid interest in freak crime.\n\nThe gentleman s name was Dixon Hawke, and he came accompanied by a youth, whom he addressed as Tommy.\n\n&quot;A doctor friend of mine has been telling me about you, Wilcox,&quot; he said, &quot;and when that photograph of you was published, I became very interested in the case. I may be able to help you.&quot;\n\n&quot;And pigs might fly,&quot; moaned the prisoner, &quot;but not them pigs in blue uniforms! They won&#39;t never &#39;ave wings.&quot;\n\nHawke smiled, and studied the face of the tramp intently for a moment.\n\n&quot;You seem a very intelligent chap,&quot; he remarked after a pause. &quot;The doctor — a mental specialist — examined you because it was thought that you were mad. He considers you perfectly sane.&quot;\n\n&quot;Very decent of &#39;im, I&#39;m sure.&quot;\n\n&quot;It seems incredible that a sane man would stop within a hundred yards of where he&#39;d committed a murder and draw attention to himself by shaving in public.&quot;\n\n&quot;Would be a bit peculiar, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes. But not more so than the crime itself. That is the most peculiar affair that I have ever come across. This man Henderson was found lying on his back with a cabbage on his chest. The cabbage had been pulled from an adjoining allotment, and it was pinned to him by a pointed wooden stake, taken from a hurdle fence. The stake had been rammed with terrific force so that it went through the heart of the cabbage and through that of the man as well.&quot;\n\nThe prisoner shuddered.\n\n&quot;I wouldn&#39;t do no such thing as that,&quot; he declared. &quot;&#39;Sides, what should I want to do it for?&quot;\n\n&quot;He hadn&#39;t been robbed,&quot; agreed Hawke. &quot;The prosecution might argue that you were disturbed before you had a chance to take his wallet, but I&#39;m hanged if I can see how they are going to account for the fantastic nature of the murder, unless you are proved insane.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why don&#39;t you try an&#39; find the man who really did it? What about &#39;is pal, Jones?&quot;\n\n&quot;Alfred Jones,&quot; said Hawke, &quot;who is manager of a new grocery store in Hanford, had just met Henderson, who was formerly his boss in a Midland town. They separated at the fork in the lane, Henderson being bound for a point a couple of miles higher up the road from Hanford. His body was found a few yards away from the fork.\n\n&quot;Jones appears to have been in the highest spirits about the meeting,&quot; went on the detective. &quot;As soon as he reached Hanford he told three friends about it, for it was the first time since his arrival in London that he had met anyone connected with a past chapter of his life, and he expressed himself as looking forward keenly to another meeting with his old acquaintance.&quot;\n\nHawke leaned forward and tapped the prisoner on the knee.\n\n&quot;Did you hear any of their conversation?&quot;\n\nWilcox scratched his head and frowned.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;but they wasn&#39;t quarrellin&#39;. There certainly didn&#39;t seem to be no row on between &#39;em. Matey as could be, they was. Laughin&#39; and jokin&#39;, an&#39; Jones was slappin&#39; &#39;Enderson on the back like an old school chum.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Symbol of Revenge\n\nHawke and Tommy Burke went and interviewed Alfred Jones. He seemed to be both perplexed and troubled by what had happened to Henderson.\n\n&quot;When I walked up the lane on to the main road after leaving him,&quot; he said, &quot;I was rather preoccupied, and I don&#39;t recall seeing anybody pass me. I can&#39;t understand it at all. A cabbage impaled to his body with a stake! Incredible!\n\n&quot;Like,&quot; he went on, after a pause and passing his hand wearily over his forehead, &quot;like a — like a buttonhole?&quot; Hawke&#39;s brows rose slightly.\n\n&quot;Why, yes,&quot; he said. &quot;Now you come to put it like that. It certainly was in approximately the position of a buttonhole. What made you think of it in that way?&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, I dunno. Association of ideas, I suppose. I automatically associate Henderson with a buttonhole. He always wore one in the old days. He was noted for it in the district where we used to work. A different one every day he wore. Always a big one that made him a bit conspicuous. Something of a swaggerer he was in those days.&quot;\n\n&quot;Indeed. Then he had a few enemies?&quot;\n\n&quot;Plenty. Though, mind you, that was over ten years ago. He&#39;d altered since then, and nobody would have borne a grudge that long.&quot;\n\n&quot;Did – did you ever have a grudge against him?&quot;\n\nJones stared.\n\n&quot;I see your drift,&quot; he said, nodding. &quot;Well, I must admit that I did have a grudge against him — at one time. He was my boss. I mapped out my career, and, after I&#39;d slaved for years to get promotion, he stepped in above me and kicked me out. For a long time after that it seemed that everything I touched was bound to go wrong. All my savings went, and the worry of years of unemployment and uncertainty killed my wife. I really believe I could have done for him then.&quot;\n\n&quot;But you don&#39;t feel that way now?&quot; Jones shrugged.\n\n&quot;Life,&quot; he replied, &quot;is too big and too complex for petty hates.&quot;\n\nHe pointed through the window to a trek-cart in the backyard. It was loaded with hosepipes and poison-gas decontamination apparatus.\n\n&quot;The A.R.P. truck reflects my outlook,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m concerned with saving life, not destroying it.&quot;\n\nJones thus expressed himself with a certain dramatic force which did much to win the visitors to a belief in his sincerity.\n\n&quot;The elimination of Jones,&quot; said Hawke on their return to Dover Street, &quot;makes the case more puzzling than ever. Since he gave me that buttonhole idea, however. I&#39;ve been inclined to look on the cabbage as a symbol characteristic of a vendetta.&quot;\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n&quot;A symbol! Something to signalise revenge. It&#39;s the only possible explanation.&quot;\n\n&quot;It makes it a personal matter. The perpetrator has a close personal interest in the victim&#39;s life and death, and he may, therefore, be found amongst the victim&#39;s circle of acquaintances. The funeral is at Chiswick tomorrow. We&#39;ll attend it, and see if any lines of inquiry suggest themselves.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n&quot;Air Raid&quot; Danger\n\nThe funeral was a quiet affair, with only half a dozen mourners or so, and it seemed as though this approach to the case was yet another blind alley.\n\nAfter the people had dispersed, Hawke was moodily looking over the few wreaths which were stacked at the side of the open grave, when he suddenly stopped and pointed to one of the cards.\n\n&quot;&#39;In memory of an old friend,&#39;&quot; read Tommy over his shoulder. &quot;From well-wisher.&#39;&quot;\n\nHe looked inquiringly at his employer.\n\n&quot;An anonymous wreath,&quot; he remarked. &quot;But what does it signify?&quot;\n\nHawke pointed to a tiny imprint at the top of the card. This was the name of the florist who had supplied the wreath — Hector Robinson, of Hanford. At the side of the name was a pencilled date, thus — 17/6/39.\n\n&quot;The date!&quot; breathed Hawke. &quot;What do you think of it?&quot;\n\n&quot;The seventeenth,&quot; said Tommy, frowning.\n\n&quot;That was the day the man was murdered! He was murdered at six o&#39;clock at night, and, unless the assistant made a mistake, that wreath was ordered the same evening.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then the sender didn&#39;t lose much time –&quot;\n\n&quot;The sender knew of the death before the general public did. The florist&#39;s shop would close at seven or eight, and the affair wasn&#39;t reported until the third wireless bulletin at ten.&quot; Their inquiry at the florist&#39;s sent them up to Hanford Heath, where a scattered crowd had assembled about an ugly three-storied house, long deserted and scheduled for demolition. Hawke learned that it was to be bombed, and that dummies were to be &quot;rescued &quot; from the building after the &quot;raid &quot; by A.R.P. workers.\n\n&quot;You&#39;ll find Mr. Jones somewhere about the house,&quot; said an inspector. &quot;When the red flag goes up on the roof, the planes will start bombing the place. Keep a lookout for it.&quot;\n\nIt was some time before they located Jones. Each member of the A.R.P. party was occupied with his own duties, and had not time to keep track of everybody&#39;s whereabouts.\n\nMoreover, the house was surrounded by tall undergrowth, and it was approached by way of tortuous, concealed paths.\n\nFinally Hawke entered the dark, decaying old building and shouted for Jones.\n\nJones answered from an upstairs room, and the two visitors mounted the stairs.\n\nJones, covered with dust and plaster, had just lowered himself from a trapdoor in the ceiling on the top floor, and he did not seem able to comprehend the nature of Hawke&#39;s question:\n\n&quot;When did you first hear of Henderson&#39;s death?&quot;\n\n&quot;Why,&quot; said Jones, after a pause, during which he dusted his clothes with his hands, &quot;the following morning.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then how did you come to order a wreath from the florist&#39;s in Hanford on the same evening?&quot;\n\n&quot;The same evening?&quot;\n\nJones stared blankly, and it struck the other two that he genuinely did not understand.\n\n&quot;The florist knows you. And he remembers the time you called. It was within half an hour of the time when Henderson was killed.&quot;\n\nJones repeated that weary gesture which the others had noticed before, drawing his hand up over his forehead as though in an effort to smooth out his thoughts.\n\n&quot;The wreath,&quot; he said, moving into one of the back rooms. &quot;Yes, I did order a wreath. I remember ordering it. But I can&#39;t remember when. It all seems kind of blurred in my memory.&quot; He stared frowningly out of the window across the fields.\n\n&quot;Wreath,&quot; he said. &quot;Florists. Yes, that&#39;s right. But — when? What&#39;s it matter — when?&quot;\n\n&quot;It matters a great deal, I&#39;m afraid.&quot;\n\nAs Jones turned his vacant eye towards him the truth about him became apparent to Hawke. The man was insane.\n\nThe detective was about to speak when his attention was distracted by the droning of planes, and, looking out of the window, he saw three of them bank over in the distance and then head towards the house.\n\n&quot;I say! &quot; exclaimed Tommy. &quot;They&#39;re not going to start bombing yet, are they?&quot;\n\n&quot;Bombing?&quot;\n\nJones looked round slowly, stupidly. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, and then started violently, as though suddenly coming out of a reverie into harsh reality.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve hoisted the flag,&quot; he said. &quot;We must get out of here.&quot;\n\nBut it was much too late.\n\nThe planes had been approaching the house at two hundred miles an hour, and, as they turned and looked impotently out of the window, the three could see a cluster of tiny black dots in the air, descending from the undercarriage of the leading machine.\n\nHawke had dragged the other two back from the window on to the landing, when there was a tremendous crash, and the whole house seemed to tilt to one side, while an avalanche of masonry tumbled about their ears.\n\nThere was a quick succession of explosions, and then a blast of fierce heat from below.\n\nShining white globules from the incendiary bombs seemed to have been scattered to all parts of the house. They burnt with almost incredible intensity, and shrivelled and consumed the dry woodwork at amazing speed.\n\nPungent fumes and smoke belched up the stairway, and then came great blinding sheets of flame.\n\nThe rescue squad proved their efficiency much more convincingly than they could have done by rescuing dummies.\n\nThe begoggled, steel-helmeted men in asbestos suits who invaded the place almost immediately after the outbreak of fire were astounded at finding the three trapped victims, one of whom appeared badly injured, but they carried through their operations with commendable presence of mind.\n\nSinged, bruised, and half-suffocated, the three were carried down the ladders to safety, and presently lay on the grass, surrounded by a circle of police and firemen. Hawke and Tommy were sufficiently revived by the fresh air to be able to pay attention to Jones&#39;s last words.\n\nJones&#39;s face was blackened and blood was trickling from his mouth as he raised himself on an elbow from the stretcher on which he had been placed, and shouted — at no one in particular:\n\n&quot;The cabbage!&quot;\n\nHe laughed hysterically.\n\n&quot;I pulled it out of the allotment after I&#39;d knocked the dirty swine down. Ha, ha! What a card you were, Henderson, old pal! What a gay spark! Lemme get something to pin it on with. Ha! This stake. There!&quot;\n\nThere came another hysterical burst of laughter as the demented man made a savage downward thrust with his fist.\n\n&quot;There. Have a buttonhole!&quot; he gasped. &quot;Have a buttonhole, Henderson, old boy.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  A Lady To See You\n  The Lady Returns\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nA Lady To See You\n\nThere is a — lady outside who wishes to see you. There is a man with her.&quot;\n\n&quot;What&#39;s the name?&quot; Thornton asked, visibly annoyed at the untimely intrusion.\n\n&quot;She would give no name. She said you would not know her. She seems very anxious to see you.&quot;\n\nThornton reflected a few moments. It was rather early for callers, and he had been about to dictate his morning mail. He resented the visit, but, for some reason he could not fathom, he felt a slight curiosity as to the identity of his callers. He turned suddenly to his secretary.\n\n&quot;Show them in, Miss Armstrong, please.&quot;\n\nAs the pair entered, Thornton&#39;s curiosity was increased.\n\nThe woman was about thirty years of age and strikingly attractive. She was expensively gowned and bore all the earmarks of wealth, but her companion was rather shabbily dressed and impressed one as a servant of the woman. The woman entered first, the man following behind her slowly, almost timidly. Thornton noticed that he clutched in his hand a large, square, box-like affair covered with black cloth.\n\n&quot;Mr. Thornton?&quot; the woman gushed, advancing with a friendliness that was almost brazen.\n\nThornton arose, wonderingly. &quot;I&#39;m afraid you have the advantage of  –&quot;\n\n&quot;I am Miss Bender — Miss Ruth Bender,&quot; the caller beamed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;ve chosen a busy moment to intrude, but I&#39;m sure you will pardon me when the nature of my visit is made known.&quot;\n\nThornton motioned his visitor to a seat, and, as she drew up a chair, looked up questioningly at her companion. She seemed to have forgotten the man, and she now turned toward him in sudden remembrance.\n\n&quot;Just take a chair, Mr. Parker,&quot; she said, making no move to introduce her companion, who was standing some few feet away, gazing stupidly about the room and shifting from one foot to the other. He made no effort to put down the cloth-covered object he was holding.\n\nAt the sound of the woman&#39;s voice, the man turned dully, found a chair and sat down, making no move to draw the chair closer, evidently not considering himself a party to the conference. He held the black box on his lap and seemed to handle it with extraordinary care.\n\nThe woman turned to Thornton.\n\n&quot;I suppose you&#39;re wondering at the reason for my call,&quot; she began.\n\nThornton smiled, non-committally.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s something of the greatest importance,&quot; the stranger continued, &quot;so I chose a time when I thought we would be least likely to be interrupted. It&#39;s of a very confidential nature. We will not be disturbed?&quot;\n\nThornton found himself wondering just what it was about the woman that he did not like, but she had now aroused his curiosity and he determined to give her an audience. He rang for his secretary.\n\n&quot;Will you see that I am not disturbed for the next ten minutes,&quot; he said to Miss Armstrong, when she entered.\n\nThe girl nodded assent and withdrew.\n\nWhen the door had closed, the woman turned to Thornton, rather mysteriously.\n\n&quot;Mr. Thornton, as a live-wire business man, I believe you&#39;re interested in any legitimate proposition promising unusually large financial rewards?&quot; she began.\n\nThornton breathed a sigh of relief, tinged with disappointment. The woman&#39;s manner and method of approach had whetted his curiosity and expectations, but he now prepared to listen to the usual harangue of the expert stock salesman.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll warn you beforehand,&quot; he interrupted, &quot;I&#39;m not interested in stocks of any nature.&quot;\n\nThe woman smiled knowingly. &quot;I haven&#39;t come to sell you any stock, Mr. Thornton. The proposition I have in mind is something bigger, better, surer. The rewards are — well, tremendous!&quot;\n\nShe leaned forward suddenly, with an air of utmost confidence. Her voice was almost a whisper, and she glanced occasionally at the man who had accompanied her and who was busy fixing the mysterious box in a comfortable position on his lap.\n\n&quot;Mr. Thornton,&quot; the woman said, in a low voice, &quot;that man there has a device that is destined to earn tremendous rewards for its owners!&quot;\n\nThornton glanced at the box on the man&#39;s lap with renewed interest.\n\n&quot;What is it?&quot; he asked.\n\n&quot;That I cannot divulge at this time. If you are interested. I&#39;ll have him explain in detail. It is his own invention, and naturally he is very jealous of his secret. He will let no one into the secret unless there is a probability of their being interested.&quot;\n\n&quot;Like all inventors,&quot; she went on, &quot;he is in need of financial assistance. If he should show his device to you now, you would grasp the secret immediately. Our proposition is this, it will require a considerable amount of capital to float this thing properly, but when you once learn the secret, you will readily agree that it is the surest investment a man could possibly make. The question is not whether it is a sure or risky investment — there is no doubt of its feasibility — but a question solely of finances. It will take considerable money, and we do not wish to take up your time or our own unless you are readily able to handle a proposition of this size.&quot;\n\n&quot;That would, of course, depend entirely upon my own opinion of its merit,&quot; Thornton replied, mystified and curious to learn the nature of the device.\n\n&quot;Certainly, Mr. Thornton!&quot; the woman returned. &quot;We could hardly expect anyone to interest themselves in something they have no confidence in. But it is not a question of confidence —  the moment you learn the secret, you&#39;ll agree with us that the potential rewards in it are tremendous! Now, granting that you are interested, would you be able to finance a proposition requiring a considerable sum of money? Could you lay your hands on — say — fifty thousand dollars cash at any moment?&quot;\n\n&quot;Double that amount, if the proposition is worth it!&quot; Thornton replied, now really anxious to learn more about the mysterious box on the stranger&#39;s lap.\n\n&quot;Good !&quot; the woman answered, enthusiastically. She turned to the man who had accompanied her. &quot;Mr. Parker, will you demonstrate your device to Mr. Thornton?&quot;\n\nThe man arose and stood by his chair as he fumbled with several little contrivances on the mysterious box. He made no effort to advance closer to Thornton&#39;s desk.\n\nThe woman leaned closer to Thornton confidentially and whispered to him. &quot;He&#39;s suspicious of everyone. He won&#39;t show you the complete details now, but you&#39;ll learn enough when you see it in operation. It will surprise you, I assure you!&quot;\n\nThe man was facing directly toward Thornton, as he fumbled in his pockets for an object which he laid on the top of the box. A false lid was raised, and Thornton could not see what the object was that the man placed on the box, for the upraised lid hid it from view.\n\nThe man seemed to have trouble in working some of the mysterious parts, for he finally laid the box on the chair by his side, to give him entire freedom of both hands. He bent down over the box for a few seconds while he worked with something behind the upraised lid.\n\nSuddenly, the woman at Thornton&#39;s side uttered a half-smothered shriek and clasped her hind to her heart. Thornton turned quickly in alarm. The woman&#39;s eyes were widely dilated for a moment, as if in extreme agony, then she suddenly slumped over in a faint. She would have fallen but Thornton quickly reached out his arm and caught her. He supported her in his arms while he looked up at the man.\n\n&quot;Get me some water, quick! This woman has fainted!&#39;&#39;\n\nThe man seemed to grasp the situation instantly, for he immediately turned and hurried toward the door leading into the outer office. As he did so, there was a sudden blinding flash of light from the mysterious box on the chair.\n\nEvents in the next few moments happened with dramatic rapidity. The man turned suddenly at the flash of light, grabbed the mysterious box and hurried out of the office. The unconscious woman in Thornton&#39;s arms suddenly revived, fixed her slightly disarrayed hat and gown, and arose to take her departure.\n\nShe smiled amusedly at the thoroughly mystified and dumbstruck Thornton.\n\n&quot;I thank you so much for the audience, Mr. Thornton,&quot; she smiled, &quot;but I do not want to take up any more of your time than is absolutely necessary. We&#39;ll return at this time tomorrow —  with the photograph.&quot;\n\n&quot;Photograph?&quot; Thornton repeated, the light of comprehension entering his eyes.\n\n&quot;Yes, provided, of course, that it proves to be a good one. If it should not turn out clearly enough, we won&#39;t bother you again.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then that  —  mysterious invention was a — &quot;\n\n&quot;Camera,&quot; the woman smiled mockingly. &quot;It seldom fails. We&#39;ve taken some wonderfully good photographs with it.&quot;\n\nConvinced now that the woman&#39;s motives were ulterior, Thornton confronted her with a feeling of resentment at having been tricked so easily.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m a busy man, Miss — Bender. Give me your proposition in as few words as possible,&quot; he said, curtly.\n\nShe seemed gallingly oblivious to his scorn. &quot;We expect to have a very good photograph of you, Mr. Thornton —  with me in your arms. It&#39;s merely a question of who considers that photograph of greater value — you or — Mrs. Thornton. We consider it worth to you at least five thousand dollars. That shouldn&#39;t be a staggering sum to a man who can lay his hands on fifty thousand cash at any moment he desires.&quot;\n\n&quot;And suppose I — don&#39;t consider it worth — or, rather, suppose I refuse to pay the blackmail?&quot;\n\n&quot;Then, of course, I shall make the best bargain possible with Mrs. Thornton. I&#39;m giving you first option.&quot;\n\n&quot;So generous of you,&quot; Thornton smiled, scornfully.\n\nShe seemed entirely unabashed and stood waiting expectantly, as if never doubting the final acceptance of her offer.\n\nThornton was interested in the woman&#39;s methods; she seemed so confident of herself.\n\n&quot;Tell me,&quot; he said, interestedly, &quot;is this an — everyday occurrence with you?&quot;\n\nShe smiled reprovingly.\n\n&quot;Rich men are not so plentiful, Mr. Thornton. Besides, we must pick our time. I never take chances — I always make sure of my ground first. You will notice I chose a time when you would be least likely to have any callers.&quot;\n\n&quot;But why all the rigmarole about the mysterious invention?&quot; he persisted.\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t seem to conquer my love for dramatics, Mr. Thornton,&quot; the woman replied, smiling sheepishly. &quot;I once followed the profession, you know, until I discovered there were greater returns in my present one. Besides, it is rather difficult to prepare to take a flashlight in a man&#39;s office without exciting his suspicion. The curtain covering the lens of the camera, you will recall, was not drawn back until the exact moment before the charge of powder was ignited. All a matter of mechanism,&quot; she explained, rather proudly.\n\n&quot;I suppose the — returns — are very gratifying?&quot; he queried, noticing a huge diamond on her finger.\n\n&quot;I have no complaint,&quot; she replied, not taken back in the slightest. &quot;Sometimes it is — rather embarrassing — but I try to cause as little trouble as possible.&quot;\n\n&quot;And is that part of your returns?&quot;\n\nThornton asked, pointing to the stone on her hand which was flashing brilliantly in the early morning sunlight.\n\nShe gazed proudly at the diamond.\n\n&quot;Isn&#39;t it gorgeous?&quot; she said, enthusiastically.\n\nThornton knew enough of precious stones to realize that the ring must have cost several thousand dollars. The diamond was extraordinarily large and of very fine cut.\n\nThe woman turned suddenly to go.\n\n&quot;Well, Mr. Thornton, I know you&#39;re a busy man, so I won&#39;t take up any more of your time — today. If we have been unfortunate in our photography, we will not bother you again. If it comes up to our expectations, I shall return tomorrow at this time for your decision.&quot;\n\nThornton bowed her out, admiring, in spite of himself, the woman&#39;s self-possession and complete confidence.\n\nA few moments later he rang for his secretary, anxious to get his day&#39;s mail off his mind, so that he could give thought to the new problem that had thrust itself upon him. He waited a few moments and was surprised that Miss Armstrong was not as prompt as usual in answering.\n\nHe looked into the outer office and found her at her desk, gazing dreamily out the window, apparently oblivious to her surroundings.\n\nHe called her wonderingly. She rose with a start, and, smiling sheepishly, followed him into his office.\n\n&quot;Day dreaming?&quot; he asked, smiling.\n\nMiss Armstrong laughed, rather shamefacedly. &quot;Yes, and a very foolish thing to dream about. I was picturing myself wearing the ring worn by the lady who just left.&quot;\n\n&quot;It was a beauty, wasn&#39;t it ?&quot; he conceded.\n\n&quot;Oh, it was wonderful!&quot; his secretary exclaimed, with beaming eyes.\n\nFrom the expression on the girl&#39;s face, Thornton could understand how some women sold their souls for less expensive baubles.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Lady Returns\n\nPromptly at ten-thirty the next morning, Miss Bender called and was ushered immediately into Thornton&#39;s private office.\n\nThornton nodded a pleasant greeting and offered her a chair. He noticed a large envelope in her hand and surmised that it contained the photograph. He glanced up at her expectantly.\n\n&quot;I have good news, Mr. Thornton,&quot; Miss Bender smiled, &#39;&#39;that is, good news if you look at it from my viewpoint.&quot; &quot;You succeeded in getting a good photograph ?&quot;\n\n&quot;Excellent! It could not be clearer!&quot; He found himself wondering why he was able to joke so pleasantly with this woman, who had so easily tricked him and then laughed at his stupidity.\n\n&quot;Now, would you mind giving me your proposition in detail, Miss — &quot;\n\n&quot;There is nothing that I did not tell you yesterday, Mr. Thornton,&quot; she interrupted. &quot;I have the photograph here which my assistant took yesterday. It is a first class likeness of yourself, holding me in your arms. I believe it should be worth at least five thousand dollars to you. If you don&#39;t agree with me, then I shall strike a bargain with Mrs. Thornton for it — and I&#39;m sure it would interest her!&quot;\n\n&quot;And if I pay you this five thousand dollars, what is to prevent you from — &quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll give you the negative also, and my word of honor that I shall make no further attempt to use the incident against you.&quot;\n\nThornton smiled at the reference to her &quot;word of honor.&quot;\n\n&quot;You realize, I suppose,&quot; he said, slowly and with emphasis, &quot;that this is pure blackmail?&#39;&#39;\n\n&quot;Please don&#39;t use that word, Mr. Thornton!&quot; the woman returned, mockingly. &quot;There are so many nicer ways of expressing it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Would you mind allowing me to see what I am asked to pay such a sum of money for?&quot; Thornton said, changing the subject abruptly.\n\nHis visitor obligingly produced the photograph and handed it over. From the attitude of the two in the picture, it certainly would be conclusive evidence in any divorce court. Thornton gazed at it a few moments, smiling enigmatically, then turned to his desk and picked up a large envelope. Placing the photograph inside, he silently addressed the envelope and sealed it.\n\nHis visitor scented trickery. &quot;Just a reminder, Mr. Thornton, that you haven&#39;t paid for the photograph yet, and another reminder that I still have the negative and can make as many duplicates as I choose.&quot;\n\nThornton made no reply, but turned and faced the door leading into his outer office.\n\n&quot;Have you everything so far, Miss Armstrong?&quot; he asked, without raising his voice.\n\nThe woman turned quickly, on her guard, but she saw no one. The man at the desk was evidently talking to the wall. She glanced hurriedly about the office, then turned and stared wonderingly at Thornton.\n\nThree short, sharp knocks sounded on the outer door.\n\nThornton smiled.\n\n&quot;You may cut the wires now, Miss Armstrong, please,&quot; he said pleasantly.\n\nTwo short knocks sounded on the door, in answer to his instructions.\n\nThornton turned to his caller. &quot;Now, Miss — Bender, is it? — I want to thank you for the photograph and compliment you on the excellence of the work.&quot;\n\nThe woman&#39;s lips curled in contempt, and she laughed carelessly, evidently confident of herself.\n\n&quot;I must warn you again, Mr. Thornton, that I still have the negative. It&#39;s a matter of a few minutes to make a duplicate of that photograph.&quot;\n\nThornton ignored her remark as he continued. &quot;I will admit that I consider the photograph easily worth the amount you ask, but as long as it is not necessary to purchase it, why should I?&quot;\n\nThe woman arose, furious, and prepared to make her departure.\n\n&#39;&#39;Just a moment, please,&quot; Thornton said, quietly, &quot;I&#39;ll have to ask my secretary to unlock the door before you can go.&quot;\n\nThe woman rushed angrily to the door, for she believed Thornton was bluffing. She tried the knob and found the door locked.\n\nShe turned to the man at the desk with challenging eyes.\n\n&quot;Well, what&#39;s the game?&quot; she panted, her first doubts beginning to assail her sense of security.\n\n&quot;Won&#39;t you sit down a few moments?&quot; Thornton said, smiling at her discomfiture.\n\nMiss Bender obeyed, then turned as if waiting for his next move.\n\n&quot;I think you told me your — profession was a very well paid one?&quot; he began.\n\nHis visitor glared at him venomously and made no reply.\n\n&quot;Assuming that your words are true, I should think your liberty would be worth something to you.&quot;\n\nMiss Bender turned, her face ugly in its mask of baffled rage.\n\n&quot;You can turn me over to the police, but a copy of that photograph will be in Mrs. Thornton&#39;s hands tomorrow!&quot; she cried, furiously. &quot;My assistant will attend to that! And what I will swear to on the witness stand will be plenty!&quot;\n\nThornton smiled at her anger. Somehow he felt a curious sense of pleasure in playing with her, as a cat does before eating the mouse it has caught.\n\n&quot;My secretary has taken down every word that has passed between us this morning,&quot; he resumed.\n\nHe arose and pulled aside a large picture hanging on the wall.\n\nThe woman turned and saw a dictaphone, and knew the man was not bluffing.\n\n&quot;You realize, I suppose, that it is within my power to — &quot;\n\n&quot;Well, what&#39;s your proposition?&quot; the blackmailer demanded, impatiently.\n\nThornton reached over and pointed to the ring on her finger. &quot;If you consider a half-hour&#39;s work worth five thousand dollars, wouldn&#39;t you consider your liberty worth — that ring?&quot;\n\nThe woman seemed dumbstruck at his words.\n\n&quot;Why, it&#39;s preposterous!&quot; she exclaimed, seething with fury.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s according to the viewpoint you adopt,&quot; Thornton replied, quietly, with a note of triumphant mockery in his voice. &quot;I&#39;m busy, Miss Bender, but I&#39;ll grant you ten minutes to make your decision. Hand over that ring on your finger, and I&#39;ll give you your freedom and make no attempt at prosecution for your attempted blackmail. Otherwise, I shall be compelled to telephone for the police.&quot;\n\nAfter a few minutes&#39; deliberation, the woman suddenly tore the ring from her finger and threw it angrily on his desk. An almost imperceptible sob escaped her lips.\n\nThornton picked up the ring and placed it in his pocket. &quot;Before you go, Miss Bender, I want to add to your disappointment by telling you that Mrs. Thornton would gladly have given you five thousand dollars for that photograph! That dictaphone you saw behind the picture was placed there by detectives in the employ of Mrs. Thornton. She suspected that I was in love with my secretary. I pretended ignorance and allowed the instrument to remain, though I knew of its presence from the beginning. It was an easy matter to run in another wire for my stenographer yesterday, in readiness for your return.&quot;\n\nHe pressed the button on his desk and Miss Armstrong unlocked the door and entered.\n\nHe handed her the envelope containing the photograph.\n\n&quot;Will you please mail that for me at once, Miss Armstrong? And register it, please?&quot;\n\nThe girl took the package and left the office.\n\nThe woman took advantage of her opportunity and gained the safety of the outer office. She turned and glared evilly at Thornton.\n\n&quot;Well, Mr. Thornton, for your trickery I&#39;ll reward you by telling you that Mrs. Thornton will receive a copy of that photograph in tomorrow morning&#39;s mail!&quot;\n\n&quot;Which won&#39;t particularly interest her,&quot; Thornton replied, smilingly, &quot;as she will receive the original in this afternoon&#39;s mail. My secretary has just mailed it to her by registered mail.&quot;\n\n&quot;You mailed that to — your wife?&quot; the woman gasped, incredulously.\n\n&quot;Certainly. You see, Miss Bender, a divorce is the best thing that could possibly be handed to both Mrs. Thornton and myself. Our marriage is one that was never destined to last. It has survived this long only because of lack of sufficient grounds for divorce. And would not think of bringing any unpleasant notoriety to any lady — until you obligingly handed me what both Mrs. Thornton and myself have been seeking for months! Good day, and thank you so much!&quot;\n\nThe woman stormed out of the office, furious at the circumstances that had robbed her of the large sum she had expected and nettled at the taunting mockery in her intended victim&#39;s voice.\n\nA few minutes later Miss Armstrong returned. She handed her employer the postal receipt for the registered package.\n\n&quot;Got it off all right?&quot; he smiled.\n\n&quot;Yes, it will probably be delivered this afternoon.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good!&quot; He smiled rather anxiously. He turned suddenly to the girl. &quot;Vallance, what was it you were day dreaming over yesterday when you didn&#39;t hear my ring for dictation?&quot;\n\nThe girl gazed at him in smiling uncertainty for a moment, the incident not coming to her instantly.\n\n&quot;Oh, about the ring that woman was wearing,&quot; she replied, laughing sheepishly.\n\n&quot;Well, it was one day dream that came true,&quot; Thornton said, reaching in his vest pocket.\n\nHe withdrew his hand and placed the ring on her finger. The girl&#39;s eyes widened in astonishment, as she stared at the sparkling stone in disbelief.\n\n&quot;Why, it&#39;s just like the one that —  woman wore!&quot; she breathed in rapt admiration. &quot;The stone is fully as large!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, it does resemble it somewhat, doesn&#39;t it ?&quot; Thornton smiled significantly.\n\n~ The End ~\n\n"

By lucky chance, he found the service hall empty. He entered the elevator, closed the door, and punched the button for a stop at the fourth floor. Danny’s bachelor suite was on the fifth.\n\nHe would have had a story ready, if seen, but it was better that he did not have to use it. When he got his bag packed now, he could go down in the service elevator; if he met the janitor, Danny would toss off a remark about wanting to cut through the alley because he was in a hurry.\n\nThe janitor would not think the move unusual. Danny Blure had been a tenant for more than three years, had always paid rent on time, and tipped generously. The janitor would not think he was skipping with a few clothes and leaving an unpaid bill.\n\nBut that was what he would be doing—skipping. Not from an unpaid rent bill. He would be skipping from the menace of violent death, which now hovered over him and seemed to press him down with an overpowering weight.\n\nThe elevator stopped at the floor. Danny tried to compose himself before opening the door. He might encounter someone here, though this was an hour when the maids would have their regular tasks done and be gone. He took a deep breath in an effort to control his trembling, tried to wipe the set look of a man in terror out of his face.\n\nNobody was in the little service hall. Danny went quickly and almost silently up the rear stairs to the fifth floor. Nobody was there. He peered along the hallway at the door of his own apartment; he gave a sigh of relief when he saw the hallway was empty.\n\nSo far, he was safe. Now he would hurry into his apartment and lock the door. He would pack swiftly, get down in the service elevator, walk out of the apartment house—and disappear. It would be dusk when he emerged, the best hour for safety.\n\nDanny got his door key out of his pocket to have it ready, for he did not want to linger in the hallway a second more than necessary; one of Fox Agnew’s killers might spot him. One of those hopped-up, cold-blooded, inhuman triggermen might sneer at him and begin emptying an automatic into his body.\n\nHis hands were clammy as he hurried along the corridor. He was licking at lips dried by the heat of terror. Like a wild animal, Danny flinched at the slightest sound that might warn of danger.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nFox Agnew’s Gang\n\nWhy had he done it? Why had he tried to go it alone? He might have known that Fox and the gang would suspect him some day, prove his guilt to their satisfaction, give him a facetious warning, then blast life out of his body.\n\nHe didn’t believe Fox Agnew knew of the little apartment be had here; Danny had two homes. One was in an apartment house in another section of the city, a place where men and women came and went much as they pleased. This one was an ultra-respectable place; it was the address on the books of the firm for which Danny worked.\n\nIn both places, he was known as a salesman of women’s expensive lingerie, which he was, really. Danny worked under his own name. His commissions gave him a splendid living, for the goods he sold were fashionable, exclusive fine merchandise at high prices. His clientele was composed of young women of fashion and social position and wealth, and older women with wealth enough to ape the younger women’s ways. And the firm for which he worked was an importing company of high integrity.\n\nDanny called on these women by request, after their interest had been solicited by the firm itself. He was tall, and women called him handsome. He had a low, well-modulated voice that aroused thoughts of romance in women; they bought double when Danny Blure showed them his samples.\n\nThey did not know, nor did his firm, that Blure had a sideline which netted him far more than his honest commissions, and which, for obvious reasons, was not revealed on his income tax report.\n\nTwo years before, he had made the acquaintance of Fox Agnew, believing it accidental and not knowing it had been contrived cleverly by Fox. Agnew and his boys were well known to the police; occasionally one of his boys was caught wrong, and even Fox’s expensive mouthpiece could not save him. But Fox himself always escaped; the police knew, but could not prove.\n\nDanny Blure’s acquaintance with Fox had resulted in a deal. Danny wanted money, and plenty of it. He worked in an atmosphere of wealth, and the odor of it was in his nostrils. These wealthy women to whom he sold lingerie … women with fortunes in jewels, perfume at a dollar a drop, with gowns and hats bearing Paris labels, silly women tossing money around! Their men with club memberships and yachts and seats on the Exchange! Why should they have so much and Blure so little?\n\nFox Agnew had whispered to him how he could get an abundance of money easily, and without danger to himself. He had only to keep his eyes open in the houses and apartments he visited on business. He had only to report certain things to Fox—where jewels were kept; how rooms were arranged; the number and habits of servants—things like that.\n\nFox had his working gang, both men and women, and they would do the rest. They would follow up Danny’s relayed information by making a raid. Sometimes it would be only a passkey job, and at other times a party stickup. And Danny would get his percentage in a way that would not incriminate him.\n\nSo Danny Blure became associated with the Fox Agnew gang.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nNever Satisfied\n\nIt had paid him well from the start. He kept his criminal sideline independent of his regular business. He continued to turn in more orders and build up his legitimate commissions. The more places of wealth to which he gained an entree, the more valuable information he had to send to Agnew.\n\nBut Danny Blure was of the never-satisfied type. Why take a small percentage when he could get it all? He had decided that in some cases the danger would be small; he wouldn’t try to sever relations with Fox Agnew, for that would invite suspicion and possibly disaster. But he could go it alone occasionally, take on another sideline.\n\nIn a clever hiding place in this bachelor suite of his in a respectable building, he had all the money Agnew had given him. Danny had not spent or flashed it; he had sense enough to live well within his legitimate income, so any investigation—if it ever came to that—would reveal nothing suspicious.\n\nHe wanted to amass a big stake, so he could go away to some place where he was not known and live like a young prince for a time. He had a vision of marrying some rich woman and having it easy the remainder of his life.\n\nFox Agnew, Blure felt sure, was a man who could not be fooled long; Fox would consider any outside moves to be rank treason, and would send his boys to exact a terrible punishment. So there remained for Danny the necessity for making one big haul. He decided he would work toward that end, would put the loot into his hiding place with the money Agnew had given him from time to time, and which he had not banked— remembering the income tax report.\n\nThen, he would go on as usual for a time, and finally disappear, market his loot, and travel. He would be smart.\n\nWithout doubt, the police were continually watching Fox and his associates. They might possibly have the idea that the Agnew gang was responsible for a wave of jewel thefts and party holdups. As a farewell gesture, then, Danny would pin his crime on one of the Agnew gang, and keep himself in the clear.\n\nHe had contacted Fox Agnew only by telephone since their deal, and his percentages had been delivered to him in cash, small bills, by a clever method. There was nothing to link him to the gang.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nAn Independent Job\n\nThe go-between Fox had contact him at times met Danny in a cafe. The go-between was nervous, and as they talked and the money was slipped to Danny, the nervous go-between pared his nails with a little gold knife.\n\nWhen they parted, the go-between was careless enough to leave the knife on the table. Danny had been watching for such a chance; he picked the knife up carefully with his handkerchief and put it into his pocket.\n\nNow he was all set for the big knock-off. He had spotted his prospective victim. She was a Mrs. Matilda Doring, a silly old woman who lived with a gadding niece, who left jewels scattered around, who ogled him and sent for him repeatedly.\n\nDanny had been in the apartment so much that he knew it as well as the servants, who were two maids. He knew the servants’ day off duty. And he knew that Mrs. Doring was half wrecked by arthritis and had cancelled all social engagements while under medical treatment.\n\nThe right moment came. The niece was away for the weekend; Mrs. Doring would be alone on her servant’s night off. Danny knew how to get into the apartment with small risk of being seen.\n\nHe had clothing he had purchased at a second-hand store, the sort he never wore. He had a close-fitting reddish wig that would show beneath the brim of his hat. He had a thick handkerchief made into a mask, with small holes for the eyes.\n\nIt had not been difficult to get to the door of her apartment and ring without being seen. As Mrs. Doring came slowly to the door, shuffling like a half-crippled person, Blure slipped the mask up over his face. When she pulled the door open, she saw the masked man holding a gun that menaced her.\n\nDanny was inside and had a hand clapped over her mouth before she could scream. He kicked the door shut behind him and heard the latch-lock snap into place. He thrust Mrs. Doring into her chair and stood before her, his eyes blazing, using a voice not his natural own when he spoke:\n\n“Get me your jewels and money—quick! Hand ‘em over to me, lady! You want to go on livin’, don’t you?”\n\nTrembling and on the verge of collapse, Mrs. Doring opened a wall safe in her bedchamber and let Danny help himself to jewels and money. He thrust the loot into a coat pocket and ordered Mrs. Doring back into the living room of the apartment.\n\nIt had been easy, he was thinking; now he had only to get out of the place and away without being seen. The apartment was on the second floor on the side of the building. Danny had come up a fire escape that extended entirely to the ground, and from the fire escape had walked into the hall and to the apartment’s front door. He would leave by the same route.\n\nHe compelled Mrs. Doring to sit in the chair again. “I’ll have to tie and gag you, ma’am,” Danny told her, in the false voice he was using.\n\nThat frightened her more than what had happened already. Her voice was raised in alarmed protest: “No-no t-that—!”\n\nThe sound of her shrill voice brought terror to Danny. In a frenzy of fear at discovery, he struck once with the gun to silence her, struck her on the side of the head. Mrs. Doring toppled off the chair to the floor and sprawled.\n\nDanny whirled toward the door, listened there a moment, beard no sound in the hall. He stepped back and took the gold knife from his pocket and shook it out of the protecting handkerchief. The fingerprints on it would give the police a lead in the wrong direction, he thought.\n\nHe opened the door cautiously and saw the hallway empty. Removing his mask, he closed the door and hurried to the fire escape and went down it rapidly. In a few minutes he was in the dear, a distance down the street.\n\nFear began leaving him His pockets were stuffed with loot, but he felt sure that Mrs. Doring had not recognized him. The unusual clothes, the false voice and wig, had protected him; now, all Blure had to do was get home and store his loot in the secret hiding place.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nA Killer\n\nThe following morning, he went to work as usual, his nerves quiet again. He got his samples and a list of prospects the firm furnished him, and started out. At a corner newsstand, he bought a late edition of a morning paper and scanned it rapidly as the taxi carried him toward his first customer of the day.\n\nTerror struck him again. He read out Mrs. Matilda Doring had been found dead by one of the maids. She had been killed by a blow on her head, the report said; the wall safe in her bedchamber was open and empty of jewels and money.\n\nDanny Blure had a sudden attack of nausea. He made a fight to control himself. He feared the taxi driver might glance in the rear-vision mirror and see the guilt in his face. He tossed the newspaper aside as if it had been something impregnated with poison.\n\n“Changed my mind—stop at the next corner,” he told the driver.\n\nThe taxi turned in to the curb. Danny’s hand was shaking as he paid his fare and mumbled something about forgetting to attend to an important telephone call. He picked up his sample case and walked swiftly along a side street.\n\nIn a small, secluded cafe, he sat at a table and ordered a drink, and got out his prospect list and pretended to be studying it. He wanted time to think, to control his attack of nervousness. He was a killer! He had struck the old lady too hard; theft was bad enough, but now he was a killer!\n\nHe remembered the knife he had dropped. The owner of that knife had a police record, and his fingerprints were on file. It wouldn’t take the police long to pick him up. He would be blamed for robbery and not Danny Blure. If the man had even a legitimate alibi, the police would scoff and say it had been arranged in advance.\n\nHe, Danny Blure, had nothing to fear. The loot was well hidden. He would wait for a time, and then quit his job and disappear as he had planned.\n\nDanny knew he was in no condition to visit prospective customers and take orders. He couldn’t keep his mind on his work; he wouldn’t be able to exert upon women customers the charm that brought him success. So he would simply kill the day somewhere, he decided, and return to the office with no sales to report, as happened occasionally.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA Gun &amp;amp; Angry Eyes\n\nWhen he did return to the office in the evening, he found on his desk an office note to call a number he did not know. Danny called it. But it was not the voice of some woman eager to buy lingerie that came to him over the wire.\n\nIt was the stern voice of Fox Agnew saying, “Listen, Danny! … You had to do a double-cross on me, did you? … Not satisfied with your percentage … Had to try it alone …!”\n\n“Wh—what—?” Danny stammered.\n\n“Listen to me carefully, Danny. The cops picked up one of my boys. My mouthpiece has talked to him. He’s facing a murder rap, Danny— facing the hot seat. You did that; he’s a good boy—”\n\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Danny broke in.\n\n“Cut that kind of chatter, you punk! That knife you planted…my boy remembered he had left it on the cafe table when he parted from you. And we’ve been watching you, Danny. We’ve been a little suspicious of you.”\n\n“But I—I don’t know—”\n\n“Keep your ears open and your mouth shut, Danny. My boys are after you now; you’re going to get it, punk! You don’t know when or where, but you’ll get it. Maybe you’ll see a gun muzzle, and angry eyes above it, and that’s the last you’ll ever see.”\n\nWith a trembling hand, Danny replaced the phone on its cradle as the connection was broken. He was thankful nobody was near to see him, for he knew his face revealed his terror. He got out of the office and the building, glancing behind often, like a fugitive.\n\nThere was but one thing for him to do now…get home, get the loot, get out of town and keep going. He could market the jewels sometime in the future; he had plenty of cash to pay traveling expenses…\n\n\n\nSo here he was safely at home, without having been seen entering. He listened at the door of his suite as he fumbled with his key. Not the least sound came from inside. Perhaps Agnew did not know of Blure’s apartment in this respectable house; perhaps Fox’s gunmen were watching the other place.\n\nDanny unlocked the door and pulled it open, glanced through the entry hall quickly, closed the door again and stepped into his living room.\n\n“Freeze!” a low stern voice ordered.\n\nDanny’s eyes focused on the muzzle of a gun that seemed to approach him and grow larger in size. A touch of light glinted from it. Danny’s body seemed suddenly ossified by shock, his mind to stand still in its thinking.\n\nHe couldn’t take his eyes from the gun muzzle. He expected to see a spurt of flame and gas through which a slug of metal would be hurled to tear the life from his body. He drew in his breath in a sharp sob.\n\nHe raised his eyes slowly, taking his sight away from the gun muzzle. He looked into another pair of eyes that glittered blackly from beneath lids almost closed—the eyes of a killer. One of Agnew’s boys, he thought. Then, Fox must have known of his apartment here.\n\n“You…you…” Danny mouthed.\n\n“Take it easy, and be quiet!” the man who held the gun cautioned. “You walked in on me, chum; this is a stickup.”\n\n“Stickup—?” Danny acted like a man who did not quite understand.\n\n“That’s right. I came in with my little passkey and went through your place, and I didn’t find much. Years ago, gents had jewelry, but now they don’t use it so much. It’s tough for a man in my line. So I’ll have to go through you and see if I can find a wallet. Face the wall, chum, and get your hands up.”\n\nDanny was shocked by bewilderment, scarcely capable of thought and action. Only a passkey thief, and he had believed this visitor to be one of Fox Agnew’s boys. Then he had a quick suspicion that the man really was one of Fox’s gang, and that he would shoot as soon as Danny turned his back.\n\n“No…no…” Danny muttered.\n\n“Flatten against that wall, chum!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nI’m No Killer\n\nDanny reeled back the wall, put up his hands trembling as he pressed them against the wall’s surface. The man’s hands exploring his body. His wallet was taken, also the gun he wore in a shoulder holster.\n\n“So you’re packin’ a rod,” the man said.\n\n“I—I’m a salesman—got a permit.”\n\n“That’s all right with me, chum. Wish I had a permit.” He tossed Danny’s gun into a corner of the room and made Danny turn and walk to a chair and sit. Standing a few feet away, he leafed through Danny’s wallet and extracted some currency.\n\n“This haul isn’t paying me for my trouble,” he complained. ‘Let’s go into your bedroom now. I’ll have to tie you up so I can make a getaway; you’ve seen my face, and could identify me. But I’m no killer.”\n\nDanny was compelled to go into the bedroom. He was forced to stretch out on his face while the passkey thief took off Danny’s belt and fastened his wrists behind his back with it. Then he turned Danny over and gagged him with a handkerchief. And finally he lashed Danny’s legs from feet to knees with strips from a sheet taken from the bed, and tied his ankles to the bedposts.\n\n“That’ll keep you quiet and busy long enough for me to get away,” the passkey thief said. “Sorry, chum, but it’s your fault for walking in on me as you did.”\n\nHe left the bedroom, and Danny heard the hall door opened and closed. Stretched there, he realized that his body was bathed in cold sweat.\n\nA surge of relief came to him, and his terror left him.\n\nDanny was still safe. Now he could get his loot from the hiding place, pack a bag quickly, get away.\n\nAgnew might have his boys watching the airport, so he wouldn’t try to take a plane; Blure decided to go to the edge of the city and catch a bus going in any direction, and travel until he could make a long hop by train or plane.\n\nThe passkey thief had been careless fastening his victim’s wrists with the belt, for Danny found he could reach the buckle with his fingers. It was difficult to get the buckle unfastened, but he accomplished it. He tossed the belt aside, sat up on the bed and got his legs and feet free, reeled out upon the floor.\n\nHe put on his belt, went to a small table in a corner of the bedroom and poured himself a stiff drink and downed it. Then he hurried into the living room and went to the door to make sure the latch had snapped and the door was locked.\n\nBack in the bedroom, it took him only a moment to go get a traveling bag from a shelf in a closet. He opened dresser drawers and grabbed a few articles of clothing, hurried into the bathroom for shaving and toilet articles, and tossed them into the bag.\n\nNow it was time to get the loot from its hiding place. He would have to work swiftly, he was thinking. Dusk would be coming in an hour, and he wanted to leave during the gathering night.\n\nHe returned to the bathroom. With a razor blade, he chipped around two of the tiles high in the wall, where the cement had been removed and soft putty substituted. He took out the tiles carefully and disclosed an aperture behind water pipes, and from this he took several packages of currency and the jewels he had removed from Mrs. Matilda Doring’s wall safe.\n\nWorking swiftly, he carried money and jewels into the bedroom and put the loot in the bottom of his bag beneath the clothing. He had no time to hide it better. To get away quickly was the thing now, before one of Fox Agnew’s boys faced him with automatic in hand.\n\nHe snapped the bag shut and started to turn toward the door of the living room.\n\n“Freeze!” a voice said, for the second time since he had entered the apartment.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nI Can Shoot\n\nDanny whirled, terror clutching at him again. It had been a woman’s voice. She was standing in the doorway, a well-dressed blonde whose age he guessed at about thirty. And the gun she held looked as formidable to Danny Blure as the one he had seen in the hand of the passkey thief.\n\n“Step right into the living room,” she ordered. “And remember I can shoot.”\n\nDanny gulped as he looked at her, obeyed as if the legs which carried him were not his own. He went into the living room and backed against the wall at her gestured order. “I’m glad to get out of that closet in your entry hall,” she told Danny. “It’s hot and stuffy in there.”\n\n“Who are you? What do you want here?” he asked.\n\nFear came to him again. This was it! Agnew had plenty of women in his mob, hard-hearted molls who knew how to shoot. Perhaps Fox had sent this woman; maybe she was the sweetheart of the man who owned the knife, and had asked to be sent so she could have her revenge.\n\n“Thanks for digging out all those jewels and that money for me,” she told Danny. “I was here when that passkey worker came, and had to hide in the closet. I saw him ransack the place and get nothing. I was only waiting for him to leave so I could get busy myself. Women are generally better searchers than men.”\n\n“You’re a passkey worker, too?”\n\n“Oh, no,” she replied. “The stuff you got from behind the tiles in the bathroom is what I hoped to find. I’m Magda Renton, a policewoman.”\n\n“A policewoman—you? You don’t look like a female cop to me,” Danny told her. “Let’s get right down to business talk, Gorgeous. Maybe we can make a deal of some sort. You interest me.”\n\n“You don’t interest me, except as a crook, and your well-known charm isn’t working today as far as I’m concerned,” she informed him. “Don’t make a move to get your gun where the passkey man tossed it into the corner! I didn’t have time to pick it up myself. Make a move toward it, and I’ll blast you down!”\n\nHer eyes were glittering now. “I was in the WAC during the war, and learned to shoot. If further information is needed, let me relate that I hold the women’s championship for the police pistol range.”\n\n“But…I don’t understand…” Danny gulped.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nThe Doring Affair\n\nShe spoke as if discussing an ordinary event of minor interest “Oh, it’s quite simple. The Doring affair, you know. The police have had eyes on you for some time; they learned that jewel robberies followed in your wake. They witnessed some of your contacts. We had everything we need except the loot from the Doring job, to pin this murder on you. Now we have that—thanks to you for digging it out for me.”\n\n“It’s a lie!” Danny stormed. “What’s your game? You’re no lady cop. If so, why’d they tend you here?”\n\n“A lady cop is a little more gentle when it comes to searching than a rough copper,” she explained. “I was to search your place, and if I found nothing, leave everything shipshape so you’d not suspect we’d been prying. In that case, we’d have kept on watching you. Sergeant Doyle is downstairs; he was to phone up and warn me if you came in. So you must have slipped in the back way—more evidence of guilt, though we’d not need it now. And that cheap passkey thief—I got a good look at him, and he’ll be picked up. I’ll get a pat on the back for this day’s work.”\n\nTerror had seized Danny Blure with a terrible grip this time. He could not reach his gun in the corner ; and he sensed she would surely shoot him if he made a hostile move. Terror of death was upon him—not from the muzzle of a gun held by one of Fox Agnew’s boys, but death in the electric chair.\n\nWatching him carefully, holding the gun ready for quick use made a move, she stepped to the phone and spoke below: “Please tell Sergeant Doyle to hurry up here. I’ve got Danny Blure and the loot from the Doring job.”\n\nSagging against the wall, all strength drained from him, watching her as she watched him with keen eyes, Danny waited.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  The Make-up Box\n  The Rings\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Make-up Box\n\nWith a rustling flirt of her skirts and a sharp upward, tilt to her chin, Mavis Pickering flounced out of the dressing room.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m done — through — finished,&quot; she announced with emphatic finality; and, in affirmation of her resolve, she took a firmer grip on the battered cash box that was tucked under her arm.\n\nThis box, the high sign of the profession, contained no loose change and bank notes, but a mixed, untidy collection of grease paints, rouge, powder, eyebrow pencils, lip salve, and other things required for the beautifying of a chorus girl. And if Mavis had not become angry at the stage manager and described him to his face as a sawed-off monkey, and if she had not grabbed her make-up box and left the theater in a rage and a hurry, there would have been no confusion, fuss, or happening out of the ordinary.\n\n&quot;Bye, Sammy,&quot; said Mavis as she passed through the narrow cubby-hole occupied by the stage doorkeeper. &quot;I&#39;m on my way.&quot;\n\nThe girl accompanied this farewell with a smile and a light laugh. Although her surface appearance of freedom from all cares and responsibilities endured until she had left the vicinity of the theater, Mavis soon found her anger cooling to an uncomfortable and chill sensation of fear. By the time she reached Thirty-Second Street, there was an expression of anxiety in her large gray eyes, and a pathetic droop to her undeniably pretty mouth.\n\nAssertion of independence sometimes carries with it a penalty, and, conscious that she had acted without forethought, Mavis entered a lunch room. She placed her make-up box on a chair and ordered coffee and pie, but the coffee grew lukewarm before she reached any decision regarding future means of providing herself with the cash necessary to pay for her room and board.\n\nShe had in her purse three dollars and ninety cents, and she wore on her fingers and wrists some glittering rings and bracelets. The jewelry, alas, was only nearly real. It looked all right, but the hardhearted Shylock who lives at the sign of the three balls is not taken in by a thin wash of gold on base metal. A pawnbroker has no use either for synthetic diamonds and rubies. He wants, and gets, full and adequate security for every cent he doles out.\n\n&quot;Yet,&quot; reflected Mavis, with tardy sorrow, &quot;to-day is Wednesday, and on Saturday I&#39;ll have to pay nine dollars for my room. I&#39;ve had my say-so, thrown up my job. Now—&quot;\n\nAt this distressing point the girl looked up and her wandering gaze met the eyes of a smirking, pimply complexioned youth seated at an adjacent table. He leered and showed a row of grinning fangs; then he favored Mavis with a repulsive appraising look of approval.\n\n&quot;Fresh beast he is,&quot; was the girl&#39;s mental comment. Launching a parting glare of disapproving, haughty contempt at the would-be masher, she paid for her pie and coffee and left the lunch room without her make-up box.\n\nHe of the poor complexion was in no wise perturbed by the girl&#39;s rejection of his wordless invitation to become acquainted, but when his sidelong glance assured him that she was indeed gone and out of sight, he stepped nimbly across the floor. His acquisition of the cash box was an easy matter, and he started for the door with an impudent swagger of proprietary right to Mavis&#39; make-up box. He started, but—\n\n&quot;Slick — but a low-down, yaller-dog, mean trick,&#39;&#39; said a voice. &quot;Thought nobody was watchin&#39; you gogglin&#39; at that girl, eh? Well, next time you try to pull off any mashin&#39; and sneak-thief tricks, make sure there ain&#39;t somebody around reading a newspaper with a hole in it. Which is it to be, a bash on that thing you call a nose, or a hand over of that box?&quot;\n\nSpotty-face backed away from this rough-spoken, interfering stranger, but before he did so he thrust out the cash box.\n\n&quot;I was going to run after her with it,&quot; he said, with quick cunning.\n\n&quot;And I&#39;ll save you the trouble,&quot; retorted the other. Grabbing the box, he left Spotty-face cursing in futile viciousness.\n\nWith commendable intentions, the new guardian of the girl&#39;s property started after her in haste, but before he had gone three blocks in the direction she had taken downtown, the unexpected developed and put a temporary check on the stranger&#39;s intentions. Mavis Pickering had pleased his sense of beauty, and the unsavory youth&#39;s behavior had roused his chivalry, but even for a pretty girl there are limits to what a man will do.\n\n&quot;Dashing Dick! Whadder you doing with that cash box?&quot;\n\nThese actual, challenging words were unheard by the stranger; but he saw a square-shouldered, hard-jawed man crossing the street. In that one glimpse, he read a determined &quot;purpose and a large query expressed in the man&#39;s keen and cold gray eyes. He saw that he was recognized and suspected of having committed a daring robbery.\n\nThere are some men who cannot show themselves without being given the &quot;double O,&quot; when spotted by a detective, and Dashing Dick had a past that rendered it an awkward matter to contemplate explaining his possession of that box. He didn&#39;t know what it contained, and didn&#39;t believe it held anything of value; but knowing that his tale of the manner and reason he had taken charge of the box would be scoffed at, Dick decided to let its fair owner wait, and look after his own skin.\n\nHe darted for the doorway of a nearby office building, and was fortunate enough to reach the elevator before the figure of the detective darkened the entrance. It was Dick&#39;s first intention to go up to the tenth or eleventh floor, traverse the long corridor that he knew ran the whole length of the building, and then descend by another elevator. But it was his habit to foresee the actions of others ere they were consummated, and before the elevator reached the third floor Dick did some quick thinking.\n\n&quot;Bradley is on my trail. Isn&#39;t it the most likely and probable thing that he will make a bee line for the other exit?&quot;\n\nWhile weighing this problematic point, Dashing Dick looked down at the box, and for one brief instant he thought of abandoning it and pursuing his way unhampered; but a sporting, stubborn streak urged him to take a chance. Besides, he wanted the opportunity to get a closer look at the girl&#39;s eyes. Were they blue or gray? She was tall, slender, graceful. She was — well, she was a girl decidedly worthwhile rendering a service to.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve got her coin-box, and I don&#39;t know her name or anything,&quot; thought Dick. &quot;Third floor,&quot; he snapped.\n\nDick caught a descending elevator almost at once. His hunch that the detective was watching the other exit proved a winner.\n\nAt the corner of the block Dick bought a newspaper, rolled it carelessly round the cash box, and chartered a taxi. He drove to a hotel and sought the seclusion of a room that he had hired for no other purpose but to open the box and see if he could find the name and address of the girl. The lock yielded to the persuasion of a little tool that Dick was an adept at manipulating, and he raised the battered lid.\n\n&quot;Grease paint! So, she&#39;s a stage girl! What&#39;s this?&quot;\n\nFrom a conglomerate mass of broken sticks of make-up, tubes, and rouge-stained powder puffs and hairpins, Dick disentangled a roll of crumpled paper.\n\n&quot;Heavy,&quot; he muttered as he shook it open, and stared in amazement at what fell out.\n\nOne by one he picked up a number of rings. He examined them with the eye of an expert.\n\n&quot;The genuine thing,&quot; he said, with a gasp. &quot;Seven of &#39;em. This beats all. Five thousand bucks&#39; worth of diamond and ruby rings. Gee, what a scoop that guy in the lunch room would have made! And what a chance I took when I butted in! Bradley would have nailed me for unlawful possession, an&#39; I&#39;d have gone up for pullin&#39; a stunt that I never knew I was onto. Seven beauts, hid away in a lot of female junk. That might have been a good looker, but I&#39;m sure the stuff she had on in the jewelry line was all phony. What&#39;s the answer?&quot;\n\nA host of questions to which he could find no answer buzzed in Dashing Dick&#39;s brain, and the more he considered his position, the less he liked it. Hitherto Dick had always planned his affairs. Accident, chance, and a reliance on good fortune had never played a part in his way of acquiring a living. Here, laying in the palm of his hand, was a small fortune. Were the rings the girl&#39;s property, or had she stolen them! Was that the reason for her worried air? Was the pimply-faced youth a confederate?\n\nQuestions without answers — a mystery without a key! Dick searched again for some clew to the girl&#39;s identity; then, finding nothing, he pocketed the rings, shut the box, and decided to spend the night in the hotel and let events take their course for awhile. He scented danger, but couldn&#39;t see where and how it was coming to him.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Rings\n\nFor half an hour following Mavis Pickering&#39;s abrupt departure from the theater, there was the usual period of bustle that follows the final drop of the matinee curtain. Then came an unrehearsed sensation. The star toe dancer came out of her private dressing room with a jump and a succession of shrieks of bereaved dismay. Hubbub and confusion ensued. There was a hasty search for the seven rings that the star asserted had been stolen and were valued at twenty thousand dollars. The management was faced with the loss of half a season&#39;s profits, and the police wert notified of the robbery.\n\nIn the subsequent inquiry that followed, the stage manager remembered that Mavis Pickering had quit before the last act. The inference was obvious, damning, Mavis had faked the quarrel for the purpose of getting at the star&#39;s property when all hands were on the stage. Mavis was the thief. A detective hurried hot-foot to her boarding house. Of course he didn&#39;t expect to find the girl there, but he might be able to pick up her tracks.\n\nThe detective found his first surprise when he met the placid, unruffled gaze of Mavis as she came into the sitting room. Apart from her attitude, the mere fact of the girl being there at all argued that she was either innocent or a mighty clever crook. On the basis of never believing a person innocent until they are proved not guilty, the detective cross-examined the girl respecting her movements since she had left the theater. From smiling, amused interest Mavis passed to a condition of outraged dignity.\n\n&quot;Evidently,&quot; she observed, following the detective&#39;s meticulous and searching catechism, &quot;you have made up your mind I have those rings. Why don&#39;t you arrest me, put on the bracelets, as you call them, and take me off to a cell? I&#39;m willing. Wrongful accusation will give me a good case for damages. I&#39;m out of a job, and a few thousand dollars will come in very handy to see me through the winter.&quot;\n\n&quot;I have made no accusation that you have taken the rings,&quot; said the detective, &quot;but if I may, I&#39;ll search your room.&quot;\n\n&quot;Go as far as you like. I&#39;ll wait here,&quot; said the girl.\n\nThe detective&#39;s search was nothing but a formality. He returned to the sitting room after a short absence. Then, however, he posed an awkward, pertinent question, and all of his suspicions returned with redoubled force.\n\n&quot;I did not see your make-up box,&quot; he remarked. &quot;You brought it from the theater.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where is it?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;\n\nMavis Pickering&#39;s statement was followed by a flush that the sleuth interpreted as evidence that she was concealing something. When she told him that she had left the box in the lunch room, and had gone back and failed to find it, the detective smiled meaningly.\n\n&quot;A good story,&quot; he remarked dryly. &quot;Who&#39;s your friend?&quot;\n\nTears of mortification trembled on the girl&#39;s lashes.\n\n&quot;I tell you,&quot; she protested, &quot;I didn&#39;t go near the star&#39;s dressing room. My make-up box was stolen, but there was nothing in it of any value.&quot;\n\n&quot;That may be,&quot; said the detective, &quot;but all the same I must ask you to come with me to the station. It is possible that we may have a photograph of the young man you mentioned. Even if we can&#39;t find the jewels, we can at least try to get your box back. There&#39;s no reason why a nice young lady like yourself should lose her make-up.&quot;\n\nThe man&#39;s words and tone were suave enough, but there was a nasty suggestion about his manner that he disbelieved her. Mavis bit her lip and surrendered to the compulsion of circumstance.\n\nWhen they reached the street, Mavis discovered that the robbery had already become a matter of public interest. She saw the headlines on the first news stand she passed. Under one pretext and another, Mavis was kept at the station for over two hours, and, during her stay, another and very thorough search of her room and an investigation of her antecedents were made. At the fag end of this fruitless inquiry, Detective Bradley came in. Although his story conflicted with the girl&#39;s description of the youth who had annoyed her, it substantiated the belief that she had been acting with a confederate.\n\n&quot;Depend upon it,&quot; declared Bradley, &quot;she passed that box on to Dashing Dick — though for the life of me I can&#39;t figure it out, him being such a dub as to carry it on the street with him. It beats me the fool slips some crooks will make. Get him, and we&#39;ll get the rings.&quot;\n\nIn this advance opinion, the detective overstepped the bounds of good prophecy. For three days they hunted high and low for Dashing Dick, and for the same period of time a close but unobtrusive watch was kept on Mavis. Then came another surprise that knocked the bottom out of the theory that Mavis was a thief. The real culprit confessed. It was the star&#39;s personal maid, and she had placed the rings in Mavis Pickering&#39;s box in case her mistress discovered her loss before she had a chance to leave the theater.\n\nNaturally enough the maid had not anticipated that Mavis would leave before the usual hour and carry off the hidden booty. Hence the miscarriage of her plans and the complications introduced by Spotty-face.\n\nOn the evening of the third day a reward of a thousand dollars was announced, and within half an hour of this inducement Mavis received a parcel by special messenger. She phoned the police immediately that her makeup box had been returned.\n\nThe rings were not in it.\n\nAt half past nine the same evening Dashing Dick showed himself at the stage door and demanded admittance.\n\n&quot;No &#39;phonin&#39; or yelpin&#39; for the cops,&quot; he warned the doorkeeper. &quot;Just you pass me along to the dame that put up the thousand simoleons for the recovery of her rings. I may know where they can be found, and if she comes across on the level there&#39;s a ten-spot in it for you. Do I go in?&quot;\n\nDick did, and when he gave over the rings, he held out the other hand for the money. When he returned to the doorkeeper&#39;s cubby-hole, there was present a cold-eyed individual.\n\n&quot;&#39;Low Brad,&quot; said Dick amiably. &#39;&quot;Have a smoke. No? Well, come an&#39; have a drink. I&#39;ll stand anythin&#39; you like from a soda to a quart of wine.&quot; Following his genial invitation, Dick pulled out his bulky wad of bank notes and flicked a ten across to Sammy the doorkeeper.\n\n&quot;Say,&quot; grunted Detective Bradley, &quot;how&#39;d you get hold of that box?&quot;\n\n&quot;Took it away from a low-down sneak thief,&quot; said Dick virtuously.\n\n&quot;And the rings?&quot;\n\n&quot;Rings?&quot; repeated Dick vaguely. &quot;Oh, I found &#39;em. Picked &#39;em up in the street. Bit of luck, eh? Well, s&#39;long, ole top.&quot;\n\nWith a regretful glance, Detective Bradley watched the going of the man that he had never been able to nail.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s over,&quot; he said, with a sigh. &quot;Dick&#39;ll have a high old time for a month or so an&#39; blow the lot in.&quot;\n\nAgain was the detective wide of the mark, for Mavis Pickering was visited that night by another special messenger and a load of financial worry dropped from her mind.\n\nThe thick envelope contained five hundred dollars and a short note. The bold, clear writing was expressive of Dashing Dick.\n\nI like your style. You&#39;re on the level. So am I — sometimes. Best of luck. — D. D.\n\n~ The End ~\n"

Chaddie&#39;s only stringing uth; &#39;fess up now, deah old boy, ithn&#39;t that tho?&quot;\n\nChadwick Wade, who was the eldest, by a half dozen years, of the quartet seated round the table, continued to smile. To all outward appearances, he was the same &quot;silly-ass&quot; sort of a young man as his fellows. He, too, wore a wrist watch. He carried his handkerchief up his sleeve, and his glossy, black hair was plastered down on his head without a part, as was theirs. And yet there was a difference in his aspect. Some hint of hidden strength of character, indefinable though it was, set him apart from the others.\n\nIt had been a bit irregular, the manner in which Chadwick Wade had turned up in the exclusive Crop and Stirrup Club. Exclusive, did we say? Oh, my word, the Crop and Stirrup was more than that! Who belonged to it, but such present-day Midases as J. D. Murchison, &quot;the czar of Wall Street;&quot; Campbell, the steel king; Stoneyman, the noted collector of facsimile engravings of the Presidents of the United States on five, ten, and twenty-dollar bills, and their ilk? Percy van Druyp, Algernon de Wetter, third, and Bertie Cole, were youthful interlopers, put up with merely out of regard for their sires, who had willed them, in accordance with the by-laws of the club, a life membership in that oldest and most ultra-exclusive of the city&#39;s social institutions.\n\nChadwick Wade had entered the Crop and Stirrup&#39;s sacrosanct precincts with a two weeks&#39; guest card, signed by James D. Donaldson, the railroad president, on the day after Mr. Donaldson had left for a protracted trip through the West.\n\nIt was conceded, at the outset, to be a shame that Mr. Donaldson was not there to take care of his guest. Afterward, when the members of the Crop and Stirrup Club, both young and old, had become better acquainted with Chadwick Wade, it amounted to little less than a club scandal that a young man of his attainments should have been left by the man who had put him up there to get along the best way he could. In addition to the fact that he told a story well, and played an excellent game of billiards and bridge, the unvarying good humor already referred to which he displayed toward all with whom he came in contact, had soon made young Wade the most popular frequenter of the club.\n\nNobody had objected, when the fortnight specified on his guest card was up, to his continuing to receive the hospitality of the Crop and Stir rip — least of all. J. D. Murchison, the club&#39;s governor, himself,\n\nChadwick Wade, by correcting a fault of &quot;englishing&quot; his ball on the wrong side, which the great man possessed. to the detriment of his billiard game by&#39; at least twenty points in a hundred, had made the grizzled head of the banking trust his stanch friend. He had ingratiated himself with others among the older members of the club, in various ways. But it was with the &quot;younger set,&quot; as represented by Percy van Druyp, et al, that the cheery Wade had see red his most emphatic hit.\n\nHe was a &#39;&#39;live wire,&quot; as Algernon de Wetter, third, hoarsely put it, who had seemingly been sent to them from heaven in answer to their prayer for something or some one to shatter the boredom which the aristocratic, and, hence, dully quiet, Crop and Stirrup Club held for them.\n\nWade had certainly waked up the three idle-rich young men by the statement he had made to them in the smoking room this evening, that, in his opinion, the majority of the modem buccaneers of Wall Street were easy marks.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s a fact,&quot; he had said. &quot;If I were a crook, and needed to shake down some one for the price of a trip to Palm Reach, or anything of the sort, I wouldn&#39;t lose a minute deciding who it would he. I&#39;d hunt up one of these captains of finance one reads of in the daily papers, and victimize hint to the tune of whatever I needed, as easily as turning over my hand. They&#39;re mostly all crooks, on a large scale, themselves; and, from time immemorial, the easiest kind of prey for one crook has always been another.&quot;\n\nAsked, incredulously, if he meant what he said. Chadwick Wade had smilingly replied in the affirmative, as the reader knows. Whereat, the storm of protest against the truth of the theory he advanced had arisen from the three other young gentlemen seated with him at the table.\n\n&quot;No, I&#39;m not &#39;stringin&#39; you, as you put it,&quot; Wade turned to answer Bertie Cole&#39;s question. &quot;And I mean exactly what I say. Men who make their living by outwitting other people. as our Murchisons and our Campbells and Stoneymans do, arc the easiest kind of picking for other confidence men&#39;s skin games. The records all go to prove it. How many gamblers did you ever hear of dying rich? All the recognized games of chance are in their favor. Yet, nearly all of them wind up broke. Where does the money they make go to, then? I&#39;ll tell you. The faro dealer gives it to the owner of the roulette wheel. He passes it over to the bookmaker at the race track. And he in turn loses it at stud poker. It&#39;s the same way with professional crooks. They all die poor. The money they make by one swindle, or series of swindles, they allow themselves to be duped out of — in some fake mining scheme, or by going up against the expert thimbleriggers on the stock market.&quot;\n\n&#39;&#39;But how about the Murchisons and the Campbells and the Stoneymans, that you&#39;re likening to these rotters?&quot; Percy van Druyp pointedly interjected. &quot;They don&#39;t die poor.&quot;\n\nChadwick Wade&#39;s smile broadened. &quot;That&#39;s because most of their lesser fellow confidence men are afraid to go after them.&quot; said he; &quot;because of the false reputation they&#39;ve built up for shrewdness in money matters. But that doesn&#39;t prove,&quot; he went on in the same smiling but positive tone, &quot;that they wouldn&#39;t make the biggest babies on earth, if a clever crook who understood his business once started to whipsaw one of them.&quot;\n\n&quot;By Jove, you&#39;d have a hard time proving that anything of the sort could be worked,&quot; murmured Algernon de Wetter, third, eagerly, &quot;with that one!&quot;\n\nThey all looked, Chadwick Wade included, across the smoking room, at the stern figure in its doorway upon which young De Wetter&#39;s eyes were fixed. It was J. D. Murchison, himself. Stepping, with the firm tread of the conqueror which he was, into the room, the man whose word was law to all who dwelt from nine to four each day in Wall Street and its immediate environs, selected one of the deep leather armchairs in which to deposit his commanding bulk, next a cigar from the case in his pocket, and then spread open his evening newspaper to give his attention to the stock columns.\n\n&quot;I&#39;d like to thee the man who could thwindle him!&quot; breathed Bertie Cole, in awed agreement with the other&#39;s statement concerning the master financier&#39;s invulnerability to the attack of any get-rich-quick schemer whatsoever. &quot;It&#39;th just one of thothe things that can&#39;t be done!&quot;\n\n&#39;&#39;A crook might as well try to break into the subtreasury with a toothpick,&quot; grimly commented Percy van Druyp, &quot;as to get into Murchison&#39;s pocketbook with any sort of a skin game under the sun!&quot;\n\n&quot;Let me see,&quot; said Chadwick Wade musingly. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve heard, somewhere, that J. D. Murchison first broke into the king row among the millionaires by cheating the widow of his partner out of her interest in the up-State bank he held fifty percent of the stock in. Is that true? And that, practically, every million he&#39;s added to his pile since, he got by some sort of sharp practice at the expense of his fellow men. Are those tales they tell of him also true? All right, then. That proves him to be a crook; and, according to my theory, credulous where the &#39;con&#39; game of another is concerned. As I can demonstrate.&quot;\n\n&quot;As you can do what?&quot; blurted out Algernon de Wetter, third.\n\n&quot;Now&#39;, look here, old man. You&#39;ve gone crumbly on the tea bun.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re talking abtholute rot, you know—&quot;\n\n&quot;Listen!&quot; Wade, no longer smiling, held up one hand for silence. &quot;Just for the fun of the thing. I&#39;ll tell you fellows what I&#39;ll do. I&#39;ll make a test, to show you that what I say is true. I&#39;ll wager that I, myself, can shake down Murchison for any amount in reason. Say, twenty-five thousand dollars.&quot;\n\n&quot;You couldn&#39;t do that in a million years!&quot; stated Percy van Druyp positively.\n\n&quot;I can do it,&quot; contradicted Chadwick Wade, with equal positiveness, &quot;inside of twenty-four hours. I&#39;ll not only take that amount of money away from him in that short space of time; but, to show&#39; you how easy I think it is, I&#39;ll further agree to do it by the oldest game you can think of. What do you say that is?&quot;\n\n&quot;The gold-brick thw&#39;indle!&quot; exclaimed Bertie Cole, his eyes shining with excitement over the prospect of a battle of wits between his new friend across the table from him, and the acknowledged leader of the crafty wolf pack in Wall Street, which the former had suggested. &quot;Thee if you can thell Murchison a gold brick, will you, Chaddie?&quot;\n\n&quot;There&#39;s an older game than that.&quot; Chadwick Wade, who was smiling again, shook his head. &quot;It&#39;s positively primitive in its directness — and I&#39;ll try that, if you like. I mean a hold-up. I&#39;ll go to J. D. Murchison&#39;s office tomorrow afternoon, and hold him up for twenty-five thousand dollars. And I&#39;ll get away with it, too.&quot;\n\n&quot;You mean,&quot; suggested Percy van Druyp, with his brow&#39;s drawn together in a frown over the unpleasant recollection he bore of the same thing&#39;s having happened to him in the past, &quot;that you&#39;ll hold him up with a plea to contribute that much to some charity you&#39;re interested in?&quot;\n\n&quot;No,&quot; the other, still smiling, continued to shake his head. &quot;I mean that I&#39;ll walk in and literally hold him up. At the point of a gun, with which I&#39;ll threaten to blow his head off if he doesn&#39;t come across with the sum I demand. That kind of a hold-up, my children!&quot;\n\nIn silence, the three young men, whose inherited wealth totaled between twenty and thirty millions, sat staring at him for a full minute.\n\n&quot;You have gone crazy!&quot; declared Percy van Druyp, with simple conviction, at length.\n\n&quot;I mean it!&quot; insisted Wade, leaning forward and smiling round at them. &quot;It you chaps will agree to help me, I&#39;ll show you that I intend to try the thing out by going over and arranging with Murchison for an interview tomorrow at his office — now.&quot;\n\nBefore they could rouse from the stunned amazement into which the daring of his contemplated project had thrown them, and so spring up to stop him, the trio of young clubmen saw Chadwick Wade rise from the table to cross the smoking room and address the great financier, who had just discarded his newspaper at the conclusion of the perusal of its financial page.\n\n&quot;Mr. Murchison,&quot; Wade was saying to the head of the banking trust, &quot;&#39;I&#39;d like to consult you about a small business matter. Could I drop into your office — say, to-morrow? Some time before three o&#39;clock would suit me best.&quot;\n\nMurchison, whose face had lighted up with pleasure at sight of the young man whose advice in regard to his billiard stroke had enabled him within the past week to defeat no less that) three of his friends, who had formerly been trouncing him with aggravating regularity, frowned as he heard his request for an interview at his office.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m a blunt man, Mr. Wade,&quot; the capitalist snapped, &quot;and so I&#39;ll tell you plainly that, if you&#39;re counting on the personal acquaintance you&#39;ve scraped with me in this club to get you an inside tip on the stock market, or a fancy-salaried position in some one of the banks I control, you&#39;re going to be disappointed, for I can do nothing for you.&quot;\n\n&quot;It hasn&#39;t anything to do with either of those things,&quot; Wade announced, his manner quite unruffled by the other&#39;s self-confessed bluntness of speech. &quot;You can take my word for that. But I prefer not to tell you beforehand what I want to come to see you about. You&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised when you find out — I can promise you that, also. How would two o&#39;clock to-morrow afternoon do? I won&#39;t detain you more than five minutes, at the most.&quot;\n\nMurchison silently regarded him from under his shaggy, iron-gray brow&#39;s, that were still skeptically lowered.\n\n&quot;All right,&quot; he growled at length, taking a morocco-bound engagement book from his vest pocket, and jotting down a line in it with his fountain pen. &quot;I&#39;ll see you then.&quot;\n\nChadwick Wade returned to his former companions at the table, beckoning to one of the club&#39;s faultless servants as he reseated himself.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m to see him in his office at two o&#39;clock to-morrow afternoon,&quot; he informed the three round-eyed and open- mouthed young men. &quot;We&#39;ll drink to the taking of the first step toward your education in the truth of my theory. By two-ten to-morrow afternoon, you&#39;ll have finally graduated — all of you will be ready to admit that I knew&#39; what I was talking about!&quot;\n\n&quot;But, dash it all, look here!&quot; expostulated Percy van Druyp. &quot;You can&#39;t mean to attempt to carry out anything so wild, so harebrained, so — so utterly preposterous, if you know what I mean! And if you do intend to go ahead with it, why, you can count me out, that&#39;s all! I&#39;m not lunatic enough to be a party to an attempted hold-up, carried out in broad daylight, and against one of the richest men in the country—&quot;\n\n&quot;Right-o!&quot; broke in Algernon de Wetter, third. &quot;I, too, refuse to have anything to do with it. That is — if you really mean to do what you&#39;ve threatened, Wade. But you don&#39;t, of course. You&#39;ve too much horse sense to attempt anything of the sort—&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going to prove my theory to you,&quot; Chadwick Wade slowly and emphatically interrupted, still smiling his quiet, confident smile, &quot;by holding up J. D. Murchison in his own office tomorrow afternoon for twenty-five thousand dollars — and I expect to get away with it, too, as I remarked before. That is, with your help.&quot;\n\nIt was Bertie Cole who spoke up, his eyes glowing with the fervor of a true sportsman.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll help you, Chaddie, old topper!&quot; he announced. &quot;I want to prove to you that you&#39;re wrong — juth as you thay you want to prove the contrary to uth. You&#39;ve offered to make the testh with Murchison, by holding him up. I won&#39;t let you back out now, before you&#39;ve proved to yourself that it can&#39;t be done. And tho I&#39;m willing to help you in any way you thay!&quot;\n\n&quot;Bertie, have you gone crazy, too?&quot;\n\n&quot;Do you want to disgrace yourself by getting arrested on a charge of attempted highway robbery, you idiot?&quot;\n\nSo, in shocked chorus, Percy van Druyp and Algernon de Wetter, third, cried out restrainingly to their friend, the rabbit-like formation of whose two large and prominently displayed front teeth was responsible for the impediment in his speech.\n\n&quot;He&#39;ll run no danger,&quot; Chadwick Wade reassured them gently. &quot;Anymore than either of you will in helping me. I promise you—&quot;\n\n&quot;But we&#39;re not going to help you!&quot; broke in van Druyp decisively.\n\n&quot;We certainly are not!&quot; no less firmly echoed the third of the line of De Wetters to bear the name of Algernon.\n\n&quot;Lithen, you chaps!&quot; urged Bertie Cole. &quot;You know he can&#39;t get away with thith, as he thays. Why don&#39;t you thee it the way I do, then? That it&#39;th up to uth to show him how bally wrong hith thilly old theory ith, by agreeing to help him. Ath long ath we don&#39;t run any danger ourthelves—&quot;\n\n&quot;You don&#39;t!&quot; Wade picked up the thread of his argument. &quot;I can assure you of that, to your own satisfaction, by telling you exactly how far away you&#39;ll be from the actual scene of the crime when it&#39;s carried out. You all know where Murchison&#39;s office is. On the eighteenth floor of the Murchison Building, at the corner of Wall and Broad Streets. Well, all you three have got to do is to stand on the sidewalk below. If I don&#39;t get away with my end of it in Murchison&#39;s office, you fellows should worry! I&#39;ll be the only one taken by the police. Nobody can possibly connect you with the affair, eighteen stories away from it at the time the game was sprung—&quot;\n\n&quot;But how do we help you, then?&quot; put in Percy van Druyp, with pardonable curiosity.\n\n&quot;By simply doing one thing, precisely at the moment I tell you to,&quot; Chadwick Wade promptly answered. &quot;If what I&#39;ve told you about how far removed you&#39;ll be from the scene of the crime is the truth, and if what I ask you to do isn&#39;t in any respect criminal — will you agree to do it?&quot;\n\nPercy van Druyp looked inquiringly at Algernon de Wetter, third.\n\n&quot;Shall we do as Bertie, here, suggests,&quot; he asked, &quot;and help him, in order to show him that he hasn&#39;t a chance in the wide, wide world of carrying this thing out?&#39;&#39;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s his funeral,&quot; Algernon agreed, with a shrug, after a moment&#39;s thought. &quot;If he wants to get himself arrested, and sent away to the observation ward of some hospital, as the very mildest thing that will happen to him as a result of trying on anything so wild as this, we should fret, as he suggests! As long as we don&#39;t run any risk ourselves of being connected in any way with the crazy stunt, that is.&quot;\n\nHe turned to Chadwick Wade. &quot;Tell us what it is you want us to do.&quot;\n\nWhereupon he told them.\n\nSlowly the expression of commiseration over the sudden fit of lunacy that had attacked him with which Percy van Druyp and Algernon de Wetter, third, if not Bertie Cole, had been regarding him, was replaced on their faces by a look of grudging admiration.\n\nIt was ridiculously simple, the thing he had asked them to do. And yet, its very simplicity, at first glance, made it appear that he might be able to carry out his project, after all. For that reason, two of the young men at least who sat with him at that table in the club&#39;s smoking room were on the point of disowning their promise to help him. They weren&#39;t actually going to join in a plan to rob one of their own set of twenty-five thousand dollars.\n\nBut, then, there came reassuringly to their minds the thought of the innumerable stumbling blocks that would still beset the path of the clever deviser of this scheme, even if it succeeded. to the accomplishment of the purpose he had boastfully set himself.\n\nWhy, no one could really hold up a man like Murchison, in the middle of the day in his office in the heart of the financial section, and walk off untouched with the money he had threatened out of him at the revolver&#39;s point. It was absurd!\n\nAnd so, gayly assuring him that they would follow the instructions he had given them to the letter on the morrow, but that he was going to fail, nevertheless, Percy van Druyp, Algernon de Wetter, third, and Bertie Cole, the three youngest members of the exclusive Crop and Stirrup Club, took their leave of Chadwick Wade.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Hold-Up\n\n&quot;Mr. Murchison. I want twenty-five thousand dollars!&quot;\n\nWade, the customary smile of good nature gone from his lips, which were pressed together in a firm line, sat beside J. D. Murchison&#39;s desk, in the latter&#39;s private office, at three minutes past two on the next afternoon.\n\nIn one hand, he held the back of the banker&#39;s chair, as he leaned earnestly toward him, while in the other was an automatic revolver of the latest make, the short, dull-black muzzle of which was pressed between the third and fourth buttons of Murchison&#39;s vest.\n\n&quot;At this moment, you are as far from being able to summon human help to get you out of the corner I&#39;ve backed you into, as you would be if you were alone with me on a desert island.&quot; the young man went on. in the same level, brisk undertone. &quot;Your private secretary, and the clerks in the office outside this door, might as well be a hundred miles away, instead of less than thirty feet, so far as any assistance they can be to you is concerned. If you lift your voice to summon them. I will kill you instantly. If you make a move toward one of the push buttons there under the edge of your desk, or that telephone, I&#39;ll shoot you before you can reach it — and, at this distance, I shall shoot straight. I mean exactly what I say.&quot;\n\nThe capitalist&#39;s face, which had been crossed by the impatient expression of one who believes he is listening to a lunatic at his caller&#39;s first words, was now ashen — with sheer panic fear — as he continued to look into the cold gray eyes of Chadwick Wade, which held his own as in a vise.\n\n&quot;I am a desperate man. Mr. Murchison,&quot; the young man went on. &#39;&#39;The statement which I have just made of my intention of killing you if you attempt to call for help, is no idle threat. I mean to shoot you dead, if you do not yield to my demand. Look at the matter from my standpoint — which, I am sure, would be yours, if our positions were reversed — and you will see that that must be so? If I fail to carry out this daylight robbery of you which I have attempted, you are powerful enough to have me sentenced to the State&#39;s penitentiary for twenty years. And probably sent back for twenty more on one trumped-up charge or another, out of sheer spite against me, after that, I have no desire to spend the rest of my life rotting in a prison cell. I&#39;d prefer to go to the electric chair and have it over with quickly, by killing you — if my plan falls through. But I know you&#39;re going to be sensible, and not let it. Hand over the twenty-five thousand.&quot;\n\nThe financier moistened his dry lips.\n\n&quot;But — but why do you make this demand of me?&quot; he stammered out. &quot;I have done nothing to deserve that you should come here to hold me up for such a sum in this way, have I?&quot;\n\nChadwick Wade smiled once more — a mocking smile, about which Murchison. searching his face with his wide, fear-filled eyes, could detect nothing of the young man&#39;s former good humor.\n\n&quot;You have, sir!&quot; he replied, with grim alacrity. &quot;This, let us say, comes under the head of just retribution. The biter bitten! How many of your fellow men have you held up, at the point of the weapon which your wealth and power has placed in your hands; in many cases, demanding all that they had, instead of this trivial fraction of your fortune, which I am asking of you? Don&#39;t go over the list — I haven&#39;t time to listen to the lengthy confession that would make. Come, Murchison! Don&#39;t play the injured-innocence role with me. You&#39;re getting no more than what&#39;s coming to you — exactly what you&#39;ve given to others — as everybody will say. If they don&#39;t, they ought to. You&#39;re a crook, caught by another&#39;s game. Don&#39;t do what the meanest trickster is above when he&#39;s been taken in by a fellow artist, which is to squeal — but pay up!&quot;\n\nWade pressed the pistol more firmly against the banker&#39;s vest.\n\n&quot;Give me twenty-five thousand dollars before I count five,&quot; he presented his ultimatum, &quot;or you&#39;re a dead man.&quot;\n\n&quot;I — I haven&#39;t got it!&quot; gasped Murchison. &quot;That amount upon me in cash, I mean. You — you know that must be the truth. No man carries such a sum—&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;ve got a check book, though, haven&#39;t you?&quot; sharply put in Chadwick Wade.\n\nThe financier stifled a gasp. He regarded the other with incredulity struggling against dawning hope in his eyes.\n\n&quot;Will you take a check?&quot; he asked quickly.\n\n&quot;Make it out to Chadwick Wade,&quot; the latter nodded, as Murchison, eagerly pulling out the drawer of the desk before him, produced his check book and hurriedly opened it. &quot;You&#39;re drawing it against your personal account in the bank downstairs, aren&#39;t you? That&#39;s right. Don&#39;t forget that the amount is twenty-five thousand.&quot;\n\nTaking the check which the hanker handed him across the room to the window, as though to assure himself in the stronger light there that it had been filled out and signed properly, Wade, with a nod of satisfaction, folded the pink slip of paper and placed it in his pocket — keeping the capitalist covered with the gun in his other hand meanwhile.\n\nDrawing out his handkerchief, Chadwick Wade airily flirted it open and touched it to his brow.\n\nThen, coming back from the window. he stood looking down at the financier beside his desk, with the pistol in his half-lowered hand trained unwaveringly upon the middle button of his vest.\n\n&quot;Now, I am about to leave you.&quot; the young man lightly informed him. &quot;Swing round in your chair to face the door. That&#39;s it. Now, as I back out, I can keep the most vulnerable part of your body directly under the muzzle of this gun, you see. I&#39;ll fire at the first move you make toward those push buttons before I&#39;ve passed through the door. After that, you may ring for your secretary whenever you please. Before he can cross the outer office to come in here. I&#39;ll have crossed it to the elevators in the hall — and be mingling with the crowd in the street below before you can start any one after me. Remember what I&#39;ve told you about playing your ball low and on the inside when you want to make a one-cushion draw shot, Mr. Murchison. If you must enter this in your personal- account book somehow, just set {he twenty-five thousand dollars down to instruction in billiards. And now, good-by, sir!&quot;\n\nThe door toward which he had been slowly backing across the room, while he talked, swiftly opened and closed. Chadwick Wade was gone.\n\nSpinning round in his chair, with a crafty chuckle. J. D. Murchison pushed one of the buttons under the edge of his desk to which the young man had referred, and reached for the telephone at the same time.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nCrisp, New Bills Of Large Denomination\n\nAs he closed the door of the financier&#39;s outer office behind him, to find that he stood alone for the moment in the elevator hall of the skyscraper&#39;s eighteenth floor. Chadwick Wade became galvanized into life.\n\nHe peeled off his overcoat, turning it inside out, and getting into it again. It&#39;s fur lining making it look like an automobile coat of that sort. As he ran toward the stairway, he removed his derby. He dropped it down the stair well. A motorist&#39;s cap with goggles attached, which he pulled out of his pocket and dapped on his head, finished the complete alteration in his outward appearance, which he had made in the few seconds that had elapsed since he had stepped out of the capitalist&#39;s suite of offices.\n\n&quot;Down, seventeen!&quot; he called, reaching the floor below just in time to see the red light above one of the elevator doors which indicated the approach of a descending car.\n\nOne minute and thirty seconds afterward, as though he had just stepped out of his motor car at the curb, Chadwick Wade was approaching the paving teller&#39;s window in the bank on the ground floor of the building, where J. D. Murchison kept his personal account — and where, for the purpose of being identified by its teller, the young man himself had opened a modest account of two hundred dollars three weeks earlier.\n\nAnd forty-five seconds later, with twenty-five thousand dollars in crisp, new bills of large denomination salted down in his pocket, he was walking away from the window — toward the open street door.\n\nMeanwhile, in his private office, eighteen floors above, an elderly man, with a face turned apoplectic in hue by the rage that consumed him, was alternately rattling the receiver of the telephone before him up and down, and bellowing into the mouthpiece.\n\n&quot;Give me that number, I say! Quick! Quick! This is J. D. Murchison talking. I&#39;ll have you discharged, girl, if you don&#39;t give me that number at once! Every second&#39;s delay brings me nearer to losing twenty-five thousand dollars! 90400 Broad! Get me that number, quick!&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Phone Call\n\nAt ten o&#39;clock that evening, a servant in the Crop and Stirrup Club informed Percy van Druyp that someone in Baltimore wished to talk with him over the long-distance phone. Excusing himself to his two companions, Algernon de Wetter, third, and Bertie Cole, in the smoking room, van Druyp departed in the servant&#39;s wake.\n\n&quot;Good evening, Percy, old dear!&quot; a faint voice came to his ear over the wire. &quot;Do you know who this is speaking? None other than your old chum, Chadwick Wade!&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, hello!&quot; exclaimed the heir to the van Druyp millions, in a tone in which relief and anxiety were mingled in equal parts. &quot;We&#39;ve been worrying all the afternoon, and most of this evening, over you. The thought never occurred to any of us before — but what are you going to do with Murchison&#39;s twenty-five thousand, now that you have succeeded in getting it?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going to Palm Beach with it,&quot; came back Chadwick Wade&#39;s response. &quot;I&#39;m on my way there now. I&#39;ll tell you something else that you and Algy and Bertie, your cute little playmates, never thought of, either. That &#39;Chadwick Wade&#39; might only have been one of the aliases of a clever crook. That happens to be the case, Percy. You ask James J. Donaldson when he comes back from his trip out West, and he&#39;ll tell you that the two weeks&#39; guest card I presented at your club is a forgery. Hello — you&#39;re still there, aren&#39;t you?\n\n&quot;That&#39;s all right, then. I didn&#39;t know but what the shock might have knocked the pins from under you. Yes, Percy, you and Algy and Bertie have been running about with a bold, bad thief, all this fortnight past. You&#39;ve been his accomplices in a crime, too — but don&#39;t let your consciences bother you about that. Murchison deserved to be shaken down. And, thanks to the three of you, I&#39;ve been able to do it quite satisfactorily — for enough to pay all my expenses for some time.\n\n&quot;You don&#39;t need to send detectives out to hunt for me,&quot; the speaker added, in conclusion. &quot;They&#39;d never recognize me from any description you could give them. For I don&#39;t really look a bit like the young man you&#39;ve known as &#39;Chadwick Wade&#39; for the past two weeks. How&#39;s that? Yes, I was in one of my many disguises. Now, I&#39;m going to say &#39;nighty-night&#39; to you, Percy — first thanking you and Algy and Bertie again for calling up the bank and keeping all three of the lines there busy, so that Murchison couldn&#39;t phone them to stop payment on the check, as soon as you saw me, through your opera glasses from the sidewalk below, wave my handkerchief in front of the window of his office. I hope, however, that the experience you&#39;ve gained will have repaid you for your trouble. That I was right — one crook, no matter how big he may be, can always be made a &#39;fall guv&#39; when another goes after him. Ta-ta!&quot;\n\n&quot;Central&quot; informed Percy van Druyp, in response to his frantic inquiry, that the party had rung off.\n\n~ The End ~\n\n"

Graham&#39;s the name of the people. New tenants.&quot;\n\nTen minutes after Hawke and Tommy had set out on this journey, the windscreen was caked with snow, except for the segment persistently kept clear by the windscreen wiper.\n\nTommy was able to see through this segment just sufficiently far ahead to make driving at a slow pace practicable. Hawke, by his side, could see nothing.\n\nSuddenly the youth muttered an exclamation and swung the wheel to his right. The car tilted and sank slightly, and the yellow haze which had been thrown back by the headlights was blotted out completely. The engine stopped.\n\n&quot;We&#39;d better scramble out, guv&#39;nor. Curse the old fool!&quot;\n\n&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; demanded the defective.\n\n&quot;I was referring to Father Christmas,&quot; said the youth. &quot;Didn&#39;t you see him?&quot;\n\nThey managed to force open the nearly side door sufficiently to enable them to squeeze through and scramble clear of the drift into which the car had been driven.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Hooded Figure\n\nWhen they reached the crown of the road where the snow was, perhaps, a foot deep, Hawke turned and stared questioningly at his young assistant.\n\nTommy gazed frowningly about him, vainly trying to penetrate the flickering curtain formed by the swirling shower of enormous snowflakes.\n\n&quot;Fellow with a beard,&#39;&#39; he said presently. &quot;Oldish kind of bloke. He had snow on his eyebrows and whiskers. Looked just like Father  —  dash it, guv&#39;nor, he was Father Christmas! He wore a hood!&quot;\n\n&quot;You nearly ran into someone dressed as a Father Christmas.&quot;\n\n&quot;He wasn&#39;t a foot away from the bonnet. He&#39;s bound to be around somewhere.&quot;\n\nHawke flashed on his pocket-torch, and the two searched the ground within a radius of several yards.\n\nNot only did they fail to find the gentleman who had caused them to run into the drift, but they even failed to find his footprints.\n\n&quot;The snow would have covered them,&quot; said Hawke, &quot;at the rate it&#39;s falling. Look, our own footprints arc almost filled in already.\n\n&quot;And we&#39;re beginning to look like a couple of snowmen. Hadn&#39;t we better make for that house the inspector spoke about? It can&#39;t be far away.&quot;\n\nAs they trudged through the snow, they speculated as to what could have become of the bearded man.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s strange!&quot; said Tommy. &quot;Must have been an optical illusion. Those mince pies I had at lunchtime, I mean — &quot;\n\n&quot;Is that a light over there, Tommy?&quot;\n\n&quot;Cheers, guv&#39;nor! Must be Peak View House.&quot;\n\nThey heard the whining of a dog as they forged up the drive, and when Hawke hammered on the front door of the two-winged, gabled house, the animal barked furiously.\n\nA man of medium height cautiously opened the door and peered out, holding a hurricane-lantern above his head.\n\nHe started when Hawke spoke.\n\n&quot;A — a breakdown!&quot;\n\nHis jumpiness and hesitancy of speech suggested that the man&#39;s nerves, for some reason, were on edge.\n\n&quot;Well, you must come in. Can&#39;t —  can&#39;t stay out on a night like this.&quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s very kind of you.&quot;\n\nHawke and Tommy stepped over the threshold, removed their coats and hats, and shook the snow out of them.\n\nSurveying his host in the light of the swinging oil-lamp in the hall, the detective saw that he was an amiable, probably rather slow-thinking individual with red cheeks, a Roman nose, and dark, thinning hair.\n\nThe detective presented his card.\n\n&quot;Oh — er — thank you — er — Mr. — er —  Hawke. My name&#39;s Graham — Harold Graham. Come in.&quot;\n\nHe pushed open a door and led the way into a long room illuminated by two bright, incandescent oil-lamps, and heated by a roaring coal fire which burned in a large, open grate.\n\nStanding immediately inside the doorway, her proximity to the door hinting that she had been listening at the keyhole, was a pale-faced young woman with anxious eyes and nervously twitching hands, who stared at the visitors in an oddly apprehensive manner.\n\n&quot;My wife,&quot; announced Mr. Graham. &quot;Mr. Hawke, my dear. Gentleman&#39;s car got in a snowdrift.&quot;\n\nThe man laughed nervously.\n\n&quot;Wondered who it could be,&quot; he went on. &quot;I was just saying to my wife — &#39;Supposing it&#39;s my Uncle Joe from Australia springing his surprise on us after all!&#39; I&#39;ve got a rich uncle in Australia, you see, and he&#39;s often written to say he&#39;d come back home and give us a surprise one of these line days. But then — ha-ha! — this isn&#39;t exactly one of the fine days, is it?&quot;\n\nHis nervousness acted like an accelerator on his tongue.\n\n&quot;You will stay the night?&quot; queried the woman.\n\n&quot;Of course they will, my dear,&quot; said her husband.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s very good of you,&quot; added Hawke tactfully.\n\nMrs. Graham&#39;s reaction was astonishing.\n\nShe breathed a heavy sigh, and, with clasped hands and drooping eyelids, said: &quot;Thank goodness!&quot;\n\n&quot;My wife&#39;s got a fit of the jumps,&quot; said Graham apologetically. &quot;You see, we haven&#39;t been in this place long. I sold my business on the other side of the county and came to open a shop in Moresby, which I&#39;m doing after Christmas. But it&#39;s a bit lonely here, you see — quiet, Peter. Drat the dog; what&#39;s the matter with him?&quot;\n\nThe mongrel, which had been sniffing round the visitors&#39; feet, had growled, then barked, and was now staring through the open doorway towards the front door, teeth bared, and hair bristling.\n\nMr. Graham glanced down at the card which the visitor had given him.\n\n&quot;I say,&quot; he said suddenly. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t be the Mr. Dixon Hawke, would you? Not the well-known detective, I mean!&quot;\n\n&quot;I expect I&#39;m the fellow you have in mind,&quot; answered Hawke. &quot;As a matter of fact, my assistant and I are looking for two men who are wanted for burglary in London. They&#39;re working this district. We have been expecting to be able to hand them over to the police at any moment. I suppose you haven&#39;t had anyone attempting to break into here, have you?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; said Mr. Graham, &quot;we&#39;ve had a knuckle of ham and half a roast chicken taken, and some bread — &quot;\n\nBut at this point Mrs. Graham broke in excitedly.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s like this, Mr. Hawke. As I said to Harold, I wouldn&#39;t stop in this house another night. Not after seeing that awful man, I wouldn&#39;t. He seemed to be wearing one of those Father Christmassy hats, you know, coming to a point at the top; there was snow all over his whiskers, and a kind of wild look in his eyes.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Face at the Window\n\nHawke was all attention now, and so was Tommy.\n\n&quot;When did you see this fellow?&quot; queried Hawke.\n\nMrs. Graham took a deep breath, and began again.\n\n&quot;The night before last,&quot; she said, &quot;soon after this snowstorm had started, we were sitting in here when we were startled out of our wits by an unearthly kind of howl from out the front, near that larch tree.\n\n&quot;I said to Harold: &#39;Go out and see what it is,&#39; but Harold, being a bit of a coward, just pretended he hadn&#39;t heard anything, and sat on here by the fire.\n\n&quot;About an hour later,&quot; went on the woman, &quot;the dog started these antics that you saw just now — whining and howling at the front door.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;d never known the dog do that before?&quot;\n\n&quot;Never!&quot; declared the woman emphatically.\n\n&quot;I stood over there by that window,&quot; continued Mrs. Graham, &quot;and I distinctly heard somebody groaning and moaning in a weird kind of way that almost froze my blood. Harold still pretended not to hear it, but I made him go out with the hurricane lamp, in case it was somebody hurt lying out there in the snow. He took the dog on the lead, but didn&#39;t find anyone. The dog growled and whined when it got near that large tree, but there was nobody there.&quot;\n\n&quot;Were there any footprints in the snow?&quot; queried Hawke.\n\n&quot;It was falling so thick and heavy,&quot; answered Mr. Graham, &quot;that my own footprints were covered up almost as soon as I made &#39;em. No, sir, I didn&#39;t find any footprints, and didn&#39;t see anybody lurking about. A bit queer it was, I moat admit.&quot;\n\n&quot;A bit queer!&quot; exclaimed his wife indignantly. &quot;It certainly was a bit queer, and I never got a wink of sleep that night. And then, again, last night we had the same scare all over again —  only worse this time. A bearded face with a hood over its head looked in the window.&quot;\n\nMr. Graham coughed in a half-apologetic manner.\n\n&quot;You know, my dear, there&#39;s such a thing as letting your imagination run away with you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Now, you saw it, too, Harold Graham,&quot; retorted his wife.\n\nHawke smiled at the bickering of the homely couple, but listened with interest to what they were saying.\n\n&quot;You saw the face,&quot; reiterated Mrs. Graham, &quot; and don&#39;t try to say it was your imagination, because you haven&#39;t got any imagination.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, it certainly did look like a face,&quot; admitted her spouse.\n\n&quot;And what&#39;s more, during the night —\n\nGraham interrupted her with another cough, and looked at Hawke in a way suggesting that he did not wish to be associated with his wife&#39;s irresponsible remarks.\n\n&quot;During the night, Mr. Hawke,&quot; continued Mrs. Graham, &quot;I heard somebody moving about in the snow, and I got out of bed and looked out of the window. There he was, a figure with a pointed hood on his head. He walked away towards that big ham of ours. It was a ghost, that&#39;s what it was. The place is haunted, and I&#39;m going to get out of it tomorrow.&quot;\n\n&quot;There aren&#39;t any such things as ghosts,&quot; protested Mr. Graham weakly.\n\n&quot;And that being so,&quot; put in Hawke briskly, &quot;we must find out what really is the cause of these disturbances.&quot; After partaking of a sumptuous meal, prepared by Mrs. Graham, Hawke put on his coat and hat. Tommy and Graham did likewise; then the three went out, Graham holding the dog on the lead and the detective and his assistant carrying hurricane-lanterns.\n\nThey went down the long drive as far as the entrance to the field in which the house was situated. Nothing happened until they had half-completed the return journey by another route, when the dog once more attracted notice towards itself.\n\nThe attention of the three searchers was arrested by a low growl, followed by a succession of yelps, which terminated in a melancholy and unmusical howl.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s that larch tree again,&quot; exclaimed Graham. &quot;There&#39;s something about it that scares him. Come on, Peter. Fetch it, boy!&quot;\n\nBut far from showing any inclination to &quot;fetch it,&quot; the dog tugged back, digging its paws in the snow when its master pulled on the lead.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nStumpy Green&#39;s Fate\n\nHawke pushed his way through the snow, and, holding his lantern above his head, peered up into the branches of the larch tree. The dog continued to howl.\n\n&quot;He isn&#39;t howling for nothing,&quot; declared Hawke, and proceeded to walk round to the other side of the tree.\n\nAfter taking about four paces, ho uttered a startled exclamation and went sprawling in the snow.\n\n&quot;What is it, guv&#39;nor?&quot; cried Tommy, rushing forward.\n\nHawke scrambled to his feet and scooped into the snow with his hands.\n\nThe light from the lanterns showed them a trouser-leg, and then a boot, and, in a short space of time, they had uncovered the body of a dead man.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll carry him into the boiler-room at the back of the house,&quot; said Graham. &quot;There&#39;s an old camp bedstead there.&quot;\n\nThe body having been carried into the stone-floored room, which was used as a wash-house, wood-store, and lumber-room, Hawke made a systematic examination, both of the body and the clothing.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s a slight contusion on the back of the skull,&quot; announced the detective, &quot;but death was due to exposure.&quot;\n\nHe stood up and stared frowningly at the petrified features.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s something familiar about the face!&quot;\n\n&quot;Stumpy Green, guv&#39;nor?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, my boy, I believe it is.&quot;\n\nA few moments later they had removed addressed envelopes from the dead man&#39;s pockets which established his identity as &quot;Charlie Green.&quot;\n\n&quot;He&#39;s one of the two we were after,&quot; Hawke explained to Graham. &quot;I was pretty certain they came along this way. The question that occurs to me now is — where&#39;s his confederate, Matson? Is he the chap who&#39;s wandering about looking like Father Christmas?&quot; Tommy shook his head.\n\n&quot;Matson&#39;s an undersized little weasel,&quot; he said. &quot;This Father Christmas chap&#39;s a big, burly bloke.&quot;\n\nHawke explained to the astonished Graham that his assistant had actually seen the figure which Mrs. Graham had taken for a Christmastide spectre.\n\n&quot;Then the missus hasn&#39;t been seeing things after all! It&#39;s true! We must tell her.&quot;\n\n&quot;The bearded man would appear to be a homicidal madman,&quot; remarked Hawke. &quot;Is that likely to help her to sleep better? I think it&#39;s preferable to let her believe in the ghost idea for the time being.&quot;\n\nOn thinking the matter over, Graham agreed with this.\n\nFor Mrs. Graham&#39;s benefit, Hawke was presently advancing the theory that the dead man had been about to call at the house, or, perhaps, to burgle it, when he fell, stunned himself, and was subsequently suffocated beneath the snow.\n\nAbout an hour after the four had retired for the night, Hawke heard a faint commotion in the bedroom next to that which had been assigned to him, and then he was aroused by the excited Graham, who knocked furiously on his door.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s there, Mr. Hawke! Outside in the field. Look through your window,&quot; said Graham, hurrying into the detective&#39;s room holding an overcoat over his pyjama-clad shoulders.\n\nHawke looked out, and was able to see the bearded man with the hood. The snow had ceased falling, and the white landscape was faintly illuminated by a hazy moon.\n\nThe man was walking across the field with unsteady gait, and apparently without any definite goal in view.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nWelcome, Uncle Joe!\n\nLook at him,&quot; gasped Graham. &quot;He&#39;s a madman, all right. What shall we do?&quot;\n\nHawke was busy dressing.\n\n&quot;You — you&#39;re not going out after him, are you?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t relish being done to death in bed during the night!&quot;\n\nHawke strode out of the bedroom and roused Tommy.\n\nThe three presently went downstairs, followed by Mrs. Graham, who seemed much more courageous about the business than her husband.\n\n&quot;You and Tommy go out the back way,&quot; Hawke instructed Graham, &quot;and I&#39;ll go out the front. We&#39;ll try to surround him.&quot;\n\nA few moments later Hawke was making his way swiftly over the snow.\n\nHe had proceeded about a hundred yards when there were shouts to his right.\n\n&quot;Coming your way, guv&#39;nor,&quot; came Tommy&#39;s voice, and then the detective found himself confronted by a wild-eyed figure with the characteristics of the traditional Santa Claus minus the latter&#39;s benevolence.\n\nThe stranger was a big man, weighing probably sixteen stone, and he attacked the detective desperately.\n\nHawke took a painful blow on the side of the head, and ducked in time to avoid a second. The two closed and went rolling over in the deep snow.\n\nThe fortunes of the battle went against Hawke, who found himself gulping in mouthfuls of snow as the big man pushed his head down deeper and deeper into it.\n\nHe struggled with every ounce of his strength to get free, and suddenly the weight on him eased.\n\nStruggling up, gasping and dragging off the mask of snow which clung to his face, the detective saw Tommy and Graham struggling with the bearded man, and he again plunged into the fray.\n\nThe fight, which was one of the toughest the two Londoners had ever been in, lasted about three minutes, and then Hawke managed to land a smashing uppercut, which sent the big man to earth in a limp heap.\n\nOn Hawke&#39;s instructions Graham hurried indoors and fetched a clothes-rope, and when the bearded man came to he was securely bound hand and foot.\n\n&quot;Where am I?&quot; he moaned, and blinked up at Graham, who was now holding a hurricane-lantern.\n\n&quot;Harold!&quot; exclaimed the man.\n\nGraham looked bewildered.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t you know me! It&#39;s my beard, likely. I&#39;m Joe Graham. Your Uncle Joe, from Australia.&quot;\n\nHawke put a number of questions to the man, and realised that he had been a victim of concussion, with resultant loss of memory. He had no recollection of the struggle which had just ensued.\n\n&quot;Yes, it&#39;s Uncle Joe all right,&quot; said the amazed Graham; and, a few minutes later, the man was being assisted indoors, Tommy bringing up the rear carrying the sack which Uncle Joe had been wearing as a head covering, after the style of a coal-heaver.\n\nWithin the living room, presently, the visitor, who was bruised and exhausted, was given brandy.\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t understand it,&quot; he said, when he was told what had just happened. &quot;You say I&#39;ve been wandering about outside for two days and nights? All I can remember is that I got off the bus at Moresby and walked up here, and when I was getting near the house I saw a couple of suspicious-looking chaps prowling about. After that — dashed if I know! There&#39;s a sort of a blank, and then I found myself sitting on the ground tied up, with you holding the lantern and looking down at me.&quot;\n\n&quot;That would be when you heard that shout, Mrs. Graham,&quot; nodded Hawke. &quot;Your uncle accosted those two fellows, Green and Matson, and there was a struggle in which Green and your uncle were laid out. Only your uncle recovered, but memory was thrown temporarily out of gear. It&#39;s happened to a good many people. I expect we shall hear more about it when Matson&#39;s picked up.&quot;\n\n***\n\nNext morning the party searched the grounds, and found Uncle Joe&#39;s hat, which had evidently been knocked off in the course of his struggle with the crooks; and in a corner of one of the barns they found some scraps of food which the Grahams&#39; unfortunate relative had stolen from his nephew&#39;s pantry during the period when his mind was blank.\n\nIt was Christmas Day, and the body of Green having been removed to Moresby mortuary, Hawke and Tommy accepted the Grahams&#39; pressing invitation to stay for the festivities.\n\n&quot;Matson&#39;s having his dinner in Wicklow Police Station,&quot; announced Hawke on returning from Moresby. &quot;The inspector&#39;s been on the phone to them over there. According to Matson&#39;s story, Uncle Joe, you and Green coshed one another simultaneously. Matson ran off along the road.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; ruminated the big Colonial. &quot;I said I&#39;d give you a surprise?&quot;\n\n&quot;And in my last letter,&quot; replied Graham, &quot;I told you that you&#39;d get a welcome you&#39;d remember all your life. Now then, my dear,&quot; he added, turning to his wife, &quot;let&#39;s give the turkey a shaking-up.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n\n"

Then, his heart beating like a trip hammer, he mustered up courage enough to push open the swinging doors and peep into the gloomy interior.\n\nHe was frightened — scared to the point of hysteria. Yet for thirty years he had stopped in that selfsame place in the hallway morning and noon on his way to work. For thirty years, fifty-two weeks in the year, six days a week and twice each day had he sought his number on the time clock and pushed the button, which registered his comings and his departures. Instinctively — for figures were one of his hobbies — he made the calculation in his head: Eighteen thousand, seven hundred and twenty times had he pushed his way through those doors.\n\nAnd never before — except possibly the first time when he had applied for a place with the firm — had he been as frightened as he was now.\n\nFor this was the first time he had ever come to rob!\n\nGetting a grip on himself, he entered the big office on tiptoe — an office covering nearly one-fourth of a city block —  yet he knew that old Bill Judkins, the watchman, would be making his rounds out in the factory at that particular hour. It was a part of his daily work to check up the dial on the night watchman&#39;s clock; he knew that the old man traveled as true to schedule as a mail train.\n\nHe halted just inside the doors and listened, his eyes taking in every one of the familiar details. From where he stood he could discern the dark shapes of row after row of desks, each identical in size and finish with its mates. Around two sides of the big room were innumerable cubby holes of offices divided from each other by ground glass partitions extending two-thirds of the way to the ceiling. During working hours they housed the elite of the office world — the men and women who had pushed their heads above those of their fellows.\n\nHis own desk was second from the front in the second row from the right just inside the cashier&#39;s cage — a huge affair of wire netting and glass. It gave him renewed courage for the task ahead as he gazed upon its outlines staring at him out of the darkness. For twenty-seven years — since the day of his promotion from the office boy ranks — he had occupied that desk, or one like it, in Carney &amp;amp; Kirk&#39;s office, giving to Carney &amp;amp; Kirk the best of his manhood for starvation wages and two weeks&#39; vacation yearly on pay. Others had gone over his head — scores of them — men no better fitted than he — young cubs with &quot;pull&quot; or a college education. He had long since given up hopes of promotion. He had reached the point where he was a mere cog in the machine — a fizzle and a failure.\n\nIn ninety-nine cases out of every hundred when a man goes wrong a woman is responsible. In Amos Duncan&#39;s case the woman was — Mrs. Amos Duncan!\n\nA downtrodden cog in an office machine — a man with little force of character in the beginning — henpecked at home and abroad, Duncan held to the firm opinion that his wife had conferred a favor upon him by marrying him. The fact that he had rescued her from a life of drudgery in the shipping room of the factory changed his opinion not one iota. Nor did Mrs. Duncan fail to keep his memory refreshed whenever opportunity offered itself.\n\nAmos Duncan longed to appear as a hero in the eyes of his wife. It had taken him two years to screw up his courage to the point of robbing Carney &amp;amp; Kirk. Yet he had planned the affair so often that he knew he would be absolutely above suspicion. And with the money once in his hands, he could hide it until all memory of the affair had blown over and then, with a carefully concocted story of a lucky speculation on &#39;Change, resign and migrate to some distant city to spend his declining years in ease with the lady who had assumed his name.\n\nCarney &amp;amp; Kirk always paid off in cash. Duncan knew that there was close to fifty thousand dollars in the vault ready to go into the pay envelopes in the morning. As assistant cashier and one of the old timers with the firm he had been entrusted with the combination. He had read that skilled burglars are able to open vaults by listening to the whirl of the mechanism. A rag saturated with alcohol would do away with telltale finger prints. The police would think the robbery the work of a professional.\n\nStill walking on his toes, he worked his way through the maze of desks to the big vault in the rear of the office behind the cashier&#39;s cage. Taking a tiny flashlight from his pocket, he pressed the button and allowed the stream of light to play over the dial, while he manipulated the affair with fingers that trembled as from the ague. It refused to work. … In his nervousness he had gone past the number. He took a deep breath and with the sweat standing out in great beads upon his face, attacked the job again …\n\nSomeone was entering the office through one of the rear doors leading from the factory!\n\nHe stopped for a second. Then, as he heard the footsteps coming toward him in the darkness, he leaped outside the cage and drew his revolver. He had never fired a gun in his life. He had bought this one — a cheap, second-hand affair — merely as a matter of precaution and because he knew that burglars always carried such weapons.\n\nFrom out of the darkness came a flash! A report! A bullet sped past his head and flattened itself against the vault door! It must be that Judkins, the faithful, had heard something suspicious and had entered. He longed to call out to the watchman his name … he realization of his mission in the office at that time of the night stopped him. Involuntarily, he gave a little squeak of fear. A second bullet passed unpleasantly near.\n\nInstinctively — just as a cornered rat will fight — so his finger pressed the trigger of his own gun. He fired aimlessly in the general direction of the other, dodging from desk to desk, knocking over chairs … he was in a panic of fear.\n\nThe other&#39;s fire ceased suddenly. From out of the darkness across the great room came a dull, throaty cry. Something metallic jangled against the tiled floor. An instant later it was followed by a heavier body — a body that crashed against a desk as it dropped.\n\nDuncan leaped through the folding doors and out into the hallway again. To unlock the outer door and dash out onto the sidewalk was but the work of an instant … around the corner he heard the shrill whistle of the policeman on the beat as, attracted by the shots, he came lumbering along signaling for his mate.\n\nHe dodged into the shadow and turned into the alley. Behind him he could hear the policeman hammering on the office door with his night stick. From two blocks down street came the sound of another whistle. In the distance a third shrilled, proving that reinforcements were on the way.\n\nMrs. Duncan was sleeping soundly when he arrived home after a roundabout trip through alleys and side streets. Letting himself into the house with his pass key, he hastily sought the security of his own room.\n\nSo far as he knew no one had seen him either going to the factory nor leaving it. But, God! What a fizzle he had made of the affair. And there was blood on his hands — the blood of poor old Judkins. What had he gained? Nothing — absolutely nothing.\n\nHe paced the floor, every nerve tingling. He wondered … poor old Judkins … and he had a crippled wife, too … with Judkins gone she would have to go to the poorhouse … it was something that he had not foreseen.\n\nHe was still pacing the floor when the sun came up in the east. In the other room he heard Mrs. Duncan getting up. In less than two hours he would have to go to the office. Of course, no one would suspect him, but —\n\nHe could hear Mrs. Duncan rattling the pots and pans in the kitchen when the door bell rang. He opened the bedroom door a crack and peeped through as she answered the summons. A gruff voice was asking for him. He heard her admit the visitors — there seemed to be two of them — then she called shrilly up the stairway for him.\n\nHe knew that they were detectives from their heavy tread. They were after him for killing Judkins. His brain was in a whirl. Yet he wondered how it happened that they associated him with the crime. He had been so careful, too. Probably he had dropped something in his mad rush to the outer door.\n\nHe could never face the music … and Mrs. Duncan! What would she say? He couldn&#39;t tell her that he had gone to the office to rob the vault for her sake and had made a failure … the gun lay in the bureau drawer where he had tossed it. He picked it up and broke it open. The chambers were all empty. He had used every cartridge in killing poor old Judkins.\n\nFrom downstairs came a buzz of conversation. Mrs. Duncan shrieked … he heard his own name mentioned … God! They had told her what he had done! He must move rapidly.\n\nHis glance fell upon a bottle of carbolic acid … Mrs. Duncan was at the bottom of the stairway now, shrieking his name … he placed the bottle to his mouth and emptied it at a gulp! With the fiery liquid eating into his vitals — his throat afire — he reeled across the room and tumbled in a heap upon the bed.\n\nOutside, Mrs. Duncan was pounding at his door.\n\n&quot;Amos! Wake up!&quot; she was shouting between sobs — for Mrs. Duncan was a hysterical woman — &quot;an awful thing&#39;s happened. There are two detectives here. Old man Judkins went home sick from the factory last night and while he was gone somebody broke into the office! The robbers had a fight &#39;cause one of them was found dead when the police broke in after hearing the shots!\n\n&quot;Enright, the cashier, is out of town and they want you to come down and open the vault and see if anything is gone. Oh, isn&#39;t it awful?\n\n&quot;Amos, why don&#39;t you answer?&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\n\n"

Leave it to me, and I&#39;ll do my best to help you both.&quot;\n\nHawke ushered his visitor to the door, and gave her a reassuring handshake as he bade her good-bye.\n\n&quot;I say, sir,&quot; exclaimed Tommy Burke when they were alone again, &quot;it looks mighty black against young Hardy, don&#39;t it? According to his own story, he hears a cry for help, and finds the door locked. When he &#39;phones for the police, and they get in, they find a man with his head bashed in, Hardy&#39;s cap on the floor under the table, and his finger-prints on the weapon. Sounds a mighty thin tale, and I don&#39;t wonder they pinched him so quick.&quot;\n\n&quot;Certainly the circumstantial evidence is all against the lad,&quot; agreed Hawke, &quot;but his finger-prints may have got on the stick in half-a-dozen different ways. That remains to be seen.&quot;\n\nThe detective pulled out his watch.\n\n&quot;Ten o&#39;clock,&quot; he announced. &quot;The crime was committed at six or six-fifteen, and Hardy arrested an hour ago. His mother rushed right around here as soon as she knew the police had taken him. Quick work all the way. Well, lad, we&#39;ll slip along to Clare Street and see Forbes.&quot;\n\nThe pair left Dover Street and walked rapidly down to Clare Street Police Station, where they found Inspector Forbes still on duty. He was an old acquaintance of Dixon Hawke, and he shook his head when the detective explained his mission.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re on a dud thing, Hawke,&quot; he said. &quot;The evidence is plain enough to convince the most bone-headed jury alive. That young ruffian did the job, and he&#39;ll swing for it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Looks black,&quot; Hawke agreed, &quot;but I&#39;d like to see the body, and have a talk with the lad, if I may.&quot;\n\nThe inspector considered the request for a minute before he answered.\n\n&quot;All right, Hawke. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m acting right in letting you do it, but I&#39;ll take the risk.\n\n&quot;The murdered man is Ezra Walker, of Walker &amp;amp; Goldman, the diamond assessors, of Shaftesbury Avenue. He was knocked out with a loaded cane, but up to the moment we don&#39;t know if anything was stolen. His partner seems to be out of town. Come on, then; the body is in the mortuary.&quot;\n\nDixon Hawke and Tommy Burke followed the inspector through the office and across the yard to the mortuary, where Forbes drew back the sheet covering the dead man.\n\nTommy came nearer as his chief began to make a rapid examination, and it was not long before he knew that the detective had noted points of more than usual interest.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Incredulous Policeman\n\nWhen Hawke finally completed his examination there was a curious gleam in his grey eyes which Tommy did not miss.\n\n&quot;Finished?&quot; asked Forbes. &quot;Like to see the weapon?&quot;\n\nHawke nodded, and they went back to the office, where the inspector produced a heavy cane carefully clamped in a stand to preserve the fingerprints upon it.\n\nPulling on his gloves, Hawke subjected the cane to a long and detailed examination through his powerful pocket magnifying-lens. Presently he straightened up.\n\n&quot;Welt, Forbes,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;whatever killed Ezra Walker, it was not this cane.&quot;\n\n&quot;What!&quot; exploded the inspector incredulously. &quot;Look at the blood, and then again there&#39;s Hardy&#39;s fingerprints on it, as plain as daylight!&quot;\n\n&quot;All the same,&quot; answered Hawke, &quot;this was not the weapon. There is blood on it, as you say. There is too much and too little blood.&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you mean?&quot; demanded Forbes irritably.\n\n&quot;Just this. There is blood smeared thickly along some four inches of the cane, but there is not a particle on the undersides of the joints of the cane.\n\n&quot;If the cane had struck the blows, and only two were struck, the blood would be in two distinct patches or in one not more than an inch and a half or two inches at the outside. The force of the blow&#39;s would have squashed the blood into every crevice of the cane, yet we find here that this is not so.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, what about that?&quot; demanded the puzzled inspector.\n\n&quot;Seems clear enough to me,&quot; broke in Tommy Burke. &quot;The cane was rubbed on the dead man&#39;s head after his skull had been cracked open with some other weapon. That&#39;s why none of the blood got into the joints; it was only smeared on the outside curve.&quot;\n\n&quot;Quite, Tommy,&quot; nodded Hawke. &quot;And what is more, there are no signs of anything but blood; some fragments of skin or hair should also be adhering.\n\n&quot;In addition, the weapon which struck down Ezra Walker was a very heavy, short-handled, blunt-edged instrument — at a guess, I&#39;d say a big spanner; and it was used by a left-handed man, not above average height. The position of the wounds show that.&quot;\n\n&quot;And he had pink eyes and blue teeth!&quot; said Forbes sarcastically.\n\n&quot;Perhaps he did,&quot; Hawke grinned. &quot;Now, I&#39;d like to have a word with the prisoner.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Stranger in the Lift\n\nThey found Jim Hardy sitting on the hard bed looking the picture of misery, but when Hawke introduced himself he brightened up at once.\n\n&quot;Tell me your story as briefly as possible, but don&#39;t leave out the smallest detail, however unimportant it may seem to you,&quot; said Hawke. Hardy leaned against the wall.\n\n&quot;Then, Mr. Hawke, it&#39;s like this. I&#39;m the lift-attendant at the Shaftesbury Avenue building in which Walker &amp;amp; Goldman have an office on the top floor.\n\n&quot;I finish at 6.30, and the lift is locked up until I come on duty again at eight next morning. Tonight I took a gentleman up about 6.5, or perhaps 6.10, to the fourth floor, and went up to the top floor after I&#39;d seen him out.\n\n&quot;When I got there the cleaner, Mr. Harris, asked me to nip down and get an evening paper. I went down in the lift and got it from the boy who sells them just outside the building. Back on the top floor, the cleaner had started on the offices at the other end of the corridor, so I went along and gave him the paper.\n\n&quot;As I came back and was passing Walker &amp;amp; Goldman&#39;s, I heard a sort of thud, and then a cry of &#39;Help!&#39; half-strangled and not very loud. I immediately seized the handle, but the door was locked, and, though I hammered on the door for a minute or two, I got no answer. I knew that Mr. Walker was still there, and I got the wind up about him.\n\n&quot;I rushed into the room Harris was cleaning and told him what I&#39;d heard, but as he&#39;s a bit deaf and the cry was low, he had not heard a thing. We decided to &#39;phone for the police, and when they came and went in through Mr. Goldman&#39;s office, which has a separate door from the main office, they found Mr. Walker dead.&quot;\n\nJim Hardy paused, and Hawke asked a question.\n\n&quot;Why did you not think of going in through the other door yourself?&quot;\n\n&quot;Because it was locked, sir. I tried it, as Harris can prove.&quot;\n\nHawke frowned.\n\n&quot;And yet the police found it open only a few minutes after,&quot; he remarked. &quot;Very strange, Hardy. How do you account for it?&quot;\n\nHardy shook his head in despair.\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t, sir,&quot; he replied. &quot;Same as I can&#39;t account for my hat being in the room, and my finger-prints being on the stick.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where do you keep your hat when you are on duty?&quot;\n\n&quot;In the little cupboard at the end of the top-floor corridor, sir.&quot;\n\nHawke fingered his long chin as he stared thoughtfully at the ceiling.\n\n&quot;Who was this man you took up about five minutes past six?&quot; he demanded presently. &quot;Did you know him?&quot;\n\n&quot;No, sir; never set eyes on him before. He was a thick-set gentleman, not so tall as me, with a heavy black beard and dark glasses. He wanted the Premier Insurance Company, and when I told him that they closed at sharp six, he said they were expecting him.&quot;\n\n&quot;H&#39;m! What sort of a stick was he carrying?&quot; Dixon Hawke shot the question at Hardy like a pistol crack, and the young man blinked as if he had been struck. But suddenly a light of understanding dawned in his eyes.\n\n&quot;By Jove, sir, I remember now! It was a cane, and what&#39;s more, he dropped it on the lift floor, and I picked it up for him.&quot;\n\nInspector Forbes sniffed, and Dixon Hawke smiled.\n\n&quot;Well, that&#39;s about all, Hardy. Cheer up, lad,&quot; he said kindly. &quot;Things are not as black as they seem.&quot;\n\nHe clapped the young lift-attendant encouragingly on the shoulder as he rose to leave the cell with the others; and Jim Hardy&#39;s smile was quite spontaneous as he replied:\n\n&quot;Thank you, sir. I feel a lot better now that I know you&#39;ve got the case in hand.&quot;\n\n&quot;Do you really believe that yarn, Hawke?&quot; asked Forbes, when they were back in the inspector&#39;s room. &quot;Black beard and dark glasses, and picking up the stick — which last little bit accounts for that young blackguard&#39;s prints being on it. Bah! Hawke, it&#39;s a chunk of fiction he&#39;s invented while cooling his heels in the cell.&quot;\n\n&quot;Truth is sometimes more difficult to believe than fiction,&quot; retorted the detective. I&#39;ll admit it sounds fishy, but it remains to be proved. In the meantime I&#39;d like to view the scene of the crime.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re wasting your time, Hawke,&quot; said Forbes, &quot;but if you like doing it, I ain&#39;t going to stop you. Hang on a minute and I&#39;ll give you a permit.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nCupboard Clues\n\nWith the police inspector&#39;s note in his pocket, Dixon Hawke set out for Shaftesbury Avenue.\n\nThe constable on duty admitted them to Walker&#39;s office, and watched with interest as Hawke commenced operations.\n\nHawke stood in the middle of the room and subjected the place to a swift survey; then he walked over to the desk at which Ezra Walker had been sitting when he was struck down.\n\nOn a blotting-pad in front of the armchair lay a half-finished letter, and Hawke leaned over and examined it.\n\n&quot;What do you make of that, Tommy?&quot; he asked, indicating the sheet of paper.\n\nTommy scrutinised it.\n\n&quot;An ordinary business letter, half-finished, sir,&quot; he replied. &quot;Walker must have looked up at his murderer, or else the last word would have been wonky. It&#39;s neatly written, like the others, so he could not have been writing it when he was coshed.&quot;\n\nHawke nodded approvingly.\n\n&quot;Well reasoned out, Tommy!&quot; he said. &quot;And it proves that whoever did it was well known to Walker, and a frequent visitor to this room. If he had been a stranger, it is extremely unlikely that Walker would have sat here quietly writing while the other walked right up to him and struck him down. No, lad, we must look for the murderer in a person perfectly at home in this office.&quot;\n\nTommy frowned.\n\n&quot;That don&#39;t make it any better for Jim Hardy,&quot; he remarked. &quot;Walker would have known him well enough.&quot;\n\nDixon Hawke did not reply, but turned away from the desk and glanced about the room. His eyes alighted on a big cupboard near the fireplace, and he crossed over to it.\n\nTommy watched him as he opened the door, and a moment later he saw his chief pick something off the wood. It was a short, black hair, which had become caught in a tiny splinter. Hawke gave a little exclamation of satisfaction as he placed the hair in an envelope and put it into his wallet. Then, bending down, he examined the floor.\n\nThe cupboard did not appear to have ever been used, and the dust was thick. Tommy noticed obvious footmarks, but so ploughed about as to be useless for identification purposes. Only one thing Hawke troubled about, and that was a small lump of mud which he found just inside the door.\n\nThis he carefully picked up and laid on a sheet of paper. Tommy saw that it was a cake of mud from the instep of a man&#39;s boot, and must have dropped off from boots either placed in the cupboard or from the feet of someone standing inside.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Hop Leaf\n\nHawke carefully prodded the mud until it fell apart, and then Tommy saw what his boss was after — a tiny piece of dried-up leaf. For several minutes the famous detective studied it under the magnifying-lens, and then he turned to his young assistant.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s a piece of hop leaf, lad,&quot; he announced, &quot;and the mud itself is from the light, hop-country soil.&quot; Tommy looked puzzled.\n\n&quot;What about it, guv&#39;nor?&quot; he asked. &quot;I don&#39;t see that it helps any.&quot;\n\n&quot;The inside of the cake is still wet,&quot; replied Hawke quietly.\n\n&quot;I see what you mean, sir,&quot; exclaimed Tommy excitedly. &quot;Someone stood in that cupboard only a few hours ago, and left the mud there, mud which belongs to hop-country soil, and ain&#39;t found anywhere else. Then it follows that whoever it was had been in the hop country of Kent just before coming here.&quot;\n\n&quot;Quite right,&quot; smiled Hawke. &quot;And that person was the murderer of Ezra Walker.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then it can&#39;t have been Jim Hardy,&quot; exclaimed Tommy.\n\nDixon Hawke shook his head.\n\n&quot;The man who did the deed was a left-handed man, as I told Forbes; Jim Hardy is right-handed.&quot;\n\nWhen he had finished his examination of the mud cake, Hawke strolled across to a door leading to another room, which the policeman informed him was Mr. Goldman&#39;s office.\n\n&quot;Bit of a shock for Goldman when he comes back,&quot; remarked Tommy, as they came into the partner&#39;s room. &quot;Wonder where he is?&quot;\n\n&quot;Forbes said he was down in the country on business,&quot; said Hawke. &quot;He will first learn the news from the newspapers, I expect, unless the police got in touch with him before. Hullo, more mud!&quot;\n\nThe traces of mud which the keen eyes of the detective had spotted were small, but a brief examination convinced Hawke that it was the same type of Kent hop soil as the original lump he had found in the cupboard.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nHawke Marks His Man\n\nHawke did not bother to make any further observation of the room, but crossed to the door and looked out. From the doorway it was impossible to see either the lift or the main door of the Walker &amp;amp; Goldman offices, as the corridor took a right-angled bend.\n\n&quot;Well, that&#39;s pretty clear,&quot; murmured Hawke, half to himself.\n\n&quot;What is, sir?&quot; asked Tommy, who had overheard the remark.\n\n&quot;That the murderer let himself out of this door while Jim Hardy and the cleaner, Harris, were &#39;phoning the police, and escaped quietly down the back stairs into the courtyard at the rear.&quot;\n\n&quot;How did Hardy&#39;s cap get into the room, then?&quot; asked Tommy.\n\n&quot;The murderer brought it with him, young &#39;un. What he did was this: he got off the lift on the floor below, nipped up the back stairs, took the cap from the cupboard in the corridor, and entered the offices through Goldman&#39;s door here.&quot;\n\n&quot;But,&quot; objected Tommy, &quot;Ezra Walker would be suspicious of a client who came in through his partner&#39;s private door; and how do you account for the main door being locked from the inside? Remember that Jim Hardy was hammering on it mighty soon after the first blow was struck.&quot;\n\nHawke smiled at his young assistant&#39;s puzzled expression. &quot;Probably Walker always kept that door locked when he had an extra valuable packet of diamonds on the premises for valuation. Or the murderer may have suggested that it would be better if the door was locked, in which case it only goes to prove that he was a great friend of Walker&#39;s.\n\n&quot;When Hardy started to hammer on the door, he got the wind up, and dived into a cupboard. When they went off to &#39;phone, he made his getaway.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, I see that, sir,&quot; said Tommy a bit doubtfully, &quot;but I reckon Walker must have been pretty thick with his client to have been such an easy mark. Blokes who deal in diamonds ain&#39;t usually the sort that gets caught napping.&quot;\n\n&quot;How do you know it was a client?&quot; snapped Hawke as he turned away.\n\nTommy Burke&#39;s eyes narrowed as he stared at the broad back of his chief. He knew now who Hawke had marked down as the murderer, but he knew also that it was going to be a hard task for them to prove it.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nUnder the Microscope\n\nThey left the Shaftesbury Avenue offices about ten minutes later, and went back to Dover Street, where Hawke made straight for his laboratory. Taking the black hair he had found on the door from his wallet, he laid it on a specially prepared slide and put it under an extremely powerful lens of the microscope.\n\nTommy heard him give a little exclamation of surprise, and then the detective turned to him with a broad grin on his face.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s a goat&#39;s hair, Tommy,&quot; he announced. &quot;Have a look.&quot;\n\nWhen Tommy looked through the microscope at the strand of hair, he realised that Hawke had spoken nothing more or less than the truth. The hair of a goat grows with a root of unique shape, and may be easily recognised in consequence. In addition, the hair is very broad at the root and tip, but narrow in the middle.\n\n&quot;What docs it signify, sir?&quot; asked Tommy.\n\n&quot;It rather proves that Hardy&#39;s tale of the man with the black beard and dark glasses is absolutely true,&quot; answered the detective. &quot;But the beard was a false one, and made of dyed goat&#39;s hair, the best hair for the purpose, as it is so broad at the root, and looks like real human hair that has been trimmed a lot.\n\n&quot;Next thing to do is to find out where it was bought, and as Clevering&#39;s is so close to Shaftesbury Avenue, we&#39;ll try there first thing in the morning. Most of the theatrical people get their make-up gear from Jack Clevering.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nMr. Goldman Turns Up\n\nTen o&#39;clock next morning saw Tommy Burke off to interview the manager of the theatrical store, and he touched lucky first time.\n\nThe manager remembered selling just such a beard as Tommy described to a gentleman a minute or two before closing time on the previous evening.\n\nHe had an idea that he had seen this gentleman in the neighbourhood quite a lot. In fact, he believed that he was in business somewhere close by, but he did not know his name.\n\nEvery word the outfitter said fitted in with Hawke&#39;s theory, and in Tommy&#39;s mind made it a stonewall certainty.\n\n&quot;Good lad!&quot; was all Hawke said when his assistant told him the result of his inquiry. &quot;Now we&#39;ll get along to Clare Street, and hear any further news Forbes may care to tell us.&quot;\n\nInspector Forbes grinned when he saw them.\n\n&quot;Found the bloke with the pink eyes and blue teeth yet, Hawke?&quot; he gibed.\n\n&quot;Have you found Goldman yet?&quot; Hawke countered.\n\nForbes nodded.\n\n&quot;Yes; he&#39;s been staying the night at Tonbridge. Car broke down, so he hung on overnight. He &#39;phoned us a couple of hours ago. Saw the news of his partner&#39;s murder in the paper this morning, and is coming right here as soon as he arrives in town. Ah, this looks like the man coming in now.&quot;\n\nHawke turned to see a thick-set Jewish-looking man pushing open the door of the police office.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m Goldman,&quot; announced the newcomer as soon as he was inside. &quot;Jove! Inspector, this is a terrible affair. Is it true the lift-boy has been arrested?&quot;\n\n&quot;Quite true, Mr. Goldman,&quot; replied Forbes.\n\nGoldman took off his bowler hat and wiped his forehead.\n\nHawke suddenly bent down and whispered in Tommy&#39;s ear, and the youngster slid quietly out of the police station.\n\n&quot;So Hardy did it, eh?&quot; went on Goldman. &quot;Must have found out somehow that we were expecting a valuable packet of diamonds.&quot;\n\n&quot;I know all about the packet of diamonds,&quot; put in Forbes. &quot;Murdock&#39;s &#39;phoned a description of each stone comprising the parcel as soon as they heard of the murder. They sent the stones to Walker to assess their value.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nLaid by the Heels!\n\nAll this time Hawke had been standing by; now he asked a question.\n\n&quot;Did you ever possess a thick malacca cane, Mr. Goldman?&quot;\n\nGoldman swung round on the detective, and for the fraction of a second a look of fear flashed into his eyes.\n\n&quot;A malacca cane?&quot; he said. &quot;No, but my partner used to have one, which he kept in the office. Why?&quot;\n\n&quot;Because a malacca cane was faked to look like the weapon which murdered your partner,&quot; replied Hawke. &quot;A cane which bore the finger-prints of Hardy upon it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Faked!&quot; gasped Goldman. &quot;Fingerprints on it! Why, sir, if Hardy&#39;s prints were on the weapon, surely he must have committed the murder?&quot;\n\n&quot;The man who committed the crime,&quot; said Hawke, slowly and impressively, &quot;dropped the stick on his way upstairs in the lift and got Hardy to pick it up. That&#39;s how the lad&#39;s finger-prints came to be on it.\n\n&quot;The man was a close friend of Ezra Walker; he hid in the cupboard, and left traces of mud which showed that he had very recently been in Kent, say near Tonbridge, Mr. Goldman. That&#39;s in the hop country. The man was wearing a false beard, composed of hair identical with the one I see now upon the shoulder of your coat, Mr. Goldman.&quot;\n\nWith that Hawke&#39;s hand flashed out and plucked a black hair from Goldman&#39;s coat.\n\nTommy Burke, coming in at the door at that moment, screamed a warning.\n\n&quot;Look out, sir; he&#39;s pulling a gun!&quot;\n\nBut Dixon Hawke had seen the movement, and before the gun was half out of Goldman&#39;s pocket he was upon him. There came the crack of the pistol, but the bullet bit into the floor by Hawke&#39;s feet, and then Forbes was lending a hand.\n\nGoldman fought like a maniac, but, strong as he was, the combined weight of Hawke, Forbes and two constables bore him down, and while he was still on the floor Tommy Burke nipped in and seized his boot heels.\n\nWith a hefty twist he wrenched at them, and both came away in his hands.\n\nA small packet wrapped in tissue paper was inside each of the hollow heels.\n\nSobbing with fear and rage, Goldman was handcuffed, and held tightly by the constables while Forbes cautioned him and then charged him with the murder of Walker.\n\n&quot;And here&#39;s the spanner he did it with,&quot; chipped in Tommy as the inspector finished.\n\nHawke took the tool, wrapped up in a piece of oily rag, and, after a quick look at it, handed it to Forbes.\n\n&quot;Tommy is right,&quot; he said. &quot;Goldman wiped the blood from the spanner with this cloth, and you&#39;ll see there a hail or two which will be found to correspond with the dead man&#39;s hair.\n\n&quot;I sent Tommy out to search the toolbox of Goldman&#39;s car, and he was smart enough to find what was wanted.&quot;\n\n&quot;Look here, Hawke,&quot; said Forbes when the prisoner had been taken away. &quot;I owe you about as big an apology as a man can make. You&#39;ve caught the right man; you&#39;ve got back the diamonds which he parked in those faked heels, and you&#39;ve saved my bacon all the way round.\n\n&quot;But what still puzzles me is how Goldman managed to fake such a perfect alibi. He can prove without a shadow of a doubt that he was in Tonbridge when the murder was committed. How did he do it?&quot;\n\n&quot;Like this,&quot; explained Hawke with a smile. &quot;He had a sham breakdown near Tonbridge, put his car into a garage, booked up at a hotel, and then pretended that he was going back to the garage. Instead he walked into Tonbridge, caught a fast train to London, bought the beard, and worked the finger-prints stunt on Hardy, who failed to recognise him in the disguise, and was quite taken in by the story that he was calling on the insurance company on the fourth floor.\n\n&quot;After the murder he slipped away, caught the 6.35 back to Tonbridge, and turned up at the hotel in time for a late dinner, telling the hotel people that he had been at the garage all the time, or some such yarn.\n\n&quot;He stayed the night there, and any member of the staff would have been ready to swear that Mr. Goldman was in Tonbridge all the afternoon and evening. It was a clever and well-planned murder, but it came unstuck.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~ \n"

Bill, usually a pretty hard-shelled citizen, felt like swearing violently or bursting into tears. But, being a pretty mature young man, he did neither. Instead, he managed a grin.\n\n&quot;Planning to stay awhile?&quot; he asked.\n\nMydans shrugged. He was a hawkfaced, man whose dapper exterior covered a long experience with prison and violence. He had not yet exchanged his two-hundred-dollar suit for prison shoddy. A white carnation, tipped with cerise, adorned his buttonhole.\n\n&quot;A couple of years, I guess,&quot; he replied. &quot;Depends on how I behave.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where&#39;d you put the Mallory jewels, Mydans?&quot; Bill inquired.\n\n&quot;And what would I be doing with the Mallory jewels?&quot; said Mydans. &quot;I&#39;m a pretty ordinary sort of fellow. Why an insurance dick like you would think I have them beats me. You must have run up a sweet swindle sheet chasing me around, Post.&quot;\n\n&quot;I know you took &#39;em,&quot; said Bill, his smile fading. &quot;No one else leaves pink and white carnations lying around a rifled safe.&quot;\n\n&quot;But I was miles away,&quot; said Mydans with a look of bland innocence. &quot;My friends told you all about it in court.&quot;\n\n&quot;I know that fake alibi of yours stood up,&quot; said Bill. He turned away in disgust. By giving himself up on this old charge in Central City, Mydans had effectually spoiled Bill&#39;s pitch. It meant the jewels — a six-figure collection of them — had been safely hidden.\n\n&quot;You might do me a favor,&quot; said the crook insolently. &quot;They don&#39;t give us carnations around here. I&#39;d appreciate if you&#39;d send me one every day. I&#39;d do the same for you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Except that you&#39;re not free, and I&#39;m not in jail, and I don&#39;t like carnations,&quot; growled Bill.\n\nMydans&#39; insolence had gotten under his skin. Knowing that further talk was useless, he left the prison abruptly.\n\nHe&#39;d only missed by a few hours, after a two-week chase. Mydans had gotten away with the loot, and the Twin-American Insurance Company was taking the rap for two hundred G&#39;s. It was Bill&#39;s job, as an investigator on the Twin-A payroll, to get at least some of it back.\n\nSo far, his efforts had amounted to absolutely zero. Mydans had been as elusive as a greased pig. He&#39;d ducked to Canton, Ohio, then to Memphis, getting clear each time just before Bill caught up with him. The detective was quite certain that Mydans had not yet fenced his loot. If it had gone on the underworld market, there&#39;d have been indications the Twin-A couldn&#39;t have missed.\n\nAll he&#39;d done was make it so hot for the crook that the latter had gone to earth in Central City, where a jail sentence was waiting for him from a previous encounter with the men in blue. Evidently Mydans had decided jail was the safest place for him until the heat on the Mallory job died down. Which meant that he&#39;d safely hidden the swag.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nSlayer Of Undertaker Eludes Police Dragnet\n\nBill was in a nasty temper when he strolled back to his hotel. Newsboys did their best to make buildings topple with their shrill yells. Finally the shouts of one of them broke through the detective&#39;s angry mood. Unable to learn what the shouts were about, he grudgingly bought a paper.\n\nWith a grunt he read the bold headline on the front page and the story below it.\n\nMURDERER STILL AT LARGE!SLAYER OF UNDERTAKER ELUDES POLICE DRAGNET\n\nWhile Central City police search feverishly for clues, the killer of undertaker Harlan Brown is still a large X today. Brown, who was slain last night in his office, was listed high in Central City professional and political circles. As police reconstruct the crime, he was at his desk, going over the accounts of the company which bears his name when some person or persons walked in and put a thirty-eight calibre bullet between his eyes.\n\nPatrick Regan, a gravedigger, the only other person near the establishment, heard the shot, but was unable to reach his late employer in time to stop or identify the murderer. Regan had been in charge of the burial of Miss Mary Smith, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Belvedere Smith of this city, which took place two hours earlier. He had returned to the office to report to his employer, and had stopped in the wash room to clean himself up.\n\nBill read the story without much interest. His mind was on the telegram he was going to have to send the Twin-A folk. In view of the dead end to which his investigation had come, it wasn&#39;t a pleasant prospect. His boss would be sore and rightly so. Bill had done his best, but he wasn&#39;t paid for that. He was paid for bringing in the bacon, in this case the Mallory jewels.\n\nThat blasted Mydans! Every time he closed his eyes, Bill could see that blandly insulting hawk face. He could still hear the thief ask for more carnations. The detective reached his hotel, moved toward the elevators, then detoured to the bar cafe. A drink might help him think up something to say to the old man.\n\nIt didn&#39;t, of course. Nor did the second, nor the third. By the time he raised the fourth rye and soda to his lips, he had mentally consigned Mydans and his employer to a very warm place. His boss stayed put there, frying nicely, thank you, but Mydans kept popping back into Bill&#39;s maudlin thoughts — Mydans and those pink and white carnations.\n\nWith the fifth drink, Bill decided those carnations were becoming a fixation. Grimly, he decided to do something about it. With the precision of a brain slightly muddled by alcohol, it seemed to him that the only logical way to rid himself of this fixation was to buy up all the cerise and white carnations in Central City and send them to the thief. This done, he could forget about the whole business for a night at least.\n\nThe first florist he called on shook his head.\n\n&quot;I got white carnations, pink carnations, red carnations, but no pink and white. There&#39;s no demand for them here.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thanks just the same,&quot; said Bill. The same thing happened at three other flower shops.\n\n&quot;For Pete&#39;s sake!&quot; said the detective to the proprietor of the fourth shop when the answer was again no. &quot;A friend of mine likes them. He was wearing a fresh one this morning. Where&#39;d he get it?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said the florist dolefully. &quot;I&#39;d sure like to fill your order, but I don&#39;t know where. Wait! There&#39;s a man who raises carnations over across the river. He sells directly to some of the hotels and funeral parlors.&quot;\n\n&quot;What&#39;s his name?&quot; Bill asked.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nJust An Insurance Guy\n\nSomething in this jarred him, brought him out of his drink-induced fog. He wrote down the florist&#39;s name, went to a drug store and called the man up. It was late, but he got his man at home.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; said the flower dealer, &quot;I do raise them. There isn&#39;t much demand for them in Central City, but I like to have them on hand to play safe. Unfortunately, I sold all I had on hand yesterday.&quot;\n\n&quot;Who&#39;d you sell them to?&quot; asked Bill. He felt a hot hunch burning inside him, just below his diaphragm.&quot;\n\n&quot;I sent them over to a funeral — to that chap Harlan Brown who was shot last night. It was Dr. Smith who ordered them.&quot;\n\nBill hung up cold sober. If the Brown funeral parlor were the only place that had pink and white carnations, then Mydans had been there. And police were still looking for the undertaker&#39;s killer. Riding to the establishment on the rim of town, Bill thought it over.\n\nIt had seemed logical enough that the thief would be willing to serve a short jail sentence with such valuable loot awaiting him on his release. If Mydans had a murder rap hanging over him as well, it seemed many times more logical.\n\nAnd why would Mydans murder the undertaker? Since he was no fool, there had to be a good solid reason. Well, two hundred Gs in pearls, diamonds, rubies and the like were plenty solid. If the undertaker had hidden the stones, Mydans might have decided to rub him out. In Mydans&#39; mind, no friend is true against the temptation of such a haul.\n\nAt first, Bill thought the place was deserted. It was a rambling one-story structure on the very rim of town. Behind it, over rolling hills, were dotted the seemingly endless monuments of Central City&#39;s leading graveyard. A big blue roadster was parked in front of it.\n\nFinally the door was opened. A hulking hairless Hibernian whose rough hands and weather-beaten face gave the lie to his neatly-pressed dark suit answered it. This, Bill hazarded, was Patrick Regan.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m from Twin-American,&quot; Bill said smoothly. He could be smooth when the occasion demanded it. &quot;Mr. Brown had a small policy with us. It is to be paid over to whomever carries on with the business. Can you tell me a little about how things are fixed?&quot;\n\n&quot;Sorry, bub,&quot; said the Hibernian. &quot;I only work here. I wouldn&#39;t know who gets the business.&quot;\n\nHe stayed in the door, blocking most of Bill&#39;s view of the interior. The detective got an impression of hulking strength and — vague fear.\n\n&quot;Who is it?&quot; asked another voice. Bill tried to get to look at its owner without success.\n\n&quot;Just an insurance guy,&quot; said the hairless man. &quot;I don&#39;t know from nothing.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, snap it up, Pat,&quot; he said.\n\nBill smiled, turned to go, managed to stumble against the door. Through it, he was able to take a quick mental photograph of a hulking, long-jawed man with a red face, loud clothes and a glittering diamond horseshoe tie pin. He apologized, went back to his cab.\n\n&quot;Drive around a bit,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to think.&quot;\n\nA dollar and twenty cents later by the meter, he rapped on the window that partitioned the vehicle.\n\n&quot;Hey, cabby,&quot; he said. &quot;Do you know a big guy who wears high-powered clothes and sports a diamond horseshoe in his tie?&quot;\n\n&quot;Who don&#39;t?&quot; said the driver. &quot;I&#39;ve been payin&#39; him most of my dough since I was fourteen. Central City ain&#39;t big enough to have two of him.&quot;\n\n&quot;Okay,&quot; said Bill as patiently as he could. &quot;But who is he?&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s Sean Logan, unless he&#39;s got a carbon copy. He runs the biggest book on the races in town.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nIt Weren&#39;t No Dream\n\nBill did some more figuring while the meter mounted. What would a big-time bookie like Logan be doing with such a son of poverty as Pat Regan? It didn&#39;t make sense, unless — Harlan Brown had been killed after the Smith funeral. The only pink and white carnations in Central City had adorned that funeral. Mydans had been sporting an unwilted pink and white carnation that afternoon. And now Regan, a gravedigger, was in consultation with a big-time bookie.\n\nBill had the cabbie take him to within a quarter of a mile of the mortician&#39;s establishment. It was getting dark now, and he kept in the deepest shadows as he moved carefully toward the one-story structure. Yes, the office lights were still on. Resisting the impulse to light a cigarette, Bill Post sat down at the base of a hedge and prepared to wait it out. The big blue roadster was still out in front.\n\nHis wait was not a long one. As soon as night had fully fallen, the light in the office went out. Regan, attired in coarse grey working clothes came out carrying a pick and spade over his shoulder. With him was Logan, a lantern in his hand, his coat collar turned up against the chill night air.\n\nBill felt excitement rise within him. He knew he was onto something when he followed them, working silently from monument to monument, to keep out of sight. They covered some three hundred yards before they went down into a little ravine. There they stopped by a fresh grave, and Logan lit the lantern.\n\nSteadily the shovel gouged into the freshly turned earth.\n\nKeeping well out of the range of the lantern&#39;s rays, Bill worked closer. His hand slipped under his topcoat, emerged with a very businesslike automatic. Then, he squatted behind a headstone and waited.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re sure you saw them, Pat,&quot; said Logan.\n\n&quot;It weren&#39;t no dream,&quot; said the Irishman, digging stolidly. &quot;I wasn&#39;t supposed to be in the office at all. But my spade broke and I had to go back for another. I saw this friend of the boss&#39; showing them to the boss.&quot;\n\n&quot;A nice friend,&quot; said Logan thoughtfully. &quot;I knew Harlan Brown had his fingers in a lot of pies, but I never figured he&#39;d go for hot stones.&quot;\n\n&quot;You haven&#39;t got a load of these yet,&quot; said Regan.\n\nHis shovel scraped metal a moment later. Peering cautiously around the monument, Bill saw that the grave was open. The hairless Hibernian was busily putting the rollers in place to bring the coffin up.\n\nHe moved with the precision of an experienced veteran. The casket came up evenly, and only a few moments were required to open it. It was lined with white satin. Inside lay a young girl, also in white, still lovely in death.\n\nDisregarding her as if she were the body of a mangy dog, Regan plunged both hands into the foot of the coffin. Despite the cold, his bald dome shone with sweat. He came up with a small casket, ripped at its cover feverishly. A moment later he dangled a loop of pearls in front of Logan, whose eyes narrowed at sight of them.\n\n&quot;Holy suffering cow!&quot; said the bookie softly. &quot;You were right, Pat.&quot;\n\n&quot;I told you so,&quot; said the Irishman aggrievedly. &quot;This ought to even up for what I&#39;ve been owing you and leave a bit over besides.&quot;\n\n&quot;It does, Pat. It does,&quot; said Logan. &quot;All right,&quot; said Bill, covering them with his pistol. &quot;Let&#39;s be getting this stuff back where it belongs.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nCarnations for Carl\n\nLogan and Regan froze. Bill stuffed the stones into his overcoat pocket, kept them at bay with his gun while Regan recovered the casket. Then, leaving it lying atop the reopened grave, he marched them back to the office.\n\nAnd there his two prisoners made a break. Both jumped him at once. The gravedigger literally ripped the coat from his back and fled for the door. Bill put a bullet through his leg and put him out of action. But Logan wasn&#39;t wasting the seconds. He hailed heavy punches off the side of Bill&#39;s head, knocked him reeling to the wall, his senses fading.\n\nA terrific haymaker sent the detective crashing into the office furniture.\n\nFor a moment, he wondered if he were going to lose the game now when he&#39;d come so close to winning. But the very power of the blow gave him his chance.\n\nIt knocked him clear of his opponent, enabled him to recover sufficiently to get his gun down and shatter the man&#39;s kneecap.\n\nFeeling groggily triumphant, he picked up the telephone and called the Central City Police.\n\n&quot;By the way,&quot; he concluded, &quot;you&#39;ll be interested to know that Brown&#39;s murderer has been caught.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where the blankety blank so and so is he?&quot; bellowed an excited police lieutenant.\n\n&quot;In jail,&quot; said Bill hanging up. He&#39;d let them stew for a bit. Then he picked up the phone once more and got the florist across the river.\n\n&quot;Get a bale of those pink and white carnations tomorrow,&quot; he said. &quot;Yes, and send them to Carl Mydans in the city jail. Just say it&#39;s a favor to a friend.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~ \n"

But an early error in judgment regarding New York laws and the course the stock market would take had resulted in his residence there for more than twenty years.\n\nEverybody had liked Hanley and most people liked him still. Ah Fu, his Chinese boy, literally worshipped him. Yet after his initial mistake and narrow escape from a term in Sing Sing, Hanley found that no one but Richard Morely was willing to trust him. It seemed rather unfair. He thought they might have given him another chance without forcing him away from Manhattan; but his wishes in this respect had proved in vain. The onus of his youthful misstep had survived long after the actual circumstances of his defalcation had been forgotten.\n\nIt was true that Hanley had not personally profited by his fraudulent act. Badly advised by his tempters, he had lost every penny of the sum he had embezzled. There were also extenuating circumstances, but the men who had been Hanley&#39;s friends did not wish to continue their association with him, even though some of them refused to prosecute. Others were not so conditionally forgiving, and he had found himself facing a warrant. The woman he loved gave him his congé. Those to whom he appealed for loans to replace what he had stolen turned from him in cold contempt. He was a social outcast — a fugitive from justice — and a penniless, broken-hearted man.\n\nOnly Richard Morely had stood by him. It was Morely who hustled him aboard the train for Canada before the police could arrest him; Morely who arranged his passage on the big P. &amp;amp; O. steamer; and Morely who had given him a job. The whole affair culminated at the time Morely was forming his Yellow Dragon Trading Company. The business was a modest one and demanded but little of its manager besides routine attention. It practically operated itself, yet it was a profitable enterprise and enabled Morely to pay Hanley an adequate salary. That his doing so was little more than charity everyone knew. A local Chinese bank could have handled the matter and undoubtedly would have done so much better than Hanley could.\n\nBut for over a score of years Hanley had spent his days in the little office near the Bund and his nights in the adjoining bungalow, just beyond the European quarter of the city. He belonged to no clubs and had but few intimates — chiefly those of his own ilk, who railed at the despicable climate of Shanghai, despite the fact that they found it more healthy to remain there than to go home. He was a man of pleasing personality and pleasant manners, reserved and soft spoken. He did not play the races and he did not gamble, so far as anyone knew. Most of his spare time was spent alone with his books, and if a woman appeared now and then in his life, no one was aware of it.\n\nThe only living being who really understood Hanley was his native housekeeper, and even Ah Fu was somewhat mistaken in his estimate of the man. At first Hanley had been aided by two assistants, but in time the business grew so automatic, and so relatively unimportant to its owner, that Morely directed him to do without any clerks. Willingly Hanley had dismissed them, and when he had done so, Ah Fu laughed in his flowing sleeve. He had seen for some time that his employer had been ill at ease, and he thought that Hanley breathed a sigh of relief when the others were gone.\n\nAh Fu also knew that Hanley spent very little. He knew that a tidy sum, to which Hanley was ever adding, lay safe in the Manchu Bank. What was more, Ah Fu had gathered that Hanley was discontented, and would welcome the day when his exile might be ever — if ever, indeed, that day should really dawn. Hanley hoped it would, and Ah Fu hoped so, too; for the Chinaman longed to see the rest of the world. He knew that Hanley had grown so used to him that he would keep him as his servant for the rest of his days. Hence the departure of Hanley from Shanghai would mean the beginning of the travels of which Ah Fu dreamed.\n\nHanley had taught him English and something of the business. He had loaned him books and told him stories of other countries, as well as making Ah Fu a sort of secretary. By the time the Chinaman had mastered the spelling of English he had contrived to pick it out on the keys of a typewriter. He would make up long statements each January and July, from lists of figures supplied him by his master. These lists Hanley would compile from the private books he kept — books that were always under lock and key and which no one but Hanley ever looked into.\n\nMorely had not been out to Shanghai since the day of Hanley&#39;s arrival, and the letters the two exchanged were formal in the extreme. Morely had not wished to humiliate his friend by referring to personal matters, and Hanley had not presumed upon the other&#39;s kindness to make their communications savor in any way of a casual correspondence.\n\nAll of which was well enough as long as Morely lived, but shortly after the world war Morely suddenly died. He had not been married and consequently had no direct heirs, but Hanley learned in due time that the estate had been left to a distant cousin. The man&#39;s name was Burson and he lived in San Francisco. It seemed that he had never traveled to the Orient and was suddenly possessed of a strong desire to do so.\n\nHanley dreaded his visit on several scores, neither of which he took occasion to mention to Ah Fu, feeling that the Chinaman could never understand, and that, in any event, it was none of the servant&#39;s business. Hanley believed in keeping his own counsel and in living much by himself, although he was aware that Ah Fu as well as all Shanghai knew of the events which had resulted in his coming there to live.\n\nYet if Ah Fu was honest himself, whether because of virtue, or perhaps from necessity, he seemed to hold no contempt for Hanley on account of his criminal record. In fact, Ah Fu felt that a man who was crafty enough to take advantage of another in the matter of money was a person to be regarded with the greatest of respect. So he typed his letters and made Hanley&#39;s bed, and cooked his employer&#39;s meals, without concerning himself as to what was written in those mysterious books whose pages his eyes had never scanned. But Ah Fu grew troubled as Hanley&#39;s annoyance seemed to increase.\n\nOther letters from San Francisco caused Hanley sleepless nights, and Ah Fu observed with concern that Hanley no longer relished the food he prepared. He wondered whether something might not be wrong, and whether he could not somehow set that matter right. Knowing that Hanley had once been a thief, the Chinaman supposed that he might be again. He shrewdly surmised that those guarded books would divulge the story, if the actual figures in them were ever to become known. That Hanley doctored the financial statements he sent out twice a year. Ah Fu had no doubt. To be able to do such a thing, and to do it for twenty years, was an accomplishment of which Ah Fu would have been proud. In his estimation, Hanley was a brilliant man.\n\nBut be that as it might, he was a obviously worried one. His restlessness grew with the coming of each steamer, and Ah Fu heard him sigh with relief when it was announced by letter that the new owner of the Yellow Dragon Trading Company had decided not to come out. Instead, he was informed, Mr. Burson was sending an auditor over from Hong Kong. The man would look over the books and also look over the ground. He would decide whether or not it would be best to continue the business or to close up its affairs. The latter would mean Hanley&#39;s dismissal, if it resulted in nothing else — and Hanley did not know what he would do in that event.\n\nNo one in Shanghai would give him a job. The charge which stood against him back in New York was outlawed by time, of course; but the memory of the man and his folly had not passed from the minds of those who still remembered him. He could not go back to the States. He had no money with which to travel elsewhere — and he did not want those books to be examined.\n\nAh Fu sensed this from his master&#39;s manner rather than from anything Hanley said. He only knew that Hanley viewed with apprehension, the arrival of the auditor who was coming from Hong Kong.\n\nAt first Ah Fu was puzzled and then grew upset himself. He would gladly have laid down his life for his master, but sacrificing his life would not seem to help in this instance. Yet Ah Fu was far from being stupid. He had a mind that was keen in its Oriental cunning. Now was the time to employ in the service of his master the abilities with which he had been born.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nClayburne – Financial Efficiency Engineer\n\nAh Fu said nothing, but went quietly v about his business, and Hanley had no inkling of what was in the Chinaman&#39;s mind. He did not even know that the servant suspected him of having been steadily robbing the Morely estate. Yet this was precisely what Ah Fu did imagine, and what he fully intended to try to conceal. With the falsifying of books, he had no familiarity, and no desire to learn. Such methods were utterly foreign to his plan of procedure. His manner of mending matters would be more direct and simple, and by far more effective. All that remained to be done was to await the arrival of the stranger who was en route from Hong Kong.\n\nIn the course of three weeks he came. The man&#39;s name was Clayburne, and young as he was in business, he had built up a reputation as a financial efficiency engineer. He had faith in the Orient as a place in which to make money, but he was the relentless foe of antiquated methods. Naturally, he assumed that the system of running the Yellow Dragon Trading Company was at least a decade behind the time, and surmised that a lot of red tape and lost motion, and perhaps inefficiency, would have to he eliminated if the concern was to go on. That was what he had come to Shanghai prepared to find out, at the instance of Mr. Burson.\n\nHanley, pale and nervous, met him at the dock, and greeted the auditor as cordially as he could. Clayburne pretended not to notice the other&#39;s all too evident perturbation, but what he did see, plus what he knew of Hanley, made him decide at once that something was wrong.\n\nHanley realized his attitude, and resented it keenly. Ah Fu sized up the situation at once, and quickly made up his mind. However, he outdid himself in preparing the evening meal and in making the new arrival comfortable in the bungalow. He served the two Americans in silence and kept them well supplies with liquors and cigars, listening with the sharpest of ears to each sentence the men exchanged.\n\nThat the business had fallen off in the last five years, Ah Fu had known before hand. That Mr. Morely had been indifferent to whether or not it paid, he had not known before. Morely, in fact, would never have consented to a discontinuance which might cost Hanley his job. He had been that type of man, and the maintenance of his former friend in this quiet berth was only another one of his many secret and worthy charities. To Mr. Clayburne, the thing which he suspected made Hanley&#39;s probable offense all the more reprehensible under such circumstances.\n\n&quot;Once a crook — always a crook!&quot; he mused at the close of the dinner. &quot;There&#39;s no such thing as a defaulter ever going straight.&quot;\n\nIt seemed as though Ah Fu read his mind, but so far as his features indicated such knowledge he might have been a graven image. If Hanley was conscious of the other&#39;s mental attitude, he did not outwardly evidence the fact, but he found himself more restless than ever after dinner when the two sat out on the porch overlooking the harbor and the lights of the city.\n\n&quot;When do you wish to start in?&quot; Hanley asked with a queer sort of catch in his voice.\n\n&quot;In the morning,&quot; the auditor said, &quot;and finish as soon as I can. Mr. Burson wants my report to go back by the Pacifica and the ship will sail on Tuesday. So there&#39;s no time to be lost.&quot;\n\nSo it seemed, Hanley observed.\n\n&quot;Quite so,&quot; thought Ah Fu, but he was not thinking of the task the auditor had to perform, but of the little job he personally had in mind.\n\nIn the kitchen, he went about his tasks without so much as a word, and at last, when all was in order, he slipped out into the night. He said nothing to his employer about his going, and naturally did not confide to him what he proposed to do. But half an hour later he was in the shop of Moy Su down in the Nanking Road.\n\nWith Moy Su he exchanged a few complimentary salutations, felicitated him upon his ancestors, and requested Moy Su to do him a favor. Moy Su, without the impertinence of asking questions, consented to do as he was requested, and Ah Fu went on his way.\n\nTen minutes later Hanley was summoned to the telephone in his little bungalow. It was Moy Su who greeted him respectfully and begged a thousand pardons for disturbing him at that hour. He made no mention of Ah Fu, a visitor was in the company of Hanley, nor did he refer to the fact that he knew Moy Su was not supposed to be aware of such things, and Hanley naturally never associated the call with the departure of his servant.\n\nMoy Su wished to know whether Hanley would care to come to his shop that evening to see a shipment of reprehensibly inferior jades he had just received. The stuff was the merest trash, Moy Su explained, yet it had the appearance of being very good. It was just such merchandise as Hanley sometimes purchased and sent to America in the course of his business. Moy Su wished Hanley to have first choice of the jades, should Hanley wish to buy them, and on the following morning he had promised to exhibit them publicly.\n\nHanley thanked the merchant for his courtesy and decided to go at once. Normally he would have told the Chinaman to go to the devil. Twenty years in Shanghai had not tended to speed up his methods of business or make him unduly active in matters of this sort. Now, however, under the watchful eye of Clayburne, he thought it might be good policy to show interest and act upon the opportunity at once. He felt that it was incumbent upon him to make a show of enterprise and devotion to duty. So he told the auditor the purport of the phone call and asked whether he would care to accompany him.\n\n&quot;No,&quot; declined Clayburne, &quot;I&#39;m rather tired tonight, and I haven&#39;t quite got my land legs as yet. I know nothing about the value of such things anyway. I can tell from a set of books whether a business pays, but I couldn&#39;t determine the worth of actual merchandise on a bet.&quot;\n\nHanley was just as well satisfied. He would welcome being relieved of the auditor&#39;s society for an hour or so at least. The thing he would have to face would be unpleasant enough when he came to it the following morning. Then would take place the interview Hanley had dreaded for years — the inevitable nemesis he knew he must encounter. And Clayburne gave no sign of being likely to be a sympathetic listener to the news which awaited him.\n\n&quot;Then,&quot; said Hanley, &quot;I&#39;ll run down and see this man, if you don&#39;t mind. Just make yourself at home and I&#39;ll return as soon as I can.&quot;\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t hurry,&quot; yawned the auditor, evidently equally willing to be rid of his host. &quot;Sandman&#39;s after me and I think I&#39;ll turn in soon.&quot;\n\n&quot;By all means,&quot; invited Hanley. &quot;My boy has gone out, I think, but I&#39;ll see myself that everything&#39;s in order in your room.&quot;\n\nHe did; arranged various articles to insure the comfort of his unwelcome guest, and then went out, first slipping an automatic into his trousers pocket. He had hesitated at first to take the gun, and finally did so with the thought of protection rather than with the intention of employing the weapon for any other purpose.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nWhether Hanley Was A Coward\n\nThe night was balmy and clear, so he went on foot to the shop where Moy Su was waiting, bowing and scraping and ready to pay him fulsome compliments while he bargained with him. Yet it developed that there was to be no business transacted that night. Indignantly, Hanley spurned the offered jades and roundly admonished Moy Su for even summoning him to look at such trash. He would have none of it. Genuinely annoyed at the merchant and out of sorts with himself, he went out into the night, and retraced his steps.\n\nAs he pondered over the situation, his fingers closed on the gun in his pocket. Perhaps, after all, that was the way out. He knew what Clayburne would find when he looked at the books, and he appreciated that nothing he might say would explain away those facts. His previous story was already known by the new owner, and Hanley did not deceive himself that Clayburne would believe him or that Burson would forgive him. After all, it might be as well to blow out his brains and have done with it. Perhaps he should have done so twenty years ago. Life had held nothing worth while for him since he had left New York, and he supposed it never would. There seemed but little purpose in his carrying on.\n\nBut whether Hanley was a coward, or whether it was because he scorned a cowardly act, he took his hand from the gun and resolved not to use it. Whatever the result might be, he meant to go over the books with Clayburne in the morning and confess to him the truth. They might accept his statement or reject it as they pleased. They might do with him as they liked. Hanley did not care — and that was the simple truth. If he could not vindicate himself — and he did not believe he could — nothing really mattered. He had tried his best but fate seemed to be against him.\n\nThen, as he walked up the lonely road, lined on each side with tall trees, he heard a noise just ahead and a great, threatening shape hurled itself at him with a savage snarl. Thrusting his hand into his pocket, he squeezed the automatic, discharging it without troubling to take it out of his pocket.\n\nThe bullet ripped his trousers, and flew wild. But a moment later, as he stood with the weapon in his hand, Hanley laughed at himself. Down the road a big, terrified dog was scampering. He could plainly see its shadowy outlines as it rushed through the open.\n\nHe was nervous, that was all. There had been no real danger and the animal was only frightened at suddenly coming upon him in the darkness. So he trudged on toward his home at a leisurely pace, until his attention was attracted by a glare in the sky. An uneasy fear came over him and he quickened his footsteps, to pause on the edge of the clearing with an exclamation of horror.\n\nHis little bungalow and the shack he used as an office were enveloped in flames. Flimsy of construction, the rickety building was burning like tinder. Situated in a lonely spot upon the hillside, it had not as yet been observed by anyone else.\n\nWith a shout he dashed on — but his cries brought neither aid nor any response from the bungalow.\n\nArriving before the door, he called out Clayburne&#39;s name repeatedly, but the crackle of the flames and the roar of their triumph were his only answer. To attempt to enter the building would have been madness, and the roof crumbled in while he stood there helpless.\n\nNow he heard others approaching, and he felt a sickening sensation. The crazy fire apparatus was also on its way at a far too leisurely gait. They might as well spare their pains.\n\nIn a daze himself, Hanley tried vainly to answer a dozen questions at once. To each interrogator he told the simple truth — and each one of them smiled. The arrival of Clayburne and his presence in the bungalow had been known. The intention of the owner of the Yellow Dragon Trading Company to wind up his business had been noised abroad; and Hanley&#39;s previous record was not any secret to his neighbors. Moreover, he stood there idiotically with a pistol clasped in his hand. People stared at him strangely.\n\nBut when the fire had burned itself out and the ruins were cooled with water, the crowd began to search with the aid of lanterns. The Chinese police were darting about like dogs upon the scent, and now they dragged from what had been the office two badly charred, dead bodies. The clothes had been burned from both, but the mystery of it was, why the two victims had been unable to get out. Despite the rapidity with which the flames had spread, a leap through the door or a window would have brought them both to safety.\n\nThen the police found out why they had died, and they turned to Hanley, who stared at them in return and gaped at the charred bodies in stunned amazement. Buried in the breast of the auditor was a long Chinese knife. Through the lungs of Ah Fu, a forty-four bullet had passed. A policeman relieved Hanley of his weapon and carefully noted its calibre.\n\nNot a vestige of furniture remained in the place. The little office with its books and papers and records of twenty years, was completely wiped out. At the same time the life of the man who had come to examine them had been taken — not by the flames which charred his body, but by the steel which still stuck into his breast. Ah Fu, who also knew a great deal about the business, had passed on to the Terrace of Perpetual Sleep.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nCrude Fiction\n\nOf course, they arrested Hanley and clapped him into jail. The examining magistrate smiled at the story of the dog, although Moy Su confirmed the visit of Hanley to his little shop. Moy Su, however, made no mention of the reason why he had telephoned, and only when opportunity came did he slip a note for Hanley into the hands of his lawyer.\n\nThat note raised the hopes of the man who was going to defend the accused, even though it told Hanley that his case was hopeless. The communication was from Ah Fu and it was done on the typewriter. Hanley knew, of course, that the Chinaman had written it — but there was nothing to prove this fact to a jury. Even the signature could not be confirmed. None had ever seen it. The Chinaman had never thought of that — nor had he planned as shrewdly as his devotion had prompted.\n\nFor a moment Hanley looked at the typewritten text, and then tossed it away with a contemptuous laugh, as its worthlessness and the grim humor of the situation fully dawned upon him:\n\nTo Honorable Police, Shanghai, China from Ah Fu now intending to make himself quite dead. Honorable Mr. Hanley know nothing about killing the auditing pig. Ah Fu have plenty cause hate him man Claybrne. Why so nobody business. Ah Fu stab auditing pig and then take poison to go join little lotus flower because why he kill Clayburne.\n\nIt was crude fiction. Not even Hanley even pretended to believe it; yet he saw in an instant what the Chinaman had done and why he had done it. He told the lawyer and the attorney understood, but he also realized the utter impossibility of convincing the court.\n\nFiguring that Clayburne would find something wrong with Hanley&#39;s books, the devoted servant had planned to not only kill the auditor, but to destroy the evidence of his master&#39;s supposed guilt. The pretended reason for his committing the crime was of course absurd invention. Hanley did not even know whether Ah Fu possessed a sister or a sweetheart. If the Chinaman had either, Hanley knew that Clayburne had never even seen such a girl any more than had he.\n\nEvidently, however, Ah Fu had gone first to kindle the fire, and had then intended to finish Clayburne and later still attend to the taking of his own life. Perhaps he feared that if he lived to be questioned, he might break down under the examining of the magistrate and recant his confession, thus at least compromising his master. By dying himself, he had evidently decided, everything would be well. All Hanley had to do, Ah Fu thought, was to hold his tongue, and no one would be the wiser.\n\nAnd indeed such might have been the case, had it not been for two things which Ah Fu did not foresee. He had not figured the possibility of Clayburne&#39;s discovering him in the act of kindling the fire. The knife he had hurled at the auditor had indeed found its mark, but not before Clayburne&#39;s bullet had reached Ah Fu. Thus the two wounded men died in the flames. That in itself would not have convicted Hanley.\n\nBut even the wisest of Chinamen, with the best of misguided intentions, could not have anticipated that Clayburne would earn a gun of precisely the same calibre as Hanley&#39;s. Nor could he have surmised that a stray, dog in the woods would cause Hanley to fire a shot under circumstances which he could not prove.\n\nAs it was, everything pointed to Hanley&#39;s having fired the shack himself. Evidence indicated that he had murdered his guest and his servant — one because of what he might discover in going over his books — and the Chinese boy because he knew or saw too much. The very fact that Clayburne had been slain with a Chinese knife looked like a clumsy attempt on Hanley&#39;s part to direct suspicion against the Chink. That one shell was missing from Clayburne&#39;s gun was perfectly natural. It was supposed he had fired in self defense and that his bullet had caused the rent in Hanley&#39;s trousers — the tear which he claimed had been caused by his own shot. It was apparently only a miracle that the ball had not lodged in Hanley&#39;s leg.\n\nIn the face of such supposition, Hanley might plead his innocence as much as he pleased — but he could not contravert the facts as the searchers saw them.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s tough, old man,&quot; his attorney declared, &quot;but we&#39;ll do all we can for you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Save your pains!&quot; Hanley said with disgust. &quot;It isn&#39;t worth while. You see, the thing that poor Ah Fu did not know is that I was really honest — &quot;\n\nThe lawyer suppressed a smile which Hanley was quick to note. It confirmed his resignation to his fate.\n\n&quot;Of course you think I&#39;m lying — not about the murders — but about the money. Yet it&#39;s gospel truth I&#39;m telling. About five years ago one of my assistants got away with some twelve thousand dollars before I learned of it. I only found it out after Morely had told me to discharge him. Then, when he had disappeared, I was afraid to speak — naturally imagining that Morely would think I&#39;d reverted to type and was merely trying to clear myself by telling a fanciful tale. There was nothing but silence left for me, because the fellow had cleverly forged my handwriting in making false entries in my private set of books — &quot;\n\n&quot;Did Ah Fu know that?&quot; asked the lawyer, and Hanley shook his head.\n\n&quot;He couldn&#39;t have known — but in some way or other he scented that something was not just right, and he undoubtedly supposed that I was the crook.&quot;\n\n&quot;Would those false entries have been discovered by the auditor?&quot; the attorney queried.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; assented Hanley, &quot;and I would have explained them. In that way I could have shown why the figures and the cash in tire bank did not agree. Also that the thefts occurred while I had an assistant. Clayburne might have scoffed at me, but I meant to put every card on the table. With the books to show, I might have been able to make them believe me. As it stands, when they learn that the books are gone, they&#39;re certain to consider that I destroyed them and killed Clayburne and Ah Fu in going about it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Perhaps,&quot; the lawyer agreed. &quot;Is there anything in your private accounts or in your bank transactions that would suggest that you appropriated the money ?&quot;\n\n&quot;No,&quot; said Hanley. &quot;And nothing to show I didn&#39;t. Yet, as a matter of fact, I&#39;ve drawn only half my salary each month since I made the discovery. I wanted to put the money back and thus prevent all chance of my ever being accused. Clayburne arrived about a year too soon. I hadn&#39;t quite made it good.&quot;\n\nFor a moment he was silent, and then he shrugged his shoulders and laughed bitterly.\n\n&quot;As it stands, Ah Fu&#39;s useless and foolish sacrifice not only fails to clear me, but establishes a motive which brands me as a crook as well as a murderer. He has even burned up the deposit book, which would show my honest efforts at restitution. I haven&#39;t a Chinaman&#39;s chance of proving that I&#39;ve played straight since my first and only mistake.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m genuinely sorry for you, Hanley,&quot; sympathized the attorney. &quot;It&#39;s rotten, too, after the devotion which prompted that crazy yellow heathen to give his life for you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Be sorry for him, not for me,&quot; Hanley smiled. &quot;If the world&#39;s going to think I stole Morely&#39;s money after all his kindness. I&#39;d just as leave be hung for murder. Poor Ah Fu did the best he knew how when he tried to help me out; but the foolish fellow will be tortured through eternity when he learns — as the dead surely must do — what a sorry mess his good intentions really made of things.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~ \n"

It bore the following inscription:\n\nORR &amp;amp; ORR DETECTIVE AGENCYScientific Criminal Investigators\n\nInside the small office, Catherine was saying, &quot;I&#39;m afraid for him. I don&#39;t know why, but — I just feel something might happen.&quot;\n\nOrville Orr grinned at his wife across the wide expanse of His desk.\n\n&quot;Nonsense,&quot; he admonished. &quot;Nelson knows how to take care of himself. If anything were wrong, he&#39;d have called us.&quot;\n\nThe blond, petite Catherine wasn&#39;t convinced. She bit her underlip, went around the desk and sat on Orr&#39;s lap.\n\n&quot;You don&#39;t understand,&quot; she argued. &quot;He&#39;s already found this formula; he discovered it this past month. It&#39;s proved successful in all the monkey experiments. It&#39;s certain it&#39;ll prove successful on humans.&quot;\n\nOrr — hard-hitting, dark-haired and wiry — gazed at her patiently. She was referring to one of their best friends. But Orr already knew Dr. Nelson had discovered a specific therapy for the treating of cholera.\n\n&quot;Please!&quot; Catherine begged. &quot;At least call him. Something must have happened or he wouldn&#39;t have broken that luncheon appointment.&quot;\n\nOrr scowled but reached for the phone and got an out-of-town number. The scowl disappeared from his face as an excited voice came over the wire. Catherine stared at him.\n\n&quot;Your hunch was right.&quot; Orr swore. &quot;Culler just found Dr. Nelson dead in his room. Thinks a monkey bit him and that he died of cholera.&quot; He added tensely: &quot;We&#39;re going out there.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Monkey Farm\n\nDr. Nelson&#39;s residence — the papers called it a monkey farm —  was outside the city limits. It was a comfortable, two-story stone structure. Behind it was a wire-covered, tropical-like garden where the monkeys were kept.\n\nOrville Orr parked his coupé behind a large sedan, and he and Catherine got out. A bony, red-faced youth ran out of the house to meet them. He was Vic Culler, Dr. Nelson&#39;s handy man.\n\n&quot;It is cholera!&quot; he cried. &quot;Dr. Torgerson says it is.&quot;\n\nHe led the two newcomers into the house.\n\nIn the front room were two grave-faced men. One was Dr. Torgerson — a small, fussy, potbellied individual — who had been working on the cholera experiments with Nelson. The second man — husky, blond-haired and clad in a leather jacket and corduroy trousers — was Dennis Spight. He was Torgerson&#39;s assistant.\n\n&quot;No doubt about it,&quot; Torgerson revealed fussily. &quot;It&#39;s cholera — the disease we were fighting.&quot;\n\nOrr quickly gathered the main facts. Vic Culler had got the day off. He&#39;d come in about twenty minutes ago and had found Dr. Nelson dead in his bedroom. Two large monkeys were in there. There had been a struggle inside; Nelson had undoubtedly been attacked by them.\n\n&quot;They jumped me, too,&quot; Culler added. &quot;I had to kill both.&quot;\n\n&quot;Culler phoned us and then you called,&quot; Dennis Spight offered nervously.\n\nOrr and Catherine exchanged glances. She asked Vic Culler: &quot;When did you see Dr. Nelson last – alive?&quot;\n\nThe youth swallowed.\n\n&quot;I — it was yesterday noon, when I fed the monkeys.&quot;\n\nOrr asked Torgerson: &quot;Can we go see the body?&quot;\n\nThe doctor looked at his watch.\n\n&quot;If you want; but just for a moment,&quot; he replied uneasily. &quot;I&#39;m having the room disinfected. Too much risk of an epidemic starting.&quot;\n\nHe led the way up the stairs, turned right. There was a door at the left in the hallway. Torgerson said:\n\n&quot;The room&#39;s got a strong gas, so take a long breath before you look inside.&quot; He threw the door open.\n\nOrr drew back horrified at sight of the dead man. Catherine, behind him, gasped.\n\nNelson — a middle-aged, bald-headed man — lay curled up on the bed, fully dressed. His lips were blackish-blue, his face ghastly pale.\n\nThe room itself showed signs of a struggle, as had been said. The two monkeys — large, black-faced specimens — were sprawled out dead before the bed. Culler had shot both.\n\nTorgerson closed the door, and they started down the stairway. Several men were coming in through the front door: the county coroner, the sheriff and several others.\n\nOrr and Catherine spoke to them briefly and went outside. They got into their small coupé to wait. They knew there&#39;d be little to be learned in the house just now. As Torgerson had said, they were running the risk of contracting the fatal and very infectious disease.\n\nOrr gazed grimly at his wife. &quot;You don&#39;t by any chance think it&#39;s — murder, Catherine?&quot;\n\n&quot;I wish I could be sure. If it is murder, it&#39;s so clever that we&#39;ll probably never prove it.&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you mean?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; Catherine said tensely. &quot;You know Dr. Nelson was to get a hundred and twenty thousand dollars from a foreign government if he discovered a worthy therapy for cholera. It&#39;s a problem on which a number of prominent doctors all over the world have been working.&quot;\n\nOrr&#39;s lips thinned. &quot;There&#39;s a motive in that all right. Nelson was working with Torgerson. Torgerson was to get forty per cent if they succeeded.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Formula\n\nBefore them now. Dr. Torgerson and Spight were coming toward their sedan. Orr honked, calling the potbellied doctor. He asked him:\n\n&quot;Now that Nelson&#39;s dead, what becomes of the formula?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Torgerson said worriedly. &quot;Nelson hid it somewhere, but I don&#39;t know where. Naturally I&#39;m interested; I&#39;m to get money out of it. I worked with Nelson for the past two years on the thing.&quot;\n\n&quot;What about Mr. Spight?&quot; Catherine asked softly.\n\n&quot;He&#39;ll get ten per cent of what I get,&quot; the doctor said, slightly annoyed. &quot;He&#39;s just been with me five months, but I promised him that.&quot;\n\nHe glanced toward Spight, then joined him. Both got in their car and drove off.\n\n&quot;Now about this Vic Culler?&quot; Orr murmured.\n\n&quot;He looks innocent enough,&quot; Catherine ventured. &quot;But of course — &quot;\n\nShe hesitated. The skinny county coroner was coming toward them.\n\nHe whined out troubledly: &quot;We gotta be careful of this cholera disease.&quot;\n\n&quot;How do you think Dr. Nelson contracted the disease?&quot; Catherine inquired.\n\n&quot;From them monkeys, lady. Got bitten by &#39;em. The two thet were in his room were the two thet had the germs.&quot;\n\nOrr frowned. &quot;How&#39;d the monkeys ever get up into his room?&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, that&#39;s possible. Thet Culler kid says he sometimes had &#39;em around his lab downstairs. They just went on up the stairs. Monkeys are smart little creatures.&quot;\n\nOrr nodded. The explanation was possible, but he still wasn&#39;t satisfied. After the coroner and his men left, taking the body, he asked Catherine:\n\n&quot;How long does it take for a person to die of cholera?&quot;\n\n&quot;From what I remember,&quot; she said, &quot;it might be a few hours — or days.&quot;\n\nHe stared fixedly toward his dead friend&#39;s house, eyes troubled and thoughtful. If it just wasn&#39;t for the formula part now, he would have agreed with the others. He would have let the case pass on as a terrible accident, due to Nelson&#39;s carelessness.\n\n&quot;Say!&quot; he exclaimed suddenly. &quot;What&#39;s that smoke?&quot;\n\nQuickly he got out and ran down the sidewalk and around the side of the house, with the startled Catherine following. From behind, Orr had seen trails of smoke go up into the late afternoon sky.\n\nThe weird chattering of excited monkeys came from the gardens now. Turning at the rear of the house, Orr stopped shortly.\n\nVic Culler was piling wood on a large fire. He whirled frightenedly.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s the idea ?&quot; Orr demanded.\n\n&quot;Why, I — I&#39;m going to destroy these two dead monkeys,&quot; Culler explained. He indicated a gunny sack at his side.\n\n&quot;Mr. Spight said I should. They&#39;re infected. Dr. Nelson was experimenting with &#39;em.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;d better go,&quot; Orr said grimly. &quot;We&#39;ll take care of the monkeys.&quot;\n\nA slow smirk crossed the youth&#39;s face.\n\n&quot;Suit yourself,&quot; he said. He hurried to a battered flivver behind a gate by the monkey gardens; then he was driving off.\n\nThe fire was now going out; Orr threw dirt on it. Some twenty yards behind him, in the monkey gardens, the little jungle beasts were whimpering and jumping around their large cages.\n\n&quot;Sorry, fellas,&quot; Orr grinned at them grimly, &quot;but we&#39;re going to have to take your two dead pals to town.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nVibrio Comma\n\nIt was late that night when Catherine Orr looked up from her microscope. Stretching a little, she said, tiredly: &quot;That&#39;s the last of it. There&#39;s an undue amount of the Vibrio comma in the blood of these monkeys. Then their skins are punctured in several places — and not from bites or bruises.&quot;\n\nOrr came to his feet, eyes hardening.\n\n&quot;Someone must have injected the disease into &#39;em! Nelson never did; he always let &#39;em get it much as a human would — through contaminated food or water.&quot; He tapped a thick medical book.\n\n&quot;Then it says here this cholera Vibrio seldom if ever invades the blood stream.&quot; Catherine nodded. &quot;Yes, and another thing is, the disease gains entrance by way of the gastro-intestinal tract. That would mean we should have found cholera germs in the mouths. But my findings there are all negative.&quot;\n\nMuscles knotted in Orr&#39;s throat. He knew now that if the two monkeys had been given cholera germs by Nelson, his specific therapy had made them immune to the disease. And they would have had the germs in the intestinal tract — not the blood. He said tonelessly:\n\n&quot;The more I think of this, the more I believe it&#39;s murder.&quot; Seething rage rode his brain with the thought. &quot;And if it is murder,&quot; he went on bitterly, &quot;we&#39;ve got to prove it!&quot;\n\nHalf an hour later, they were back at the dead Dr. Nelson&#39;s monkey farm. The night was moonless, ominously dark. They went around the house to the monkey garden.\n\nCatherine had learned the cage number of the dead animals earlier in the day. They neared the place now, hoping for a new lead.\n\nCatherine suddenly stopped dead still. She grabbed Orr&#39;s arm, whispered: &quot;I —  I think some one&#39;s coming!&quot;\n\nFrom behind the garden, there was the faint but unmistakable sound of footsteps. Abruptly, as though warned by this, the caged monkeys began a frantic, maddening chatter. Orr gave silent thanks that he and Catherine had driven in without lights; that they&#39;d made little noise.\n\nSome ten yards away from them now, a low voice ground out angry curses. The footsteps continued.\n\nStraining his eyes, Orr saw a shadow go toward the two-story house. The intruder faded into the blackness. Behind, the monkeys ceased their jabbering; became sepulchrally silent.\n\nThen, from the direction of the towering mass of darkness that was the house, there came the whack-whack-whack sounds of something striking dirt.\n\n&quot;He must be digging,&quot; Catherine breathed fearfully into her husband&#39;s ear.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Orr breathed back tightly.\n\nHe waited for what was at least ten minutes, while the digging continued. Then, as it stopped, he slid forward. Catherine followed.\n\nOrr, gun and flashlight now out, kept moving. But just as he was about to snap the light, his foot caught over something  — the pile of unburned wood with which Vic Culler was going to destroy the monkeys.\n\nThere was a loud, cracking snap. Orr&#39;s foot had crushed a stick. He instinctively stumbled forward, half jumping to prevent his falling.\n\nBefore him, the unknown newcomer was darting toward the side of the house. Simultaneously, a gun was roaring thunderous loud in his hand.\n\nCatherine screamed. Orr dropped, blazing back at the seeing shadow. He dared not turn on his light, for fear of offering too good a target.\n\nAnd then something struck him on the temple with savage impact; lightning seemed to dance madly in his skull. Then he was going down into a pit of horrible nothingness.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nA Small, Ironclad Box\n\nHe came to with the screeching cries of the terrified monkeys in his ears. Someone was shaking him, saying:\n\n&quot;Oh, darling, are you hurt? Are you hurt?&quot;\n\nOrr sat erect. Catherine wiped blood from his cheek and head.\n\n&quot;I — I&#39;m all right,&quot; he said dazedly. &quot;You?&quot;\n\n&quot;I lost my head,&quot; she sobbed. &quot;I — I couldn&#39;t help screaming.&quot;\n\nHe felt his head. The bullet had grazed his right temple.\n\n&quot;What became of him?&quot;\n\n&quot;He got away,&quot; Catherine explained. &quot;Drove off in a car he had parked down the road. I got your gun and fired back  — but I&#39;m sure I missed.&quot;\n\nOrr stood up, and he and Catherine went to the side of the house. He flashed his light on the spot where the other had dug.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t get too close!&quot; Orr warned. Dug against the side of the house, was a hole about two feet deep. Around it in spots, the dirt was slightly tamped, as though with wires. But what caught Orr&#39;s eye was a small, ironclad box at the bottom of the hole — chained to several water pipes.\n\n&quot;Dr. Nelson&#39;s formula!&quot; Orr gasped. &quot;That&#39;s what the fellow who came here wanted. It&#39;s beginning to look more and more like murder.&quot; He turned to his wife. &quot;What did that car sound like?&quot;\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t hear it very well, for worrying about you. But it didn&#39;t sound like Culler&#39;s car.&quot;\n\n&quot;He could have used another one,&quot; Orr said.\n\nHe stared wonderingly at the ironlike box. It was the same size as a nickel match box, but the padlock under one of its rungs was nearly twice as large. Orr kept staring at this and the freshly dug dirt. Then an icy thought struck his brain, and he snapped:\n\n&quot;We&#39;ve got to act quick, Catherine. I think I know how we can get this guy.&quot; He led Catherine to the front of the house. &quot;This isn&#39;t exactly legal,&quot; he announced, &quot;but we can&#39;t take time to be too careful!&quot;\n\nWith his gun muzzle, he poked a hole in a window, turned the window-latch. He went in and made three phone calls. Coming back out quickly, he said:\n\n&quot;One was to Vic Culler. He lives at the Lincoln Hotel in Carbondale, about three miles away from here. Hotel operator says he ain&#39;t in. I called Dr. Torgerson&#39;s house — it&#39;s about two miles down the road — and he&#39;s not in. Spight, who lives with him, says he&#39;s in town on business. I also got the sheriff.&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you plan to do?&quot; Catherine asked tremulously.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going to round up everybody. They should be here within forty-five minutes.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nDr. Nelson Was Murdered\n\nThe sheriff, bringing two deputies, came first.\n\n&quot;Wait here with my wife,&quot; Orr ordered. &quot;I&#39;ll be back soon.&quot;\n\nThey were waiting for him, impatiently, when he got back — Dr. Torgerson, Dennis Spight, and Vic Culler, together with the county lawmen.\n\nCatherine had turned on the lights of the coupé, and everyone stood before these.\n\n&quot;See here, Orr,&quot; Torgerson rapped. &quot;You can&#39;t keep us here. I had important business in town; the sheriff brought me here much against my will.&quot;\n\n&quot;You were in town,&quot; Orr cut in, voice edged. &quot;And you, Spight?&quot;\n\n&quot;Why, I was home, reading.&quot; Dennis Spight shuffled his feet uneasily.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t have to believe that,&quot; Orr commented. &quot;What about you. Culler?&quot;\n\nThe red-faced youth had trouble speaking.\n\n&quot;I — I had stepped out to buy a paper when you called. The sheriff got me, too. I — I don&#39;t know what this is all about!&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, tell us, Orr,&quot; mattered the burly sheriff. &quot;Your wife says yuh got somethin&#39; important.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, sheriff,&quot; Orr began, &quot;it is important. Dr. Nelson didn&#39;t just die accidentally. He was murdered!&quot;\n\nThere was a stunned silence. Then Torgerson cried thickly: &quot;Murdered! Ah  — why that&#39;s insane, man! What proof have you?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve got proof,&quot; Orr said, voice steely. His eyes drilled into the three suspects; watched every move they made.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; he went on. &quot;Nelson finally found this specific therapy for the cure and immunizing of cholera. You, Torgerson, and Spight, were to share in the prize money from the foreign government. Culler here was just working for wages. Then one of you got greedy — and killed him.&quot;\n\nQuestions and oaths leaped to the others&#39; mouths. Orr held up his hand.\n\n&quot;One of you injected cholera germs in those two monkeys. The idea was to make it look as though they&#39;d bitten him and given him cholera. The thing backfired. Nelson died from cholera all right, but he didn&#39;t get it from a monkey bite. One of you slipped him the disease, in a very clever but simple way.\n\n&quot;Being kind of old and having been given a large dosage, the infection was extremely severe.&quot; Orr&#39;s tone took on a harder vibrancy. &quot;He died before he could help himself or before he could get help!&quot;\n\n&quot;You — you can prove all that?&quot; Vic Culler stammered.\n\n&quot;Yes. Tonight the killer came back. He&#39;s somehow or other found out where the cholera formula was. But when he got his hands on it, he found it was locked to waterpipes. I know who that man is.&quot;\n\nSpight eyed Torgerson and Culler suspiciously. &quot;Who is it?&quot; he asked.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s you,&quot; Orr barked. &quot;Culler&#39;s killing the monkeys wrecked your scheme; they wouldn&#39;t have showed postmortem signs of cholera. So you told him to burn &#39;em. They wouldn&#39;t have showed signs anyway; they&#39;d been immunized. You didn&#39;t  —  Take him, sheriff!&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nThe Wine\n\nAt those startling words, Spight had moved back, then darted toward the dark. But one of the sheriff&#39;s two men, surprisingly fleet-footed, tripped him. Snarling, he tried to fight back. He was quickly handcuffed.\n\n&quot;I — I don&#39;t have anything to do with this,&quot; Torgerson wheezed.\n\n&quot;No, I don&#39;t think you do,&quot; Orr said. &quot;He worked at it alone. He wanted to hog the formula for himself.&quot;\n\nSpight babbled out a curse. &quot;You can&#39;t prove anything.&quot;\n\nOrr pulled out a carefully wrapped bottle.\n\n&quot;Wine,&quot; he said. &quot;This was in your room.&quot; He smiled at Torgerson. &quot;I took the liberty of checking this with your microscope. Doc. The wine&#39;s loaded with cholera germs!&quot;\n\n&quot;Why, yes!&quot; Torgerson cried at Spight. &quot;You did give him a drink of that yesterday. He was pretty tired, and you said that would pep him up. It killed him instead, eh?&quot;\n\n&quot;And he&#39;s the man that tried to dig out the formula from the side of the house,&quot; Orr said. &quot;A check-up of his fingernails will show the dirt under &#39;em matches that alongside the house.&quot;\n\nSpight cursed savagely, jeered: &quot;Yeah, Yeah, you got me all right. Don&#39;t rub it in. But if it hadn&#39;t been for you, wise guy, these other punks wouldn&#39;t have figured it.&quot;\n\nThe sheriff jerked him away angrily. &quot;We got it figured now,&quot; he growled.\n\nAlone with Catherine and Torgerson later, Orr said: &quot;About Nelson&#39;s share on this formula — I think we&#39;d better turn it over to some hospital for research purposes.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good idea,&quot; Torgerson agreed. &quot;He would have probably done that himself.&quot;\n\nCatherine slipped her arm under her husband&#39;s. She said, &quot;Darling, I still can&#39;t understand how you tagged Spight.&quot;\n\n&quot;Those wirelike impressions on the dirt around that hole he dug,&quot; Orr explained. &quot;Only one thing could have done that — corduroy pants. I noticed that&#39;s what Spight was wearing this afternoon. In his hurry to get his fingers on the formula, he knelt in several spots. He left knee marks. The fool tagged himself!&quot;\n\n~ The End ~ \n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  An Almost Exact Parallel\n  $1,000,000 Gambling Concession\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nAn Almost Exact Parallel\n\nAmong the many unsolved mysteries in American crime annals the strange disappearance case of millionaire William Long, of Denver and Chicago, stands out as unusually weird. The case is doubly interesting in that it is marked by an almost exact parallel in the disappearance of millionaire William Sweet of Montreal. In each case a million dollars in cash disappeared with the victim.\n\nSo far as is known the two cases are in no way connected. It is barely possible that the same combination of kidnappers and murderers perpetrated both crimes — if they were crimes. It is not altogether impossible that both men disappeared of their own volition, although such deductions might seem highly improbable. The William Long case is the most interesting so it will be held for more detailed treatment while a brief review is given of the William Sweet case which is the more recent of the two.\n\nWilliam Sweet dropped from visible earthly existence in a Montreal office building a few minutes after he had been paid $1,000,000 in cash for his holdings in a Canadian theater chain. He had insisted the deal be for cash and the amount paid to him in his offices. The purchasers —  according to perfectly reliable witnesses  —  brought the money to William Sweet&#39;s offices where they found him alone in an inner room. They paid over the money, were handed the documents of conveyance in return, and left the place. That was some twenty years ago and from that moment to now no one has ever seen or heard of William Sweet or the million dollars in cash.\n\nHis attorneys, nor anyone connected with him closely, could account for his strange actions prior to his disappearance. He was estranged from his wife. She and others were questioned long and arduously by police without result. His friends were the most mystified of all.\n\nA few years previously William Long, one of the oddest characters ever to have existed outside the pages of fiction, dropped from sight on the street in the Loop district in Chicago in mid-afternoon. He was carrying a suitcase containing $1,000,000 in cash which he had just withdrawn from a Chicago bank. He was on his way to pay the money to the heads of a syndicate in control of Chicago&#39;s gambling concession. The money was to purchase for him a controlling interest in an illegal concession and one that would not have been regarded as tangible, probably, by any man in the world except a Western gambler.\n\nFurthermore, in order to get the million dollars with which to purchase control of Chicago&#39;s gambling institutions Long had sacrificed a perfectly legitimate and highly prosperous produce commission business. Always a gambler, Long had tumbled into the legitimate million-dollar business accidentally. He had entered into it against his better or personal judgment and had no liking for it whatever. It interfered with Long&#39;s gambling career, a situation which —  to a man of Long&#39;s type — was altogether intolerable.\n\nWestern gamblers are legion — a reckless, money-plunging, romantic and venturesome yet an admittedly square-shooting clan. Long was typical of this crowd. He was a swagger dresser and more marked than many because he was strikingly handsome. Even better looking was Long&#39;s red-haired wife. They were an unusually devoted pair according to all reports.\n\nLong was born in Chicago and even as a young man he managed to climb high in the gambling circles of that city. He was a high-ranking officer in the fabulous gambling empire of John Worth, reputed to have been the wealthiest gambler of all time with the possible exceptions of Edward Chase and Vasil Chuckovich. Chase and Chuck, as they were known, controlled all gambling from Chicago west to the coast for thirty years and amassed more than $20,000,000 apiece. Canfield, in all his glory, nor any other Eastern gambler, not even the present wealthy, staid, and conservative Col. Bradley, king of the modern gambling world, ever approached the enormous fortunes of Worth, or Chase or Chuck.\n\nChase was originally a Saratoga, N. Y., hotel clerk and his partner Chuck was an Austrian emigrant, kitchen worker. Both were bitten by the gambling bug in Saratoga and went West, not to grow up with, but to fairly conquer the country. They ran a dime apiece up into multi-millions without batting their eye-lashes. It was under the direction of this highly spectacular paid that William Long, a gambling genius in his own right, was destined to work in Denver.\n\nLong left Chicago for Denver during one of those periodical municipal reform up-heavals that sent his boss, John Worth, under cover for a spell. Long arrived in Denver with his beautiful wife and a $10,000 bank roll one bright spring day at the opening of the Overland Park racing season. The Colorado resort fairly dripped with wealthy tourists and members of the sporting fraternity from everywhere. He qualified with Boss Ed Chase and was assigned territory. He opened up a rather modest gambling hall near Seventeenth and Curtis streets. This was within a stone&#39;s throw of Chase and Chuck&#39;s famous Cottage Club and it was understood that Long was to take care of the overflow from the Cottage resort.\n\nJust to bow to a time-honored custom, the room of Long&#39;s place fronting on the street was fitted up as a fruit stand — a stall, of course, for the spacious gambling hall in the back. This was more a condescension to the church element than through any fear of the law.\n\nLong had been in operation only a few weeks when the altogether weird began entering into his affairs. The Rocky Ford garden district in Colorado began growing small melons. Some of them found their way to Long&#39;s stall. A youth tended the stall and nobody connected with the whole establishment ever cared whether the fruit stall ever profited a dime or not. The youth knew his salary was coming from the games in back but it was customary to treat any possible stray customer for fruit quite seriously and attentively.\n\nOne afternoon Long sent the youth on an errand and took charge of the stall while the boy was gone. This was simply because all Long&#39;s dealers were doing a Monte Carlo business in back and he was the only one footloose. A man approached the stall and picked up one of the tiny cantaloupes from Rocky Ford. He cut into it with a pocket-knife and tasted the meat. Then the customer&#39;s eye-lids went up in the air. Long observed him and, as he explained later, was becoming just a little bored. Then the customer spoke, gravely, seriously:\n\n&quot;This,&quot; he said, &quot;is the most perfect and the most deliciously flavored melon of its kind in all the world.&quot;\n\n&quot;If that&#39;s true,&quot; said Long, &quot;nobody seems to care. I can get them at a dime apiece, wholesale. I&#39;ll sell you all you can carry at fifteen cents each.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where do you get them?&quot; asked the customer.\n\n&quot;They&#39;re grown down in Rocky Ford,&quot; said Long.\n\n&quot;These melons are worth $1.50 each and I can get that for them. I&#39;ll take a trainload, laid down in Chicago, green, at fifteen cents each. I am Mr. Blank of Blank &amp;amp; Blank. We supply a wealthy trade, the most excellent hotels and the royal families of Europe. Wire me the market daily on these melons in season.&quot;\n\n&amp;lt;h6 class=“btt”&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=“#top”&amp;gt;Back to Top&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h6&amp;gt;\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n$1,000,000 Gambling Concession\n\nThat was the beginning of the Rocky Ford cantaloupe fame. Prices soared to seventy-five cents, wholesale, within a week. Long went into the melon business with Senator Swink, of the Rocky Ford district. They bought up the entire crop and cleaned up a million dollars profit each within a few years.\n\nThen Long became restive. The gambling germs in his blood were rampant. He sold out to Senator Swink and others and moved on to Chicago, his early stamping ground.\n\nWorth, kingpin of the Chicago gambling fraternity, had grown old and what is known as the &quot;concession&quot; had fallen into other hands. Long found that, so far as the Chicago gambling situation was concerned, he was an outsider looking in. He and his wife knew that even their old friends could do nothing to change this situation.\n\nBut our hero was nothing if not a determined person. Both he and his beautiful red-haired wife liked Chicago and Long could not live without gambling, so he was put to figuring out some way to make it possible for him to fly his flags in the Loop or some other first-class commercial district.\n\nFinally he decided that if he could gain a foothold no other way, no one would try to prevent his buying his way in. So he made his famous offer of $1,000,000 cash for a controlling interest in one approved district. What happened after that might never be thoroughly understood. A little light is thrown on the shadow by some known facts regarding Chicago gamblers and their wars.\n\nLike Long, himself, all Chicago gamblers are determined persons. The famous killing of Jake Lingel and other interesting little events only go to show just how determined Chicago gamblers are at times. It is possible that there was an element in Chicago that did not exactly approve of Long&#39;s activities. It is possible that they objected to his entrance into the lists at any price.\n\nWhat can happen under such conditions is shown by a page from the record which reveals that, some years back, one gambling contingent was in and another contingent was out. The outs were warring with the ins. During this one war 49 bombs were tossed and planted and 49 gambling establishments were blasted, uprooted and blown into the air.\n\nThere is no doubt that Long was aware of conditions. Whatever it was that happened to him he certainly must have walked into it with his eyes wide open.\n\nHis deal to pay $1,000,000 cash for a gambling concession progressed to a point where Long withdrew the money from a bank. He took it to his hotel room where he waited with his wife for a telephone call. The money was in a suitcase. The phone rang and according to the wife Long answered it. It was a little after one o&#39;clock in the afternoon — broad daylight, of course.\n\nLong turned from the phone to his wife.\n\n&quot;I am going over now, and meet the boys,&quot; he said. &quot;I have only got to go about two blocks and as soon as I sign up I will be right back.&quot;\n\n&quot;For God&#39;s sake be careful,&quot; cautioned the wife.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t be silly,&quot; laughed Long. &quot;It is broad daylight. I am only going a couple of blocks along the busiest street in the world. This suitcase will attract no more attention than any other suitcase.&quot; Long kissed his wife and left. He was confident and cheerful. But he did not come back.\n\nThe beautiful wife waited and waited. She phoned all their friends and all the hospitals.\n\nGamblers&#39; wives are never in a hurry to phone the police but finally, after many hours of waiting and weeping, Mrs. Long did just that. It availed her nothing. To use a hackneyed figure, it was as though the earth had opened and swallowed her husband.\n\n~ The End ~\n\n"

Without the ultra modern bathroom background, she might have been some shy nymph poised beside a pool in a hidden forest glade.\n\n“Hold it, now!” Reece said with quiet urgency from where he stood beside the big camera. He watched her tensely, conscious that the shutter release bulb was dangerously slippery in his hand. It was stiflingly hot in the studio, and Reece had already taken three shots of the girl, rearranging the lights and setting each time in the effort to be certain that he got one picture which would be exactly right.\n\nLeila Nesbitt held the pose, though with an evidence of strain, fortunately concealed by the shadows, which showed that she had still to gain the statue-like immobility necessary in a professional photographer’s model. Reece hesitated a moment in the act of squeezing the shutter release bulb, looking at her. He felt the strange feeling of aching tightness well up into his throat. He’d taken pictures of scores of beautiful women, but be couldn’t recall having felt this way before. This was the first time any girl had ever been more than a common object of photographic composition, a mere problem in lights and shadows, and he was afraid. Afraid because what he felt was so new and rare he could not bear the thought of disappointment.\n\nReece swallowed hard and pressed the bulb. “That’s all,” he told Leila.\n\nThe girl slipped at once into the comparative darkness to one side of the softly floodlighted bathroom scene and began quickly to pull on a more substantial robe. Reece was careful not to watch her. He busied himself with the camera, sharply aware of the small rustling sounds she made.\n\nHe liked her shyness, her natural unspoiled modesty. It was this, even more than her refreshing vivacious beauty, which had attracted him, for it had set her apart from the women he knew. Photographer’s models usually become quite unconcerned and base after a time about displaying their physical charms, and in this respect Reece found Leila different. She was a newcomer to the modelling game. He had met her a little over a month before, a short time after she had arrived in the city, looking for work. Fascinated at once by the novelty of her reserve, Reece had hired her. And all too soon he had found himself thinking in terms of wedding rings and apartments for two.\n\n“Do you think the pictures will turn out all right, Floyd?” Leila asked anxiously as Reece turned off the floodlights. She was barefooted, looking almost child-like in the long green robe. Her chestnut hair, the hue of polished mahogany, had been piled atop her small head for the picture, and now she began deftly to rearrange it, searching Reece’s face questioningly.\n\nReece flashed her a grin of reassurance. “Don’t worry, Leila. With you in them, the pictures are certain to be perfect.”\n\n“I didn’t mean that,” Leila said quickly, her delicate features reddening. “I was thinking about Mr. Kendall. You know how important these pictures are to him.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nVengeful Determination\n\nReece glanced at the girl sharply, feeling a sudden wrench of dismay. He wondered why she should be so concerned about Jerry Kendall. Could it be that she was interested in him? Reece went cold at the thought. He had not considered Kendall as a rival, but now the possibility came to him with the shock of an electric current.\n\nHe said slowly, “The pictures are important to me, too, Leila. Jerry Kendall and I are running this advertising agency on a partnership basis, with Jerry taking care of the business end while I handle the artwork. We’re both in the same boat. Naturally, I’m hoping the pictures turn out well. Getting that contract from the Dahlia Cosmetic Company would establish us among the big firms and bring in more business.”\n\nLeila smiled ruefully. “You look too much like an artist, Floyd. I keep forgetting that you’re a businessman, too.”\n\nUnintentionally, the girl had touched Reece in a sensitive spot. To hide the sudden bitterness which twisted his face, he turned quickly to a nearby table and picked up the photographic plates which he had just exposed. He resented his appearance—a resentment which had grown entirely out of his association with Kendall.\n\nShort and thin and with a sedentary pallor, Reece was all too aware that he cut a poor figure beside Kendall, who was tall and athletic. He did not like to have the contrast referred to, no matter how indirectly, and coming from Leila, the hurt was especially keen.\n\n“Are you going to develop the pictures yourself, Floyd?” Leila asked, indicating the plates.\n\nForcing an expression of calmness, Reece nodded. “This is a rush job, and with everything depending on the results. I wouldn’t care to trust any of the assistants with them.”\n\n“I’m going to get dressed, then,” Leila said. She smiled at Reece and started toward the dressing room adjoining the studio.\n\n“Oh, just a minute, Leila!” Reece called.\n\n“Yes?” She turned back to him questioningly.\n\n“I … I hope you won’t think I’m rushing matters, but I’d like to know if I could take you out again tonight.”\n\n“I’m sorry, Floyd. Mr. Kendall has already asked me.”\n\nReece had an abruptly sick feeling. “Jerry? You … you’re going out with Jerry?”\n\nLeila stared at Reece wonderingly. As though frightened by what she saw in his face, she turned quickly away.\n\nFor some seconds, Reece stood there as though in a daze. Finally he roused himself into motion, started leadenly toward the darkroom. He walked as though through the shards of broken hopes. He knew that there was no longer any hope for him, if Jerry Kendall were interested in Leila. His envy of Kendall suddenly became cold relentless hatred.\n\nIn the darkroom, going mechanically through the process of developing the plates, Reece found himself toying with the though of murder. If Kendall were out of the way, he would have a clear field where Leila was concerned. And the agency would belong to him entirely. Kendall had organized and advanced it to the point where Reece felt he could easily carry on.\n\nBut the stumbling block in Kendall’s elimination was how to do it safely. Reece knew he had to avoid suspicion not only from the police, but from Leila also. Especially from Leila, since the girl had already guessed his feelings. With vengeful determination, Reece began to ponder ways and means.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nChocked Back Anger\n\nJerry Kendall was in his office, talking to Leila, when Reece entered with the finished prints. Kendall rose eagerly to his feet.\n\n“How did the pictures turn out, Floyd?”\n\nReece had already decided on the attitude he would assume for the duration of his relations with Kendall—relations to be terminated as soon as a foolproof plan for murder presented itself. He would be completely friendly and ingratiating, as though nothing at all were going to happen. Now he grinned with an expression of exaggerated boasting and waved a hand of which the thumb and forefinger formed a circle, the remaining three fingers stiffly erect.\n\nKendall seized the pictures impatiently and spread them out on his desk. He and Leila scrutinized them with exclamations of delight.\n\n“They’re great!” Kendall said. “You did a swell job, Floyd. As soon as the copy is ready, we’ll ship the layout to the Dahlia Cosmetics people. The pictures alone are sure to win us the contract?”\n\nSliding the pictures together, Kendall placed them carefully in his desk. “This calls for a celebration. Get your coat on, Floyd, and we’ll all go downstairs for a few drinks.”\n\n“Right with you!”\n\nReece assented lightly. He was relieved to see Leila’s face clear up at his ready acceptance of the invitation. He knew she had dismissed as unimportant his chagrin earlier at the news that she was going out with Kendall. Soon she would forget about it entirely. Thus when Kendall died, she would have no reason to suspect Reece.\n\nSlipping into his coat, Reece rejoined Leila and Kendall, and together they rode the elevator down to the combination restaurant and cocktail lounge on the main floor of the building. Kendall’s elation at the certainty of the deal with the cosmetic company filled him with small-boy mischief. He pointed at Reece teasingly.\n\n“Look at that coat, Leila. Have you ever seen anything like it? Why, it’s stuffed more full of junk than a kid’s pockets. Floyd is a regular perambulating junk shop!”\n\nReece chuckled good-naturally, though inwardly he ached with rage. “Going through trash cans is an old habit of mine,” he returned easily. “I manage to pick up a few things here and there. Every little bit helps, business being the way it is.”\n\nKendall and Leila laughed appreciatively. Leila said, sobering:\n\n“I’ve often noticed the way your pockets bulge, Floyd. Just what do you carry in them anyway?”\n\n“Photographic equipment, mostly. A miniature camera, spare film, photometers, reference books, and things like that. Good pictures are all around you, and it pays to be prepared.”\n\nKendall slapped Reece’s back.\n\n“That’s the proper attitude, Floyd. But going around in a coat with so many suspicious bulges, I should think you’d scare the pictures away.”\n\nReece choked back his anger, keeping the smile fixed rigidly on his face. He was painfully aware that Kendall was making him look like a fool—and in front of Leila. His determination to kill Kendall became a thing of burning intensity.\n\nIn the cocktail lounge, they found a table and ordered drinks. Kendall exuberantly proposed a toast.\n\n“Here’s to Dahlia Cosmetics. May their lipstick never smear and their mascara never run!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Certain Miniature\n\nThey laughed and drank. Kendall began to discuss plans for expansion of the agency as if the Dahlia Cosmetic contract was a foregone conclusion. Reece forced a pretense of interest, fuming as he noticed how Leila hung on Kendall’s every word.\n\nReece was pleased when Dominick Vallo appeared beside the table. The presence of the moody Italian art dealer would serve excellently to divert Leila’s attention from Kendall.\n\n“Ah, my friends, how are you?” Vallo greeted effusively. He seemed to have had a few drinks too many.\n\nAs always, his expensively tailored suit was wrinkled and mussed. His great shock of curly black hair, streaked with white, stood on end as though from repeated nervous combing with his fingers. He had sad liquid eyes and a long melancholy face.\n\nReece knew Vallo quite well, as did Kendall also, since Vallo’s art gallery and curio shop was on the same floor as the agency offices. Leila had already met him, having been introduced by Reece a few weeks before.\n\nAt Reece’s gesture of invitation, Vallo pulled up a chair and sat down. He proceeded at once to fix Leila with a devouring gaze.\n\n“Madonna!” he exclaimed at last. “It cannot be, but my eyes, they do not lie. Each time I look at you, Signorina, I am reminded of a certain miniature in my collection.”\n\n“You’ve mentioned that before,” Leila said. “Just what is this certain miniature you’re always talking about?”\n\nVallo leaned toward her confidingly, but watching him, Reece thought he detected in the other’s attitude a strange hint of contradiction. Vallo’s eyes, for some reason, seemed to become lidded, guarded, as though he were hiding as much as what he intended to reveal.\n\n“The miniature is a little painted portrait, just so big.” Vallo held out a thumb and a forefinger, separated by a space of some two inches. “It was made in Venice around the time of the Borgia’s. It is old, very old, and valuable. But most important, Signorina, the face of the girl in the miniature is almost the same as your own!”\n\nVallo leaned forward still further, to the amusement of Reece and Kendall and the dismay of Leila. “Ah, you must see this miniature, Signorina. I will show you other things. Famous paintings—”\n\nKendall chuckled. “Come up and see my etchings, said the spider to the fly.”\n\nVallo drew back with an injured expression. “What! You suggest that I, Dominick Vallo, might have what you call dishonorable intentions? It is an insult!”\n\nVallo promptly forgot his honor as a bar hostess appeared with a tray of drinks. He buried his long nose in a glass eagerly. When he finally set it down, his mournful expression had returned.\n\n“Ah, no, the Vallo’s have long been known as men of integrity and virtue. The little Signorina would be quite safe in my hands. Why … why, gladly would I lay down my life to protect her! There is nothing I would not do. She has only to say the word, and I would gladly end my life.”\n\nVallo thumped the table and looked at Leila with a kind of mournful determination.\n\n“Don’t believe him,” Kendall told • the girl. “Dominick tells that to all the ladies. In fact, lie has quite a reputation around here as a potential suicide. The only reason why he isn’t dead already is because he always passes out from too much bottled courage before he can commit the bloody deed.”\n\n“Ah, but this time it is different,” Vallo insisted. He seemed determined that Leila should not take his threat lightly. “This time I mean it. Long I have been in love with the girl in the miniature. And now to find her in the flesh, alive …”\n\nVallo released a doleful sigh.\n\n“Ah, if I were only young again; But, Signorina, perhaps you do not mind?” Vallo asked, leaning suddenly toward Leila again. “Meglio tardi che mat. Better late than never, eh?”\n\nShe drew back, startled, then laughed. “I think you’re very nice, Mr. Vallo. But if you don’t mind, I’d rather have a boy friend my age.”\n\nVallo shook his head bitterly. “So it must be il campo santo—the cemetery —after all.”\n\nKendall glanced at his watch and stood up. “We’d better be going, Leila, if we’re to have enough time to climb into our formals.”\n\nShe nodded quickly and picked up her purse and gloves. Reece seethed at her evident eagerness. He managed an airy wave of the hand as she and Kendall left. Reece was almost glad to have them go. If they had remained another minute, he felt as though he’d have burst with the volcanic fury inside him.\n\nReece remained for a while at the table with Vallo. The mournful-looking art dealer kept exclaiming at intervals over the marvel of Leila’s resemblance to the lady in the miniature. Reece was only dimly aware of what Vallo was saying. He was grappling once more with the problem of his intended murder of Kendall.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nPlan For Murder\n\nA week passed. The Dahlia Cosmetic Company approved of the pictures and layout, and the contract was duly signed. Reece found himself suddenly overwhelmed with an influx of new business. He saw little or nothing of Leila, but from occasional remarks dropped by Kendall, he knew Kendall was seeing the girl frequently—all too frequently.\n\nReece’s problem was still unsolved. No safe plan for murder had yet suggested itself. And with the element of time now introduced by the growing intimacy between Kendall and Leila, the whole thing was beginning to look hopeless.\n\nDuring a lull in his work, one afternoon, Reece seized the opportunity to visit the cocktail lounge on the main floor of the building. He had, in fact, became of late a steady customer.\n\nDominick Vallo was seated at one of the tables, staring moodily into the depths of an old fashioned. Reece joined the other and signalled the bar hostess.\n\n“You have heard the news?” Vallo asked.\n\nReece shook his head. “What do you mean?”\n\n“Jerry Kendall has not told you?”\n\n“I haven’t seen much of him lately—- or of anyone, for that matter,” Reece said bitterly.\n\n“The beautiful Leila, she is going to marry,” Vallo explained.\n\nReece’s heart climbed a mountain and jumped off. “Marry!” he gasped.\n\nVallo nodded solemnly. “Jerry was in a great hurry, but he told me this. Just a few minutes ago. He went upstairs to look for you.”\n\n“I must have gone down just as he came up,” Reece decided dully. Abruptly he stood up. “I don’t want to see him. Come on, let’s go. There’s another bar around the corner.” Reece tossed a bill on the table to pay for the drinks, as yet unarrived, and grasping a reluctant Vallo by the arm, hastily left.\n\nIn the other taproom, Reece and Vallo settled down to serious drinking. The alcohol was a key that unlocked the door of Reece’s reserve. He began pouring out to Vallo the story of his hopes and frustrations. Highly emotional by nature, Vallo’s usual melancholy deepened to a boundless sympathy for Reece.\n\n“That Jerry Kendall, he is a rat!” Vallo declared thickly. He hunched toward Reece secretively. “My friend, what you need in this crisis is one of the little toys the Italians like the Borgia’s used long ago. Clever little gadgets—like the miniature.”\n\n“The miniature?” Reece grunted. “What’s the miniature got to do with helping me?”\n\nVallo leaned forward closer, and his voice dropped to a hoarse whisper.\n\n“The miniature was made small to be worn close to one’s heart. Not your heart, my friend, but the heart of your enemy. For inside the miniature is a device which throws out a poisoned needle when the heat of the body melts a little wax stop. A nice gift, no? Your enemy wears it close to his heart, and—phf-f-t!. No more enemy.”\n\nSomething clicked in Reece’s mind, like the pieces of a long, perplexing puzzle falling finally together. A ray of cunning penetrated the alcoholic fog which filled him. He told Vallo, “It’s impossible. I don’t believe a word of it. Such a thing just can’t be done.”\n\nVallo’s back became stiffly perpendicular. “Impossible, eh? Well, I’ll show you the miniature! You shall see for yourself.”\n\n“Ail right, but you’re going to have a hard time convincing me.” Reece rose in belligerent acceptance of the other’s challenge. This was exactly what he had been hoping for. Vallo had played right into his hands.\n\nThe fog inside Reece was swiftly evaporating. He glanced at his watch. It was almost evening, which meant that most of the tenants of Reece’s and Vallo’s office building would be gone. This suited Reece fine, since it meant that there was now little chance of his running into Kendall.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nIt Is Not Loaded\n\nOnly one elevator operator was now on duty in the building and his cage was rising to the upper floors. Fuming at Reece’s irritating disbelief, Vallo plunged up the stairs. With a shrug, Reece followed. They met nobody on the way to their floor. The hall itself was empty.\n\nMuttering hotly under his breath, Vallo fumblingly fitted his key in the lock and led the way into his shop. From a drawer of the old-fashioned roll-top desk in his office, he pulled a Small flat metal box.\n\n“Here it is!” he announced triumphantly. “Now I shall show you.”\n\nVallo opened the box and into the palm of his hand shook a tiny framed painting which looked curiously thick.\n\n“Handle it carefully,” he warned as Reece impulsively reached for it. “The last owner of the miniature kept poison on the needle, and it is still deadly.”\n\nReece gazed at the miniature with fascinated interest. The painting was of a young girl. The resemblance to Leila seemed slight at first, but strangely the longer Reece looked at the painting, the closer the similarity became. He realized finally that the alikeness was due more to spiritual than physical characteristics. The girl in the miniature had the same quality of demure shyness as Leila.\n\n“But where is the needle?” Reece asked Vallo.\n\n“It is inside,” the other explained. He pointed to a barely discernible spot on the surface of the painting. “See? She wears a red dress. This is red wax, covering the hole where the needle comes out. It is hard to tell the difference, no?”\n\nReece nodded slowly, his thoughts scurrying like hungry mice. “You wouldn’t know it was there unless you looked for it.” Reece abruptly grasped Vallo’s arm, and his eyes narrowed.\n\n“Listen, Dominick, you agreed that Kendall played us a dirty trick by taking Leila away from us like that. Are we going to let him get away with it? No, we won’t! I’ll tell you what we’ll do. We’ll send him the miniature for a wedding present—tell him to wear it close to his heart. There’s our revenge, Dominick. How’s that?”\n\n“Madonna, no!” Vallo snatched the miniature from Reece’s hand. “The little Leila, she knows. She will tell the police who sent the miniature. I will go to jail.”\n\n“That’s right, of course,” Reece muttered. He bit his lip, frowning thoughtfully. In his mind, the completed puzzle shifted, rearranged itself, clicked into place. Exultation coursed through him like the glow of vintage wine. His plans had changed a little. But now they were perfect—utterly foolproof. He was going to murder Kendall—and get away with it beyond any slightest suspicion from either Leila or the police.\n\nReece had earlier noticed a brace of antique duelling pistols on the wall over Vallo’s desk. Now he pointed to them, pretending a sudden interest.\n\n“Say, Dominick, do those old guns work?”\n\n“Work? Certainly! They are genuine, these, and not just for show.” Vallo placed the miniature on his desk and took down one of the pistols.\n\nReece drew back in mock alarm. “Careful with that thing, Dominick!”\n\n“Don’t worry, it is not loaded.”\n\n“But can you load it, Dominick?” “Sure. I have powder and shot in the case that goes with the pistols. I know the method.”\n\n“Let’s load it, then,” Reese suggested in sudden eagerness.\n\nVallo shook his head dubiously. “It is too much trouble.”\n\n“Come on, Dominick, we’ll have some fun.”\n\n“No, it would be just a waste.\n\nReece gauged the other’s state of inebriety carefully. He decided to try a ruse which had worked successfully once before.\n\n“I don’t believe that gun will work, Dominick. You’re just trying to impress me.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nThe Package\n\nAs before, Vallo bit. His dark eyes lighted with indignation.\n\n“Again you refuse to believe,” he accused. “All right, all right, I shall load it. You shall see for yourself.”\n\nHe sat down at the desk, removing from one of the drawers a large leather- covered case. It was lined with red velvet inside. There were depressions for the pistols, and compartments which held powder, shot, and wadding. With quick though unsteady hands, Vallo loaded the weapon. When he had finished, Vallo extended the pistol with a flourish to Reece.\n\n“There! Now it is loaded.” He carelessly indicated an old leather couch across the room which was covered with pillows. “Go ahead, prove it for me. I have loaded the gun so that there will not be much noise.”\n\nWith a smile of anticipated triumph, Vallo produced a half-filled bottle of whiskey from the desk and drank deeply. Putting the bottle down, he swiveled in his chair to watch the couch.\n\nReece’s lips thinned in a hard grin. He placed the muzzle of the pistol against Vallo’s right temple, and before the other could realize what was going to happen, he pulled the trigger. There was a dull muffled roar. Vallo slumped limply in the chair.\n\nReece felt as though on fire with elation. The set-up was beautiful—just beautiful. In his mind’s eye, he could visualize just the way it would look to the police, to everyone. Grief-stricken at the news that Leila was going to be married, Vallo had committed suicide. The art dealer’s brooding melancholy temperament, and the numerous threats which he had made to kill himself would support the theory.\n\nThis, however, was just a part of Reece’s plan. He chuckled with satisfaction as he rounded out the rest of it. Forging Vallo’s hand-writing, he intended to send the miniature to Kendall, with the explanation that it was a wedding present, and the sentimental request that Kendall wear it close to his heart. The job of forgery need not be done with exactness, since any noticeable differences would be explained on the basis that the writing had been done while Vallo was drunk.\n\nSince the miniature bore a resemblance to Leila, Kendall would carry it around as a keepsake. The needle would do its lethal work—and Reece would have a clear road both with Leila and the agency, with nobody the wiser. Kendall’s death would be accepted as due to an act of revenge on the part of Vallo.\n\nReece got to work. Wiping the pistol clean of his fingerprints he placed it in Vallo’s hand. Then he assembled all the necessary materials—pen, ink, twine, writing and wrapping paper, and various records from which to copy Vallo’s handwriting.\n\nHe first wrapped the miniature carefully and addressed it to Kendall. That done, he wrote a short note, explaining the miniature as a wedding gift and adding the request that Kendall wear it close to his heart. With stamps he found in one of the desk drawers, Reece finally had the package and note ready for mailing.\n\nHe departed by way of the stairs, leaving the lobby of the building only when he was sure he would not be noticed. The package and its accompanying note he dropped in a mailbox on the corner.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nA Sudden Sharp Pain\n\nThat night—and for a good part of the next morning—Reece celebrated what he felt certain was the complete solution of his problems. How he managed to reach his apartment afterward was a mystery which he couldn’t explain. When he awoke, it was early afternoon. Feeling too sick to go down to the agency, he remained in bed.\n\nOn his way to work, the following day, Reece collided with the mailman. His bus was due to arrive within a few minutes, and he was anxious not to miss it.\n\n“A registered for you,” the mailman called out, as Reece muttered hasty apologies and started once more for the door.\n\nIt was a thick envelope. Reece signed hurriedly and dashed for the bus stop. His coat pockets were filled as usual. After a futile search for space, Reece stuffed the envelope into the pocket of his shirt.\n\nAt the agency, Reece found matters proceeding as though nothing had happened. The Vallo part of his plan had gone through without complications, as he had learned from a garrulous elevator operator. Vallo’s body had been discovered by an assistant, and the police had dismissed the art dealer’s death as suicide—just as Reece had intended they should.\n\nThe only remaining uncertainty was Kendall. Something which gave Reece hope was the significant fact that Kendall was not in his office. Reece knew Kendall was always the first person to arrive at the downtown agency in the morning.\n\nEntering his own office, Reece found a letter on his desk. He tensed with sudden alarm as he recognized Kendall’s handwriting. Reece tore the letter open quickly, his thoughts spinning in wondering anxiety.\n\nDear Floyd:\n\nWrote you two letters, sending one to the agency and one to your apartment so there wouldn’t be any delay. Was called out of town on business which I’ll explain fully when I get back. That Dahlia Cosmetics deal has been bringing in customers!\n\nVallo sent me as a wedding present that miniature he was always talking about. I’m not keeping it, as it isn’t me Leila’s going to marry, but a fellow she’d been engaged to and quarreled with, which was why she came to the city. The guy came after her, and they made up.\n\nI was in a hurry that afternoon— this business had popped up—and Vallo must have misunderstood me.\n\nI know how you felt about Leila, and so I’m sending you the miniature. I’m not sentimental enough—\n\nThere were just a few lines more, but Reece abruptly stopped reading. With a thrill of unutterable horror, he recalled the registered envelope which had arrived as he was hurrying from his apartment. The bulky envelope which he had stuffed—of all places— in his shirt pocket … over his heart!\n\nFear flashing and roaring inside him, Reece frantically reached to tear the envelope away. He was too late. He knew it as he felt a sudden sharp pain over his heart—in his heart. He tried to scream in terror and frustration, but the poison acted before he could get his paralyzed throat muscles to operate. Blackness closed in around him— the ultimate blackness of death.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

He hung to a strap in complete oblivion of his surroundings, for his mind was busy with the “trick” he was planning.\n\nMazie had been loitering in the vicinity of the wholesale silk house for the last two weeks. On the following evening she would be ready to report. At that time she would give him a complete description of the location, together with a floor-plan of the building, showing all entrances and exits. Then, there remained the selection of the men he would use, and hiring the trucks to carry away the loot, and making arrangements for selling the silk.\n\nGarbett was an executive. He planned crimes as business men plan advertising or selling campaigns, and with equal skill and intelligence. Not once during his long career had he ventured upon an undertaking without first making careful and thorough investigations. Quick to take advantage of every opportunity, he nevertheless had a code of ethics. He preferred to scheme and plan rather than to wait for a lucky chance. And he had the skilled worker’s justifiable contempt for blunderings and amateurish crudities.\n\nAs he stepped from the shuttle train and hurried through the underground tunnel that crawls under Broadway, his mind was busy. Nothing must be left to Fate, every possibility must be anticipated. For half of his thirty-four years he had been in active conflict with law and order. Consequently, even in his moments of concentration he was unconsciously alert.\n\nA portly, white-haired gentleman, moving with the dignity demanded by his weight and build, was walking a short distance before Garbett. A thin clerk, sprinting for a train, collided with Peter Riddick, and raced on without apology. A bobbed, trim stenographer, after completing her toilette with the aid of a pocket mirror, jolted the white-haired gentleman. And Peter Riddick’s long, flat, leather wallet, disturbed from its repose in his hip pocket, fell to the grimy floor.\n\nTemptation reared its tempting head within the crook’s mind. Unaware of his loss, Peter Riddick continued upon his peaceful though buffeted way. Garbett stopped and picked up the purse.\n\nThe thunderous roar of racing subway trains, the voices of bellowing subway guards as they called the name of the station, the conversations and shuffling feet of hundreds of subway dwellers, mingled and blended, sounding like the murmurous roar of angry surf breaking upon a rocky shore. Garbett stared at the purse a second, and then he smiled scornfully at the voice of Temptation. He had not acquired this purse and contents in a legitimate and honorable way. Neither had he secured it through his own skill or cunning. Anyone, irrespective of their intelligence or ability, might have found it.\n\nGarbett had worked in crowds before when he had been serving under an instructor in pocket-picking. Therefore, he knew how to avoid unwelcome collisions, how to weave his way through tightly packed humanity. He squirmed his way through the flowing masses of people like a drop of water sliding down greased glass.\n\nPeter Riddick turned at the firm touch on his arm and observed the young man who had stopped him. He saw a keen-eyed man, nervously assured in manner, who wore an inconspicuous blue serge suit, a soft brown felt hat, tan shoes, and at somber necktie.\n\n“I think you dropped this,” said Garbett, presenting the purse to its portly owner.\n\nNaturally, Peter Riddick was astonished when he saw what the young man offered him.\n\n“Well, I’ll—Yes, that’s mine!” he said, his face breaking into a smile of startled happiness as he tapped a pocket and made sure his own wallet was missing. “Young man, I thank you.” He studied his benefactor again.\n\n“I’ve been coming to New York for the last thirty-five years,” he announced, “but never before has anyone—I’ve been robbed, and cheated, and double-charged, but—In New York City, too!”\n\nHe took the purse.\n\nGarbett smiled, and edged away.\n\n“Wait a minute, young man!” commanded Peter Riddick. “I not only want to thank you, I want to— You’re an honest man, and while some people say that virtue is its own reward, I think that honesty is a virtue that—”\n\n“I don’t want any reward,” Garbett interrupted. He didn’t mind being told that he was an honest man, for he had a sense of humor. “I saw your wallet drop, and so I brought it—”\n\n“If you’re in a hurry,” said Peter Riddick amiably, “I’ll walk along with you a little ways. For I’m not through with you, young man. I don’t want to hurt your feelings, but— Don’t you need a little help some way?”\n\n“Not that I know of,” Garbett answered, smiling. “I don’t need a thing, thank you.”\n\n“It certainly is strange to meet an honest man,” mused the white-haired gentleman, standing directly in the path of hundreds of hurrying people, “particularly when you’ve had to pay extra for theater tickets, and something for just sitting at a table when you want to eat, and—” His manner changed swiftly.\n\n“Young man, I want you to come in and see me. I live in Velma, Delaware, and I need you in my business. I’m the president of the First National Bank, and I can certainly find a place for an honest young man in my bank. Now if you—”\n\nGarbett’s ears twitched, and his eyes became introspective. Mr. Riddick thought these signs were good omens, and his shrewd, kindly eyes brightened.\n\n“A young man, an honest young man—” the portly gentleman paused. “I suppose you have something to do—but—if you ever need a job, and come in to see me, I will see that you get it.”\n\n“Well, I’m rather busy just now,” remarked Garbett, thinking of the wholesale silk house robbery.\n\n“That’s too bad,” Peter Riddick was sincerely regretful. “But—the time may come when you’ll need some help: a position, or a loan. I want you to call on me then, young man.” He extracted a card and a banknote from the wallet. “Here’s my name and address, and here’s something for—for you to buy a present for your best girl.”\n\nGarbett wanted the card, and he realized that Mr. Riddick really intended that he should accept the fifty-dollar bill.\n\nAlready, possibilities had flashed into the crook’s mind. Here was a perfect entree into the First National Bank of Velma, Delaware! The limitless opportunities here! Opportunities for an honest young man, of course.\n\nGarbett shook hands with Peter Riddick, and they parted with mutual expressions of esteem. And the crook put the bank president’s card carefully away where he could find it in case of need.\n\nThe fifty dollars was invested in a present for Mazie.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nSomething I Can Wear In My Hair\n\nNeeds, unfortunately, have a habit of arising. Two days after Mazie had finished her work the proprietor of the wholesale silk establishment had a new burglar alarm system put in and engaged the services of a private detective agency.\n\nTherefore when Garbett and his associates began their activities a number of things happened. Bells burst into sound, gray-clad private detectives rushed to the warehouse, and a rapid and undignified retreat was in order.\n\nOne of the gang, ‘Red’ Somer, the lookout, did not escape, and he was requested to mention the names of his fellow criminals.\n\nGarbett heard the call of the far and distant places. Red might not squeal, and then again he might. A bullet had pierced his thigh, he was kept in a hospital with a policeman stationed at the foot of his bed, and he had always been talkative.\n\nIf Red made statements, Garbett would be visited by blue-coats, and the crook did not care to meet officers of the law in either a social or a business way.\n\nPeter Riddick’s card was still in his possession, so Garbett decided to visit Velma, Delaware. With his usual care, he made thoughtful and intelligent preparations. First, he traveled to a small suburban town in New Jersey, and went straight to a hardware store on a side street.\n\nDan McKee was a black-haired man in the late forties who wore a ferocious mustache behind a long black cigar. In the rear of Dan’s tiny store was as complete and well-equipped a laboratory as even an instructor in chemistry could desire.\n\nIt was rumored that Dan had made a discovery that would be of great benefit to a certain section of the world’s inhabitants.\n\nSeveral drops of water will soften a lump of sugar; gold will dissolve in chlorine and aqua regia, or nitromuriatic acid; and Dan’s solvent had a swift and penetrating effect upon even the hardest and most burglar-proof steel. Poured upon a knife-blade, it turned the blade into a paperlike substance. Properly applied to a safe, it would turn the metal into material of the consistency of cheese. The solvent did not attack aluminum or glass or rubber.\n\nAfter a demonstration of the solvent, Garbett purchased a quart of the necessary liquid and returned to New York to say farewell, and ‘I’ll be back next week’ to Mazie.\n\nIn the Pennsylvania Station, Garbett made his farewell to Mazie. She was small and slender; she had a huge flood of golden brown hair; she wore a tan and deep blue scarf and a swagger coat suit of russet brown.\n\n“Goodbye,” said Mazie bravely, wondering whether Garbett would think of her every moment that he was away. “Bring me back a souvenir—something pretty.”\n\n“Any particular kind of souvenir?” he asked, glancing up at the enormous clock with its black hands and Roman numerals.\n\n“Oh—something—something I can wear in my hair,” she suggested.\n\nA moment of thoughtful silence. Mazie knew of a hundred things she wanted to say, but she couldn’t decide which one was the most important.\n\nGarbett had the uncomfortable feeling that he hadn’t a thing to say, but he wished Mazie would not look as though she was about to cry. .\n\n“Have you got it?” she asked. ‘It’ meaning Dan’s solvent.\n\n“Yes, and a quart of something else.” And then the announcer wailed his unintelligible and garbled song, which rose high and echoed from the ceiling, a signal that a train going for somewhere was soon to depart.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n##Chapter 3\n\nA Diamond Bar Pin\n\nLong lines of apple trees, mostly plucked of their fruit, could be seen from the car windows. Velma was a thriving town, boasting a drug-store, several large stores that kept in stock everything from needles, on through clothing, china, typewriters, tobacco, furniture, up to literature—the works of Harold Bell Wright. It had a garage, and the county jail, as well as that prosperous, at present, financial institution—the First National Bank.\n\nGarbett turned in between the stuccoed Colonial pillars of the bank, and entered the building. Behind a wire wall, beyond the desks and books, in the center of the ground floor, was the modern up-to-date bank safe.\n\n“Young man. I’m glad to see you! Just in time for lunch!” said Peter Riddick, coming out from behind the wire wall. To this white-haired, portly, beaming bank president, every male was “young man.”\n\n“Sit down, and rest yourself first,” he invited, leading the way into his private office, “and then we’ll go home for food.”\n\nIn the banker’s office Garbett told his carefully prepared story. He was, he said, on his way to Washington, but he had stopped off for an hour or two. He was expected in the Capital on the following morning, so he could not accept Mr. Riddick’s instant invitation to spend the night. All the time the crook was remembering the appearance of the inside of the bank; he had a mental picture of its interior now, and he would refresh it later, when they went to lunch.\n\nGarbett opened his suitcase and extracted a bottle and a corkscrew. While Peter Riddick waited expectantly, the crook sent the steel deep into the cork.\n\n“Have you got a glass?” asked Garbett, a trace of nervousness in his manner. He had made a mistake; he was about to open the bottle of solvent.\n\n“I’ll get one,” the bank president said, and departed with a smile of anticipation.\n\nThe moment he was out of the room, Garbett tore the corkscrew out, and hastily changed bottles. Almost at once the white-haired man returned with two glasses. He saw Garbett trying to force a crumbling corkscrew into place.\n\n“Very poor steel. Sorry.” The crook laughed at his own futile efforts. As fast as he thrust the corkscrew down it crumbled into bits.\n\nPeter Riddick was plainly puzzled; he tapped the corkscrew with a blunt finger. The steel flaked off and fell to the floor, and he rubbed it with his shoe. Now, the flakes were a fine powder that disappeared into the rug beneath his foot.\n\nFinally, the contents of the other bottle were sampled and approved, and then the crook was taken on a tour of the bank. He was shown the safe, and its various burglar-proof features, the workings of the time-lock, and an explanation of the way the safe was made fireproof.\n\nGarbett professed a total lack of knowledge of bank safes, though such was far from the case.\n\nGarbett felt not the slightest twinge of conscience. His profession was, in his opinion, an ancient and dishonorable one, but it was nevertheless his profession. From early days, according to the history he studied in college, there had been those who by skill or brute force, by cleverness or wit, had made their living in the same manner. By thrift and hard work, some men and nations rose to prosperity, and then other men, or other nations, came and conquered, or stole.\n\n“This is an honest man—an honest man from New York,” said Mr. Riddick, introducing Garbett to the office force of the bank. And Garbett acknowledged the soft impeachment, and shook hands with them all.\n\nAt luncheon the crook met Mrs. Riddick, a matronly, gray-haired woman who dressed in startling elegance. The lady had soft hands, splashed with diamonds, earrings that contained two large blazing stones; a crescent pin of white fire sent sparks from her ample bosom.\n\nAnd Garbett’s eyes held an odd expression as he saw the lavish use she made of such expensive bits of carbon.\n\nIn the afternoon Peter Riddick returned to the bank, while the crook strolled about the rambling streets of the town. He walked aimlessly, a frown of concentration on his face, as he planned his actions for later in the evening.\n\nThe train for Washington left at 9:45 from the railroad station at the southern end of the town. Riddick’s house was halfway between the bank and the station, five minutes from either one. Doubtless they would escort him to the station, and wait there with him until he had left the town.\n\nGarbett stopped in his walk, and stared at the signboard as he thought. He must devise some way to keep the Riddick from going with him to the station.\n\nHe needed thirty minutes—an hour would be far better—between the time he left the house and the time the train left.\n\nAlso, he wanted to know whether the bank was guarded at night. If there was a watchman, that individual would have to be silenced. Doubtless there was a police force in the town, too; he must make inquiries.\n\nGarbett came to himself, and his eyes read the signboard. Up to this time, he had been too busy thinking to look.\n\nCabaret and Dance\nVelma Dramatic Club\nTonight\n\nGarbett chuckled with amusement and strolled toward the garage. The Riddicks could be disposed of very simply. He remembered, now, that Mrs. Riddick had drawn the conversation during luncheon to artistic channels.\n\nOf course, she wanted to go to the “Cabaret and Dance” that evening; she was just the sort of woman who would desire to shine in society. Her diamonds insisted upon an audience.\n\nA grime and grease covered mechanic willingly ceased his languid investigations into the interior of a flivver and indulged in the luxury of a new listener.\n\n“We’ve only got one policeman,” he said, in answer to a question, “and he’s the worse one in the United States. Prohibition ruined Pop Gordon; he’s tried more recipes than any man in the county, and he makes the worst hooch in the State.\n\n“Why, he fed some of his stuff to a yellow dog I found, and the dog chewed up a tire casing trying to get the taste out of his mouth!”\n\n“Then who looks after traffic, and keeps an eye on things at night?”\n\n“Nobody,” answered the mechanic. “There’s not much traffic anyhow. Well, the next day, I saw that yellow dog looking sick, and—”\n\nGarbett let the youth continue, and finally satisfied himself that he had nothing to fear from an unwelcome interrupter. By the time the garage monologist had come to the end of his seventh saga of the town of Velma, it was time for dinner.\n\nAs he smoked a cigarette after the evening meal, the crook recalled his promise to Mazie. He had promised her “something for her hair,” yet he had not made a single purchase so far.\n\nA kerosene motor chugged in the cellar of the Riddick home, manufacturing electricity for the illumination of the house. Resplendently attired in a jade canton crepe evening gown, with bouffant draperies over the hips, Mrs. Riddick wore, also, her complete collection of diamonds.\n\n“Since you insist upon our going,” she said, when she returned to the room after a short absence, “I think we had better start.”\n\nGarbett rose instantly and took her opera cloak from her hands. She wore a bar pin of astonishing brilliancy in her hair at the side. The pin was crescent-shaped, large, with the usual simple clasp.\n\nPeter Riddick clambered into his overcoat and put his hand on the electric light button preparatory to pressing it. Mrs. Riddick held her cloak closely about her. Garbett stood near her, waiting until the lights should be extinguished. When they went out he would take the pin.\n\n“We are sorry that you are going,” said the bank president, as darkness dashed into the room. “An honest man, such as you, Mr. Garbett, is a rarity. But I know—”\n\nAt the words “honest man,” Garbett had unclasped the crescent bar pin, and by the time the sentence was finished he had slipped it into his pocket. Mazie was going to have a souvenir for her hair!\n\nTurning, the crook followed Mrs. Riddick from the room, leaving Peter Riddick to follow from the farther corner. The hour was 8:30, so he had plenty of time.\n\nThe walk through the crisp, fragrant air to the station was a pleasure. Not a cloud threatened from the sky; there was no moon; only the faint radiance of stars softened the darkness. Once in the railroad station, Garbett opened his suitcase and took out the bottle of Danny’s solvent.\n\nHe had, in the breast pocket of his coat, an eye-dropper, and he made sure that this was in working order. The station clock read 8:37. Garbett waited five minutes more, and then retraced his steps as far as Riddick’s home.\n\nThen the crook turned down an alley, passed in the rear of the garage and the drug store, and kept on to the back entrance of the bank. His mind was at ease; he even had an explanation prepared in case he was stopped.\n\nNext door to the bank was the hall where the “Cabaret and Dance” was in progress.\n\nIf questioned, Garbett was prepared to say that he had changed his mind and thought he would look in on the festivities until train time, but had lost his way in the darkness owing to his unfamiliarity with the town.\n\nThe explanation might not be convincing, but if said with an air of surprise and apology it would probably be believed.\n\nHe reached the rear door of the bank without trouble and extracted a short bar of aluminum from a pocket.\n\nWith this he pushed down the cork in the bottle of solvent until the liquid rose above it. Then he pressed the rubber bulb of the eye-dropper and half-filled the glass tube,\n\nHe carefully squirted the solvent into the keyhole of the door, directing the stream toward the bolt.\n\nA moment later he pulled upon the door and it opened. The solvent had acted instantly upon the metal lock of the door. Garbett waited, straining every muscle in an effort to hear a sound from the interior of the darkened building.\n\nThere was the bare possibility that Peter Riddick had dropped into the bank for some purpose. But the bank was deserted.\n\nFrom the adjoining building a strong and untrained masculine voice sang a negro dialect song written and composed by\ntwo Jews.\n\nGarbett was grateful for the noise; it made him feel safe and secure. He slipped noiselessly through the bank, looking into every room to make sure that a watchman would not surprise him later.\n\nOnce absolutely convinced that he alone was in the building, he began operations upon the safe.\n\nThe bottle of solvent was tilted against the back of the steel safe, and a small stream poured. Then, with the aluminum bar, Garbett dug the now soft and crumbling steel out in a thin line.\n\nFour feet to the left he poured more of the solvent, and then a horizontal line that connected the two cavities. He worked in complete darkness, thrusting with aluminum bar, trusting to the messages of his fingers, and he worked desperately fast.\n\nThe singer in the adjoining building had now received assistance. A dozen voices joined in on the chorus in an attempt at harmony.\n\nGarbett tore and thrust at the crumbling wall of the steel safe, digging a hole that led into the depths of the strong-box. Like a barrier, the wire wall cut off one-quarter of the room, and the long desk were heavy black shadows.\n\nSuddenly, every electric light in the bank flashed into life. Garbett froze, every muscle rigid, one arm elbow deep into the wall of the safe. He had been caught!\n\nOne swift glance over his shoulder and hope fell from him like a discarded garment.\n\nA huge and well-polished blue steel revolver, with a barrel eight inches long, was being pointed straight at the crook’s back. If he rose or moved that ponderous gun would explode. It was held by a nervous and excited man, whose rubicund face identified him as Pop Gordon, the town policeman.\n\n“Don’t move—don’t you dare move!” ordered Pop, dragging a pair of handcuffs from a sagging pocket of his ancient overcoat. He clicked one handcuff on Garbett’s right ankle, and the other on his left.\n\n“Stay right where you are.” He produced another pair of handcuffs, and fastened the crook’s hands behind his back.\n\nPeter Riddick had remained silent; now he put his small automatic back into his pocket.\n\n“Young man,” he said, “I am certainly disappointed. I thought you were honest. When I saw you steal that crescent pin from my wife’s hair I was the most surprised man in Velma, Delaware. I didn’t think—”\n\n“I’ll bet he’s a big New York crook,” said Pop Gordon. “Come look at the big hole in your safe, Mr. Riddick! If we had waited—”\n\nPeter Riddick observed the opening with brooding eyes. “That’s remarkable, but—I am sorry this young man made it. In about ten minutes he has—” He turned once more to Garbett.\n\n“I recall that your corkscrew fell to pieces. You are a clever young man,” he shook his head sadly, “but you are not an honest one.”\n\nGarbett knew that the evidence against him was complete and damning. He was helpless and hopeless. So he refused to answer any of the questions that were asked.\n\nPop Gordon led the crook through the starlit cool night, while the sound of dance music lilted gaily through the air. The huge, long-barreled revolver was pressed nervously against the crook’s side.\n\n“What’d you steal that pin for, anyway?” asked Pop Gordon. “You New Yorkers think you’re smart, but you ain’t! You ain’t smart at all. There was all that money in the bank, and you’d ’a got it, if you hadn’t been so smart. Stealing a two-dollar dingus from Mrs. Riddick’s hair and letting her husband see you. Why, he came right away and got me, and we followed you the whole way from the railroad station back to the bank. And all because of that two-dollar pin.\n\nGarbett sneered, and his mouth twisted in an unbelieving smile. “Two dollars? It’s worth five hundred! Isn’t she the wife of the president of the bank?”\n\n“Yes, sure she is,” cackled Pop, his watery eyes swimming with amusement. “But she ain’t stuck up. She bought that pin when she was a waitress in the Busy Bee Restaurant; bought it from a peddler long before she was married. And she wears it just to show folks that she ain’t stuck up, now that she can afford the real thing. She says the peddler told her the stones were real— were real white sapphires that came from Peru. And you thought you were smart!”\n\nLong after he had heard the whistle of the 9:45 train on its way to Washington, Garbett stayed awake. Pop Gordon was right. He wasn’t smart. He was a fool.\n\nShackled and manacled, locked in the county jail while the New York police were being notified, Garbett realized he was a fool.\n\nIf he had only been honest—\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Unlike Sonia, there was nothing light and frivolous about her.\n\n“What! At this time in the morning I” she declared frigidly.\n\nSonia laughed. “Go on, Janie. Do you good. Just like a pick-me-up.”\n\n“It seems such an awful waste of money to me. A big box like that just for one person.”\n\n“Oh, but I haven’t bought them. They’ve just come by the eleven o’clock post. A present, Janie—from an unknown admirer! Try one of the goldpaper ones—they’re Benedictine.” Almost grudgingly Nurse Wilmot put her hand into the box and took a liqueur chocolate wrapped in gold-coloured foil.\n\n“You won’t tell Mr. Priestly, will you?” she said sharply.\n\nAgain Sonia laughed. “Oh, he won’t mind if you have a little pick-me-up,” she said.\n\n“I don’t mean that, Mrs. Priestly. I mean about the unknown admirer! I’m sure it s none of my business how you behave towards other men, but it is my business when it affects my patient. And he’s looking much better today. If you tell him some man has sent you chocolates, it will only worry him and send up his temperature again.”\n\nSonia picked out a cherry brandy chocolate and popped it into her mouth.\n\n“He never gets to know anything about my amusements through me,” she said meaningly. “They’re quite harmless, anyway. Why shouldn’t I dance or go on the river if men my own age ask me to? John can’t expect me to sit beside his bed all day long. John–”\n\nSuddenly her voice stopped. Her hands darted to her throat, and she gave a strangled gasp.\n\nNurse Wilmot stared in horror at her patient’s young wife.\n\n“Mrs. Priestly, what’s the matter?”\n\n“I—I feel so—so–” But without another word Sonia collapsed on the floor and passed into a state of semi-consciousness.\n\nTen minutes later she was dead!\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n##Chapter 1\n\nThe Poisoned Chocolates\n\nDr. Hollis, the Priestlys’ medical attendant, was at the house within half an hour.\n\n“I can’t understand it,” said Nurse Wilmot. “Ono minute she was talking to me as gay and happy-go-lucky as usual; the next, there she was stretched out on the floor. I should never have believed she’d got anything wrong with her. But there—you can’t tell with those that burn the candle at both ends, can you? Many’s the time she’s never come back to the house until two or three in the morning.”\n\n“There was nothing wrong with Mrs. Priestly’s constitution,” said Dr. Hollis coldly.\n\n“Nothing wrong! But–”\n\n“Mrs. Priestly was poisoned,” continued the medical man. “By one of the alkaloid group. Every symptom suggests it, and I’m certain an autopsy will prove it.”\n\nThe nurse’s face paled. “Poisoned! It’s impossible. She—”\n\n“Poisons of that type act quickly, as you probably know, nurse. What had Mrs. Priestly eaten just before she collapsed?”\n\nJane Wilmot leaned forward tensely. “Oh, it must have been the chocolates!” she declared. Her face went even whiter. “And I ate one myself—just before she did!”\n\n“Well, yours couldn’t have been poisoned; you would have been in a coma by now. Chocolates, eh? Where did she get them?”\n\n“They came by the morning parcel post. From an unknown admirer.”\n\nDr. Hollis went to the door.\n\n“The phone’s in the hall, isn’t it? The sooner the police are on this the better.”\n\nA minute later he returned.\n\n“How about Priestly?” he asked. “Has it given him a shock?”\n\nNurse Wilmot shook her head.\n\n“I haven’t told him,” she replied. “I wouldn’t take the responsibility of doing so. Poor man! It will upset him badly, I’m afraid.”\n\nDr. Hollis went upstairs to break the news to the invalid John Priestly.\n\nThe old man took it almost without any show of emotion.\n\n“How did it happen, doctor?” he asked quietly.\n\nDr. Hollis tried to introduce his suspicions lightly.\n\nBut John Priestly’s brain was still the active brain of a young and clever man even if at sixty his body had failed him so miserably.\n\n“You mean you suspect foul play? Poisoning?”\n\nThe doctor nodded.\n\nPriestly raised himself on the pillows.\n\n“Get Hawke for me—Dixon Hawke!” he said. “He’ll settle this in half the time the police will. Somewhere in Dover Street; you’ll find the number in the London telephone directory. Tell him to get here as quickly as he can. He’ll know my name—I employed him in several commercial cases. He’ll come.”\n\n“Very well, I’ll phone him right away,” said Dr. Hollis.\n\nDixon Hawke and his assistant. Tommy Burke arrived little more than an hour later. They had flown to Shoreham airport and driven by road from there to John Priestly’s modern mansion on the South Downs six miles from Worthing.\n\nInspector Denver, of the South Sussex constabulary, met him in the hall.\n\n“Well, Hawke, you haven’t lost much time.”\n\nHawke smiled. It was some five years since he had worked with Denver on a large-scale smuggling case, and he remembered that the inspector then had only thinly-concealed his distaste for unofficial assistance.\n\n“I guessed you’d have it all settled if I didn’t get down quickly, Inspector,” he said lightly.\n\nDenver Hushed. “This isn’t the sort of case for quick results. We shall have to do a lot of donkey work before we get on the right track. But we’ll find it all right; the police organisation can’t fail in a crime of this type.”\n\n“Meaning you don’t think it’s a job for me?” murmured Hawke.\n\nThe inspector shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“Well, no offence, Hawke, but one man can’t possibly investigate all the possibilities there are in this affair—not in the time the police will take, anyway. You see, this Mrs. Priestly had plenty of enemies. One of them sent her a box of poisoned chocolates. Well, we shall make a list of suspects and then tackle each one of them for an alibi for the time when the chocolates were handed in at the post office.”\n\n“Splendid,” declared the famous criminologist. “In that case I shall earn my fee without having to do much work for it. I’ll join you later, Inspector. I must go and report my arrival to my old friend, John Priestly.”\n\nTommy Burke followed him to the foot of the staircase.\n\n“Hang around, Tommy,” said Hawke, “and keep your ears open for facts.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n##Chapter 2\n\nThe Invalid\n\nUpstairs in the invalid’s bedroom Hawke was distressed to see the feeble physical condition of the man whom he had once considered to be the fittest and most alert director in the City. But he soon realised that John Priestly had lost none of his old mental qualities.\n\n“I should never have married Sonia, Hawke. I freely admit it. But perhaps she never had a fair chance; I became a bedridden invalid just four months after we were married. She was only thirty—it was only natural she should want to enjoy herself elsewhere and with people of her own age. Had I remained fit and active we should have travelled—seen the world.”\n\nJohn Priestly sighed.\n\n“As it has turned out, I hardly saw her save for a few minutes each day. You see, I don’t need a wife, Hawke; only a nurse and occasional visits from Harley Street. I can’t pretend that I loved my wife—I was disappointed in her, to be perfectly frank. I felt that she might have spared me a little more of the time she so readily gave to—to others.\n\n“But someone has killed her, Hawke! And I will spare no expense until that someone is brought to trial! That is why I sent for you. Whether her death means less to me than people would think or not, she was under my protection and under my roof when she was poisoned!”\n\n“You’ve no suspicions, sir?” asked Hawke quietly.\n\nThe old man shook his head sadly.\n\n“None. Ever since we came here I have been confined to this room. I know nothing of her friends—or her enemies. I know very little, too, of her past; we were married within two month of our first meeting.”\n\nAt that moment the door opened. Hawke turned his head sharply to see a nurse with a dark, sallow face peering in.\n\n“My nurse,” explained Priestly. “She’ll tell you more than I can about Sonia. She was with her when it happened. In fact, she might have been poisoned herself—she had one of the chocolates–”\n\n“Now, you mustn’t upset yourself, Mr. Priestly,” broke in Nurse Wilmot. “You’ve your own health to consider, you know–”\n\n“This is Mr. Dixon Hawke, Janie. He’s going to settle this dreadful business for us.”\n\nThe nurse nodded coldly, as if already accusing Hawke of disturbing her patient.\n\n“I’d like to ask you a few questions later, nurse,” said Hawke as he left the room.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n##Chapter 3\n\nTracing the Parcel\n\nDownstairs again the private detective asked Inspector Denver if he could see the box of chocolates.\n\n“I can tell you all there is to know about them,” said Denver, waving his hand to a large oblong box on the table. “Eight different kinds of liqueur chocolates—but only one kind has been tampered with. The cherry brandy ones have all got a little hole drilled in them from underneath.”\n\nHawke nodded. “So the murderer must have known Mrs. Priestly well enough to know that she particularly liked cherry brandy, and would probably take one of them first, as she did. What about the wrappings of the box?”\n\nDenver produced a large piece of brown paper.\n\n“This was in the wastepaper basket,” he said. “Postmarked at Brighton. We shall trace it back to where it was handed in, with any luck.”\n\nHawke examined the blurred markings across the stamp. The parcel had been handled at the sorting office at 7.30 p.m. the previous day.\n\n“The paper’s ordinary enough,” he commented. “Thousands of pieces like it everywhere.”\n\nInspector Denver smiled. “Yes, I thought that even a private detective wouldn’t get a clue out of that.”\n\n“And the string?”\n\n“Just the same—ordinary common or garden string.”\n\nThe inspector produced a length of string from his pocket.\n\n“I see that it was cut and not untied,” Hawke remarked while he examined the knot still left in the string.\n\n“Well, what of that? Did you ever see a woman open a parcel patiently? Of course she cut it–”\n\n“Yes,” said Hawke, coolly, “but what a good thing for us!”\n\nWithout attempting to explain himself, he handed the length of string back to Denver.\n\nThe inspector stared at him with a puzzled, almost annoyed, expression.\n\n“You’re still working on your list of possible enemies, I suppose?” Hawke went on.\n\nDenver grunted. “Yes. And I don’t mind saying it means a long job. Sonia Priestly seems to have spent most of her time playing about with the emotions of half Sussex. Fortunately she kept all her correspondence.”\n\n“Then suppose I tackle the sorting office at Brighton? The box made rather an unusual shaped parcel—we ought to be able to trace it back.”\n\nInspector Denver hesitated. “Well, I was going to send Sergeant Welsh over there this afternoon, but–”\n\n“The Chief Constable won’t object to my going surely?”\n\n“Well, all right,” snapped Denver. “I’ll tell Welsh to go over with you now. There’s no point in it until we’ve established a list of suspects, but you might as well be doing something, I suppose.” Hawke chuckled. “Self-importance in a policeman,” he mused, “is the criminal’s best friend.”\n\nAt the Brighton postal sorting office, however, he found officialdom more impressed by the mention of his famous name. Clerks and postmen set up lines of inquiry immediately they saw the parcel temporarily rewrapped in its original shape.\n\nIt took time, but eventually results were forthcoming. The parcel had been collected by the van calling at the suboffices of Bream Road, Finch Street, Albert Road, Downs Avenue, and Royal Street. But the postman could not remember at which post office he had picked it up.\n\nHawke and Sergeant Welsh at once proceeded to each of these branches of the postal service in turn. At Bream Road they were definitely told the parcel had not been handed in there. At Finch Street they found uncertainty. Albert Road and Downs Avenue, however, were quite sure they hadn’t handled it.\n\n“We might have known it would be the last on the list,” said Hawke. *\n\nThe sub-postmistress at Royal Street remembered the parcel well.\n\n“Usually people want us to weigh parcels, but this one was handed in already stamped. I said I’d check it, but the woman said she knew it was all right, and walked out before I’d even put it on the scales.”\n\n“And it was correctly stamped?”\n\n“Yes, so I put it under the counter and thought no more about it.”\n\n“What was this lady like?” asked Hawke.\n\n“I hardly saw her. I’m afraid. She just handed it in and then went. She was dressed in dark clothes—a costume, I think, but I wouldn’t like to say for sure. Her face was painted more than any woman’s ought to be, that I will say! Only she came and went so quickly, and this is a busy shop.’’\n\n“Of course,” said Hawke gently. “About what height was she?”\n\n“Average, I’d say. She wasn’t especially tall or short.”\n\n“How about her build? Was she slim or stout?”\n\n“Just ordinary, I think, sir. She might have been a bit on the lean side rather than plump, if you know what I mean. But I wouldn’t be telling the truth if I said more than that.”\n\nHawke smiled encouragingly. “I wish all witnesses we have to question would confine themselves to just what they are certain of and no more,” ha said. “Now, how about the time? Can you tell us when she called?”\n\nThe postmistress looked happier. “Yes, sir, I can help you there. It must have been after half-past five because the parcel missed that collection; and before six because that’s when I go for my tea.”\n\n“Between five-thirty and six, eh?”\n\n“Yes, and I’d say at a guess about a quarter to six, and I don’t think I’d be far out.”\n\n“Splendid. You’d never seen her before, of course?”\n\n“Oh, no, sir. An absolute stranger to these parts she was.”\n\nThe Dover Street detective thanked her for her assistance, then left with Sergeant Welsh to drive back to the house on the Downs.\n\n“You noticed that the postmistress herself wasn’t averse to a pretty liberal use of lipstick?” said Hawke.\n\nThe sergeant nodded.\n\n“Therefore the woman who posted the parcel must have been excessively over-painted. One devotee of the cosmetics industry rarely criticises another without fair cause.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n##Chapter 4\n\nWanted—A Girl Guide!\n\nIt was past three when they returned to Priestly’s house.\n\n“Well, Hawke,” said Inspector Denver sarcastically, “do you know who we’ve got to arrest yet?”\n\nDixon Hawke shook his head.\n\nThe inspector produced a sheet of notepaper on which was written a number of names.\n\n“One of those seven people sent the chocolates,” he announced. “Seven people in this district who have good reason to hate Sonia Priestly. Four wives whose husbands she had played about with and whose homes you can therefore say she’d seriously threatened; one girl whose fiancé she had captivated, and so caused the breaking of a previously happy engagement; and two men who, judging from their letters, didn’t like the way she’d dropped them stone cold without reason. Now you see—we’ll soon nail down one of those seven, Hawke. Hard work and routine investigation—none of the flash- of-genius business.”\n\nThe criminologist glanced at the list. “Well, you can cross off the two men, Denver, because that parcel was posted by a woman.” He told the inspector the details. “And, if I were you,” he added casually, “I’d find out which of the five women have been Girl Guides.”\n\n“Girl Guides!” exclaimed the inspector.\n\nHawke chuckled. “I don’t think it will help you much, though, because my suspect isn’t on your list. But if I’m wrong—well, it might.”\n\nHe walked away to find Tommy Burke, and hear whether the youngster had anything to report.\n\nTommy was run to earth busily chatting with the chauffeur in the garage.\n\n“Well, Tommy, any finds?”\n\nHawke’s assistant looked glum.\n\n“Nothing much, guv’nor. Inspector Denver hasn’t allowed me to do a thing.”\n\n“Yes, I thought he’d be a bit unfriendly.”\n\n“I’ve been getting round the servants, though, and they’re all worked up.”\n\n“Naturally. A murder is–”\n\nTommy Burke’s eyes lit up excitedly. For once he was a jump ahead of Ins brilliant “guv’nor.”\n\n“No, not so much that. They’re all furious the way the nurse has taken charge of the whole house. She’s giving orders to the cook and the maids, and they can’t stand it. Besides, they haven’t been told to acknowledge her authority, so–”\n\n“Good, Tommy,” broke in Hawke. “Just what I expected, if my theory is correct. But I hardly expected it so soon. What a pity for Denver that he hasn’t noticed it himself. Right under his nose, too.” Hawke leaned forward.\n\n“Tommy, find out as quickly as you can whether Nurse Wilmot had the afternoon off yesterday, and, if she did, at what time she got back here. I’ll wait for you here. I don’t want to make a further move until I know.”\n\n“I can soon find out about that,” said Burke, dashing off to the back of the house.\n\nFive minutes later he was back.\n\n“OK, guv’nor,” he exclaimed. “She was off duty, and she didn’t get back until after seven!”\n\nHawke smiled grimly.\n\n“Now, Tommy, I want you to indulge in a little burglary. While I’m questioning Nurse Wilmot downstairs, get into her room and see if you can find any lipsticks or other cosmetics. You may only find a handkerchief on which paint has been wiped off. If you’re successful, don’t wait—come downstairs and interrupt us!”\n\nOnce again Tommy Burke sped away towards the back of the house.\n\nDixon Hawke went indoors and waited in the lounge while a servant took a message to Nurse Wilmot asking her if she could spare him a few minutes.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n##Chapter 5\n\nThe Clue of the Cosmetics\n\nA little while later the nurse entered the room.\n\n“I can’t leave Mr. Priestly for long,” she said sharply. “I shouldn’t have left him at all after the shock he’s had to-day.”\n\n“From what I know of John Priestly,” said Hawke calmly, “he can still survive mental or emotional shocks. And a very good thing, too, for he may receive another shock before the day is out.”\n\nThe nurse gave a nervous start.\n\n“What—what do you mean, Mr. Hawke?”\n\n“I mean that I think I know who sent the poisoned chocolates to Sonia Priestly—and why! Nurse, a woman posted that parcel yesterday at Brighton. I understand that you were off duty during the afternoon. May I ask how you spent your time and where?”\n\nThe nurse’s face went ashen grey.\n\n“You have no right to ask such a question—no right at all! Why should I have questions asked about where I’ve been? I had one of the chocolates myself—it might have been me who was poisoned, not her–”\n\n“Whoever put poison into those chocolates, nurse, knew quite well that only one kind had been tampered with. Where were you yesterday between five and six?”\n\n“I—I went to the pictures. I can’t prove it. I went alone. No—no. I never went to Brighton at all. Why are you daring to suspect me? Why should I want to kill Sonia?”\n\n“You had a strong motive for desiring Mrs. Priestly’s removal,” said Hawke smoothly. “Priestly is worth at least half a million, but I’m afraid he’s not going to live very long to enjoy it. As an invalid he needed you far more than he needed a young and flighty wife. With Sonia Priestly dead, you could easily persuade him to marry you, and, since he would then have no one else to whom he could leave his money, you would soon inherit that considerable fortune. Elderly and lonely invalids marry their nurses very often, don’t they, Nurse Wilmot?”\n\n“This is insufferable! Mr. Hawke, I–”\n\n“But not unreasonable. Why, already I understand you have assumed the management of the house!”\n\n“I will complain to Mr. Priestly. How dare you throw servants’ tittle-tattle into my face like that!”\n\nAt that moment the door burst open and Tommy Burke dashed in.\n\n“Here’s what you wanted, guv’nor!” he exclaimed excitedly. “Plenty of make-up material and the handkerchiefs.”\n\nDixon Hawke looked gravely at four sticks of cosmetic paint and three handkerchiefs stained from the removal of heavy applications of make-up.\n\n“You—you’ve been to my room?” cried the nurse.\n\n“I see. You admit that these are yours then?” said Hawke. “Strange, for you never use cosmetics normally. But what a neat method of disguising yourself if you wanted to for any purpose—such as posting a parcel at Royal Street, Brighton! That woman was heavily made up, Nurse Wilmot!” Jane Wilmot breathed heavily. For a moment she stood and stared at the criminologist with blazing hatred in her eyes. Then she fell into a chair and began to sob bitterly.\n\n“Yes, I did it!” she burst out suddenly. “I hated her I She meant nothing to him—nothing. I was the one who looked after him while she deceived him. Why should she have got all his money when he died—for nothing?”\n\nHawke turned to his assistant.\n\n“Tommy, go and fetch Inspector Denver and tell him the case is ended!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n##Chapter 6\n\nThe “Knot” is Untied\n\nAn hour later Inspector Denver was in a very subdued mood.\n\n“But what beats me is how you got on to it, Hawke. It was pure guesswork, wasn’t it?”\n\n“It was the string,” smiled Hawke. “You see, the parcel had been tied with a reef knot. And people don’t tie reef knots unless they have been trained to do so. Sailors, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, firemen, and so on. And once I found it was a woman who had posted the parcel, I was almost certain it was Nurse Wilmot, because it’s a stem rule in hospitals that all slings and bandages are tied with reef knots I” “That’s what you meant about the Girl Guides, was it?”\n\nHawke chuckled. “Yes. If Nurse Wilmot had an alibi that she could prove, I thought that perhaps one of your ladies on the list might have learnt to tie a reef knot that way.”\n\nInspector Denver coughed and cleared his throat.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Professionally, he now called himself Burton, Buddy Burton, but he had been born plain Joe Caterisano, in a brick row house on the outskirts of Newark, NJ. His Latin blood showed in his raven black hair, in his slightly overripe but wholly natural gestures, as he punched emphasis into the worn-out words of the old song lyric. He was swarthily, masculinely handsome, and he sang, people said, like a bird.\n\n“You kill me,” a girl had told him at a party, a few evenings ago. “I don’t know what you’ve got, but every time I hear you sing something inside of me starts to flutter and then I just go all to pieces.”\n\n“I’ll settle for that inside flutter,” he had gagged. “I don’t want to kill anybody, Miss Barney.”\n\nHe wished everyone well. The world, of late, had been a wonderful place to be in, from his personal standpoint. After he’d knocked them dead in the three nightclub bookings, his agent, Max Gittman, had got him this spot on TV, a fifteen-minute, three-nights-a-week summer sustain-er, and now things were coming his way so fast he was dizzy.\n\n“Kid, you’re a shoo-in,” Max had told him. “Ever since you chucked that library of Como, Clark, Crosby and Sinatra in the ashcan, and started being plain Joe Caterisano—er, excuse me, Buddy Burton, that is —I could smell success on you. I mean strong, kid. Like garlic. I’ll make a prediction.”\n\n“What, Max?”\n\n“Two years from now,” Max said, “you’ll be so fat you won’t know what to do with your money. You’re on the way, kid, and all roads lead up, in a hurry.”\n\nHe wrapped up his smooth rendition of Careless, giving it that characteristic Buddy Burton punch at the end, and a few seconds later the big red hand moved past the hour, and be could relax once more. The hungry eyes of the TV cameras no longer gobbled up each small derail of his face and figure for projection into millions of homes throughout the eastern half of the nation served by this TV network.\n\nHe rode the elevator down to the studio garage, and drove his car downtown and through the Tunnel, and an hour later be was relaxing in the living room of his modest house in the Jersey suburbs, listening to Marie tell him how she bad reacted to his broadcast.\n\n“I couldn’t pick out anything to criticize, Joe,” she said seriously, a little loving frown on her pretty face, for she knew how he hungered for any small criticism which might help him improve on his performance. “You put those three songs over perfect.”\n\n“Come on, baby,” be pleaded. “There must’ve been something.”\n\n“I don’t know what,” she said. “Even when you were talking with the announcer, you seemed—just natural. Like it wasn’t something somebody had written down for you to say.”\n\n“I was perfect then?” Joe kidded. “Better watch out baby. I’ll be getting swell-headed.”\n\n“No you won’t,” Marie said, and she smiled, a small and warm movement of her pretty lips. “You’re too sensible for that, Joe. You worked eight years for this and you’re thirty years old, a man with a wife and three children, and a sense of humor about things. I guess I know my husband by now, Joe.”\n\nAnd she kissed him fondly.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Note\n\nThey went up to bed and at eleven-thirty, the phone rang. Joe threw a robe over pajamas and padded downstairs in bare feet to see what it was.\n\n“Burton?” the voice said.\n\n“This is Buddy Burton.”\n\n“You stink, Burton. I caught you on the TV tonight, and you stink.”\n\nHe had only just begun to be somebody, but he had always known that once he got there he would have cranks to contend with. He couldn’t help grinning, remembering what he’d said to Marie about getting stuck on himself.\n\nNot much danger of that, with characters around like this one on the other end of the wire.\n\n“You may have something there, pal. Anything else on your mind? If not, I’ll go back to bed.”\n\n“Put that voice or whatever you call it in mothballs, Burton. Go back to driving a truck for a living.”\n\n“Not till I have to,” he laughed, trying to keep this exchange on a good-natured level. “There’s more dough in the singing than in truck driving.”\n\n“Get off the TV, Burton,” the voice gritted. “That’s a warning.”\n\nThe phone clicked dead and he stood there frowning at it for a moment before he replaced it in its cradle. Upstairs, Marie said sleepily, “Who was it, honey?”\n\n“Just some squawk,” Joe said. “Wanted to tell me I can’t sing worth a damn.”\n\nMarie’s eyes opened, showing fright for a moment, and he said comfortingly,\n\n“Guess we’re really on our way now, baby. Max Gittman says you can tell you’re beginning to get there when people start pestering you this way.”\n\nMarie was up earlier than he, because of the kids. She went down and brought the milk in, and promptly ran upstairs to show him a note that had been thrust under the kitchen door.\n\nIt had been fashioned out of words and letters snipped from the New York newspapers. It said:\n\nGET OUT OF TV, KID. BIG MONEY AIN’T WORTH IT. HOW MUCH DOUGH CAN YOU SPEND SIX FEET UNDER?\n\n“I’m scared,” Marie said. Her eyes were wide, under the dark lashes, and her mouth trembled. “What are we going to do, Joe?”\n\n“Just some nut,” Joe said. “Some—”\n\n“You can’t dismiss it like that, Joe. This is a threat on your life. Take it to the police. Please?” she said.\n\nHe frowned at the prospect, but looking at Marie, sensing her fear for his safety, he knew he had no real choice in the matter…\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nWhaddaya Want Me To Do?\n\n“Under the kitchen door, hey?” the Chief of Police said. He bit the end off a stogie and stared hard at Joe across the tip of it, before striking his match.\n\n“I been seeing you on my television, kid. You sing pretty. On your way, I’d say. Maybe another Sinatra.”\n\n“Thank you,” Joe said, and his cheeks reddened.\n\n“Now,” said the chief, “lemme get this thing straight. A guy phones you last night, tells you you stink as a crooner, and tells you to go back driving a truck, right?”\n\n“That’s right,” Joe nodded.\n\n“You laugh him off, so this a.m. the wife finds the note. All right, now whaddaya want me to do, Burton?”\n\n“You know your business, Chief. What’s your usual—”\n\n“Usually, in a case like this, we’d turn the story over to the newspaper and the publicity, plus the information we’re holding ourselves responsible for your personal safety, would be enough to scare whoever put that note under your door back in his rat hole.” The chief blew cigar smoke at him, and frowned thoughtfully through it. “But somehow I ain’t worried about your safety, Burton.”\n\n“What does that mean?”\n\n“Judging from the way you’re coming along as a crooner, I’d say you got a smart business manager. Right?”\n\n“Right. Max Gittman.”\n\n“Give Max Gittman a message for me, will you, kid?”\n\n“What message?”\n\n“Tell him my police department is gettin’ tired of bein’ the Patsy for every young Tom, Dick and Harry in show business that wants to stir up a fuss and get his name splashed around in the papers, complete with a picture showing his best profile to his public.”\n\n“You think this is just a publicity stunt,” Joe said woodenly. “But it—”\n\n“Get outta here, Burton. I’m gonna tell you something. I got three girls home that are coming the dangerous age, and I don’t like crooners.”\n\n“But—”\n\n“I give you enough time already. Get out. Tell that Gittman what I said. You want publicity, you go out and earn it. Go overseas and entertain some of the boys that are fighting to keep this country safe for you crooners.”\n\n“I did my share of that,” Joe protested hotly. “I spent three years as a dogface, back in—”\n\n“Don’t cry on me, Burton. I lost two boys over there in the last one. Now get outta here, before I lose my temper.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThis Is A Stick-Up\n\nHe drove in Tuesday afternoon to rehearse for that evening’s show, and Alec Thornbush, the program director, remarked that he seemed nervous.\n\n“It’s nothing,” Joe told him. “Been off my feed the last day or two, Alec.”\n\nHe got through the show better than he had hoped to, rising to the occasion like any seasoned campaigner, but he hurried down to get his car, when it was over. In the back of his mind was a nameless worry; somehow he was eager to be home again, to know that Marie and the kids were okay.\n\nAs he nosed the car out to the street, he had to wait for the light to change at the corner. A man in a light tan topcoat, wearing a felt hat pulled low over his eyes, stepped casually up to the car, on the passenger side, opened the door, and slid in beside Joe.\n\nJoe felt a tightness in his throat as he peered toward the intruder.\n\n“Sorry,” he said, underplaying his role. “No riders.”\n\n“I guess you said that a lot back when you were wheeling a truck for a living, didn’t you, Caterisano? This is a gun in my pocket.” He jabbed it through the tan cloth of the coat, stretching the cloth out to a little cone against the gun’s muzzle, so Joe could get the idea. “Drive,” he suggested.\n\nJoe saw that the street was momentarily clear and he swung out from the garage, heading toward the Avenue of the Americas. “This is a stick-up,” he suggested hopefully.\n\n“You recognized me. You want my money.”\n\n“Drive,” the man said. He kept his face averted. He had on thick-lensed glasses. His coat lapels were turned up, hiding his chin and partly concealing his mouth.“And don’t do anything I might not like, pal. You just did another TV show, Caterisano. After I asked you not to. You get me kind of mad, pal. I don’t know what I’m goin’ to do with you.”\n\n“What’s this all about?” Joe said angrily. “I never saw you before, friend. Why should you have it in for me?”\n\n“Another thing,” the man said. “You went to the cops, after I left that note under the kitchen door.”\n\n“I—”\n\n“I happen to know you did. Because I tailed you. You made me plenty mad, pal. What did the cops say?”\n\nThe man not only talked mad, he looked mad. The gun again made a cone-shaped bulge against, the pocket of the tan topcoat, and, like a dog, the man seemed to be bristling with anger.\n\n“They laughed at me,” Joe tried to mollify him. “They seemed to think I was gunning for some free publicity at their expense, if you must know.”\n\n“You know something?” the man laughed. “I can believe that. I don’t think you’re lying.”\n\n“What’s your angle?” Joe said. “What do you want of me? I don’t—”\n\n“Pull up to the curb down there in the next block, Caterisano, and turn off that ignition. We’ll talk a little.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nMr. X.\n\nJoe parked at the curb and turned for a better look at his rider.\n\nThe man said, “Uh-unh. You keep staring straight ahead, through the windshield. Now, you asked what I want, and I’ve already told you, but I’m ready to give you one more chance, pal. I want you to quit singing. Get oat of show business, see? Find some other way to earn a living, pal.”\n\n“I worked hard for the break I’m finally getting,” Joe said. “What are you, some kind of a nut? You don’t know what you’re asking.”\n\n“I’m telling, not asking. Get out of show business, Caterisano, or—”\n\n“Or what?”\n\n“I’ll kill you,” the man said in a matter-of-fact tone of voice that sent a sharp chill up Joe’s backbone.\n\n“Why?” Joe said. “Be reasonable. I’m entitled to at least some explanation.”\n\n“I’ll give you some explanation,” the man said. “I’m a guy who never took to working for a living, pal. The way I get mine is my own business, see? And let’s say the cops would like to make it their business, but I’m just a little too smart for them. Get the idea?”\n\n“More or less.”\n\n“I’ve never been mugged. I’ve never been printed,” the man said.\n\n“I don’t pull off many jobs, and when I do pull one off, I make it a big one. I operate solo. I trust nobody. I never go after anything but the hard cash. Jewelry has a way of fingering a guy, sooner or later. I won’t have anything to do with it.”\n\nJoe said, “I guess I’m not very bright. What does all this have to do with my getting out of show business?”\n\n“So far I’m an anonymous,” the man said. “I’m Mr. X. Oh, I been seen by a few people. But you know, it’s kind of funny how little help that is to the cops, pal. A guy walks into a place and holds it up, let’s say, for a couple of thousand, and gets away clean. So the guy on the unhappy end of the stickup goes to the cops and gives his description of the man, and what’s it add up to? Tall, dark, maybe handsome, dressed in this or that color suit. So what of it? What are the bulls going to do with it? Nothing.”\n\n“If there’s a gimmick here somewhere,” Joe said wearily, “I still don’t get it.”\n\n“Don’t worry about it,” the man said. “Start the car. Get it rolling. When we get down to that next stoplight, I’ll be getting out, pal. And you’ll keep on rolling.”\n\n“I see,” Joe said and it did not occur to him to disobey the man’s curt instructions.\n\n“One thought I’m goin’ to leave with you, pal. Get out of show business. Break clean, see? One more TV show, like tonight, and I’m goin’ to have to do for you. You can make your own choice, pal.”\n\nJoe had come by now to the stoplight. It was red. He pulled up, waiting. The man opened the door and stepped onto the paving.\n\n“Just drive on when the light changes,” he said. “Don’t look back.”\n\nThe light changed. Joe started the car, started across the intersection, and pivoted on the seat for a quick look at his man.\n\nBright headlights from the oncoming traffic flickered momentarily across the man’s face, spotlighting him, half-blinding him for one instant.\n\nJoe Caterisano got a very good look at the man, despite the lowered hat brim, the turned-up lapels of the coat, the eyeglasses. A sharp pulse of surprise slid through his tense body as he drove the big car down the street, and he said softly, “Well, I’ll be damned. So that’s his angle.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nI Ain’t Buying\n\nThe Chief of Police stared at Joe across the glowing tip of a mangled cigar and said, “I checked that claim of yours, that you put in a couple years as a dogface in the war, kid.”\n\n“Three years,” Joe said. “Not a couple. I was at the Normandy beachhead, and in the Bulge, and—”\n\n“And in a psycho ward for a couple months, after, accordin’ to my information,” the chief said. He scowled at Joe, obviously still not liking what he saw, still disapproving the way Joe earned his living.\n\n“Maybe you’re havin’ a relapse,” he suggested.\n\n“I tell you, the guy means to kill me,” Joe said.\n\n“Yeah. Sure.”\n\n“I saw his face. He’s a dead ringer for me, Chief. I’m sure of it, even if he did have on those cheaters. Are you such a knucklehead that you can’t see why he’s scared?”\n\n“Kid,” growled the chief, big shoulders bunching up within the confining blue uniform coat, “you better go easy. You ain’t that big a shot yet, you can talk to me that way.”\n\n“Look,” Joe said wearily, “suppose I was a big shot. Like say, Sinatra. A big enough shot so that everybody, well, practically everybody, knew what I look like. And this guy happens to be a dead ringer for me. So what happens, the next time he tries to pull off a job, Chief?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Somebody gets a good look at him. Ordinarily they couldn’t describe him, except in a general way. But this time—”\n\n“They’d say,” cut in the chief, “he looks just like Buddy Burton, the famous crooner on TV and in the movies. Is that what you’re selling me, kid?”\n\n“That’s what I’m selling. A couple more months on TV and I’ll be fingering this guy. And he knows it.”\n\nThe chief stared ruminatively at him through a cloud of cigar smoke. “This is like something out of a crummy paper-back, cops-and-robbers story. Go back and tell your friend Gittman, or whoever dreamed up this one, that I ain’t buying. I still ain’t handing you any free publicity, kid.”\n\n“This is on the level,” Joe protested.\n\n“Yeah, sure,” the chief scoffed. “Go on. Get outta here, kid. You told your story. I listened, but only because I’m paid to listen to stories. But I ain’t paid to believe ‘em. And I still don’t like crooners.”\n\n“I want a police guard when I put my next TV show on,” Joe said insistently.\n\n“You want publicity, kid. Go buy yourself some. You’re makin’ money.”\n\nThe chief sat there, grinning impudently at him, still mangling the fat stogie between his wide lips. Joe threw up his shoulders in a tired gesture, and walked out.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nThe Show Must Go On\n\nHe hadn’t told Marie anything, but she noticed. That tension was in him, working away all the time, making its presence felt in small signs that reached the surface.\n\n“Joe what’s wrong?” she said. “What’s the matter?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Joe, were you threatened again? Did that man—”\n\n“Honey, everything’s all right. Honest. Now, don’t you worry your pretty little head over nothing.”\n\nHe got his gun out of mothballs, the one he’d picked up on the other side, during his Army service, and he took it down to the studio, had it in his coat pocket as he rehearsed the new show for that evening.\n\nHe ate his light dinner in the luncheonette down on the street level, with Alec Thornbush. He kept looking around, as he nibbled at the food, and Alec said shrewdly, “What’s eating you, pal? What’s with this hunted man act?”\n\n“I dunno. Working too hard, I guess. Just nerves, Alec”\n\nThat satisfied Alec They got up and Alec picked up the check for both of them, and walked toward the cashier’s cage with it Joe tarried to leave a tip, got up, and almost bumped into a man with a bat pulled down over his forehead, wearing glasses, a man who bore a striking resemblance to Buddy Burton, of TV fame.\n\n“Hello,” Joe said.\n\n“Get sick,” the man suggested. “Throw up or something. Don’t go on tonight, pal.”\n\n“I’m show folk. There’s a tradition. The show must go on,” Joe said slowly.\n\n“I’ll stick around,” the man said. “I’ll be right here, in the building. I guess you know how things stand, pal.”\n\n“Who was that?” Alec asked, as Joe joined him.\n\n“Just a guy, Alec.” Joe glanced at his watch. “Getting toward show time. Let’s get up there”\n\nThe clock in the studio said a quarter of the hour. Joe Caterisano, or Buddy Burton, faced the TV cameras and exchanged a few lines of banter with the announcer, Ben Barlow, and with Kitty Anderson, his feminine guest star. He sang a song and the studio audience, the far greater audience watching his image on TV sets throughout the city, noticed a strangeness in his manner as he sang this evening.\n\nHe was obviously tense. His gestures were jerky.\n\nWhen the big red hand moved past the hour and the fifteen-minute show was over, Joe suddenly turned to Ben Barlow, and snapped, “You think you’re pretty smart, don’t you Ben?”\n\nThe portly announcer stared at him. “What’s the matter with you, kid? Are you nuts?”\n\n“You loused me up on my lines,” Joe gritted at the startled announcer. I’m wise to you, Ben. Tryin’ to make me look bad. I’m onto your game. You never did like me, did you?”\n\n“Kid,” Ben Barlow said smoothly, trying to put a pudgy hand across Joe’s shoulders and steer him off stage, away from the startled eyes of the studio audience, “you’re kind of mixed up. You—”\n\n“Take your hands off me!” Joe said. He had the gun out of his pocket. “I don’t like you either, Ben. You know why?” he said, pointing the gun right at the popeyed announcer. “You look like a Kraut. That’s what you look like to me, a Kraut.”\n\n“Kid, kid,” Barlow said weakly. “Take it easy. You’re upset. You—”\n\n“Shut up,” Joe said. He heard stealthy footsteps behind him and wheeled to see Alec Thornbush sneaking up on him. “Back off,” Joe grated, “before I have to plug somebody with this thing. It’s been a long time, but I guess I still have the knack of it.”\n\nAlec Thornbush stood still, not breathing. He appeared to have lost all desire to play the hero.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nRunning\n\nJoe half-ran from the television stage, brandishing the gun with the air of a man who itched to kill somebody with it. He raced toward the hallway. The receptionist stared at him. She wore glasses.\n\n“Why, Mr. Burton—”\n\n“Baby, give me those glasses.”\n\n“Whatever—”\n\n“The glasses, baby. The glasses.”\n\nHe let her see the gun. She seemed to freeze for a moment. Slowly, like a person confronting a deadly snake, she slipped the glasses off and handed them to him.\n\nOn the way out of the reception room he paused beside a coat-and-hat rack long enough to appropriate a tan coat and a tan hat to match it. He ran out into the hallway just as Jimmy stopped at that floor with the number five elevator.\n\nA man started to step out, but backed up quickly, staring at the gun Joe brandished. Joe followed him into the elevator, pointed the gun at Jimmy, and said, “Take her down a floor or two, kid.”\n\n“Hey,” the kid gulped. “What kind of a gag is this, Mr. Burton? That thing looks real. Quit pointing it—”\n\n“Let’s go down a floor or two Jimmy. Nice and easy.”\n\n“But—”\n\n“You heard me all right, didn’t you, Jimmy?” Joe asked.\n\nJimmy looked at the gun. Jimmy said, “Yes, sir. Okay, Mr. Burton. Down, nice and easy.”\n\n“Look here,” snapped the man Joe had backed into the elevator, “you can’t—”\n\nHe was a portly, red-faced man with an officious manner. Joe pointed the gun at him and said, “Shut up, please.”\n\nThe man gulped. His mouth closed and he was sullenly silent.\n\n“Stop here, between floors,” Joe suggested. “We’ll sit awhile, Jimmy.”\n\n“Okay, Mr. Burton,” the kid said placatingly. He stopped and they stood quietly in the motionless elevator for perhaps three minutes. The portly man’s face grew increasingly sullen, but he didn’t say anything.\n\n“All right,” Joe said. “Street level, Jimmy.”\n\nThe kid took him down. He walked out into the tiled corridor, with the glasses in place over his eyes, the hat brim turned down over his brow, the gun in his hand hidden under the topcoat he had borrowed.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nA Gun In His Hand\n\nThe man came over from the other side of the newsstand and stood nonchalantly beside him. Jimmy had hurriedly closed the door of the elevator behind Joe, taking his important passenger up where he’d intended to go in the first place.\n\nThe man said, close to Joe’s ear, “Pal, you should’ve known better.” His voice was almost plaintive.\n\n“It’s in my blood,” Joe said. “I just had to do it.”\n\n“What’s the gag with the glasses? And that hat you’re wearing. It don’t even fit you, pal…Walk, friend. I’m focused on you.”\n\n“You’re taking a chance, aren’t you?” Joe stalled, and he was wondering how long it would take them to get here. A phone call from up above there shouldn’t take more than a matter of seconds, and the cops had radios in all their prowl cars, didn’t they? A guy gone berserk, with a gun in his hand, should rate faster action than he seemed to be getting. “You can’t get away with this,” he said.\n\n“Walk, pal.”\n\n“Maybe I called in the cops. Maybe they’ve got the building staked out.”\n\n“Walk.”\n\n“Maybe I don’t even walk. Then what?”\n\n“You’re makin’ me nervous, Caterisano. Walk.”\n\nBehind them, an elevator’s doors opened, and passengers disgorged from it. “There he is,” somebody said, and some of the hardier souls edged carefully across the tiles toward Joe and his nameless companion.\n\n“Which one?” somebody was gasping. “Which one is Burton?”\n\n“Pal,” the man hissed at Joe’s ear, “you been up to something. I—”\n\nThe first cop came in then. He must have been an excitable rookie. He came barging in with his gun out, just asking for trouble from an armed man gone berserk.\n\nThe man at Joe’s side swore gutterally and shot through his coat pocket. The cop groaned and went down.\n\nJoe knew he was almost certainly next in line for it, and he acted upon instincts developed during his hitch in the Army. He shot the man, his gun still hidden under the topcoat draped over his right arm.\n\nHe hit his man in the chest, mindful of the crowd in the corridor, of the very real danger to all those present. The man went down like a stone, coughing and gasping.\n\nJoe kicked the gun out of his fingers, dropped his own gun, and the tan coat he had used to conceal its presence, and lifted his hands high as more of the cops spilled into the building.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nThanks For The Publicity\n\n“All right,” the chief said, disgruntled. “I guess I you an apology, kid. That dumb rookie, O’Hara, will live, and it could be he owes his life to you. The corpse could be your twin brother, so that proves you were telling me a straight story.”\n\n“Who was he?” Joe asked.\n\n“John Davis,” the chief sighed. “Accordin’ to the identification card in his wallet. We got nothing in our records to tab him, and that checks with the story you said he told you. One of those smarties. A top operator, but working alone. I guess you did the public a service when you plugged him,” the chief admitted, somewhat grudgingly, it seemed to Joe.\n\n“But did you have to be so melodramatic about it? Where was the need of staging that nut act, up in the studio?”\n\n“You wouldn’t listen to me,” Joe grinned. “I had to do something drastic. You put the bug in my bonnet, Chief. I really ought to thank you for that.”\n\n“Don’t thank me for nothing,” the chief snapped. “I still don’t like crooners.”\n\n“Well, thanks for the publicity, anyway,” Joe grinned. “I’ll get a big play from the papers, on this. And a sponsor, if I know the radio business. Be seeing you on your TV set, Chief.”\n\nHe turned his back on the chief, who was muttering into the mangled stogie, and went out to his car. He drove pretty fast, on the way out to Jersey.\n\nMarie would be waiting up, to hear all about it, and they always garbled things on those newscasts.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

That&#39;s what really led up to all my trouble. Fear of something altogether vague, if you know what I mean; and although I didn&#39;t know what it was I feared, I felt all the time that I must keep on doing something about it.\n\n&quot;Bright company alleviated it — parties, hijinks. That meant getting into debt, of course. After which I tried to raise money by gambling — with the usual results.\n\n&quot;I hope that gives you some idea of what led up to my stealing sixty pounds from my bank, Mr. Hawke. I knew a way of juggling with the accounts that would enable me to replace the money later.&quot;\n\nDixon Hawke nodded.\n\n&quot;I became friendly with Captain Harcourt, of Daneford House, Chilhampton,&quot; Thorpe continued. &quot;He had plenty of money, and attracted a Bohemian crowd about him.\n\n&quot;I met a bunch of them at a roadhouse in Chilhampton, and was carted up to Daneford House, almost, it seemed, as a matter of course. I was dazzled by it all. There was a good-looking girl there who seemed to take an interest in me, and — &quot;\n\n&quot;And roulette was introduced,&quot; put in Hawke.\n\n&quot;Yes, and after I&#39;d lost, some of the crowd made jokes about how easily I might get hold of money, being a bank clerk.\n\n&quot;Last Thursday, Harcourt was throwing a big all-night party to celebrate a shipping deal he&#39;d brought off, and two of the crowd, Jack Silkin and Bill Rogers, undertook to pick me up in their car outside my bank at 10:30 p.m.\n\n&quot;I waited there until half-past eleven, but no car turned up, and so I phoned Harcourt&#39;s house. Silkin answered, and apologised for having forgotten the date. He told me to come on down by taxi, and then rang off.\n\n&quot;There were no taxis about the Milvale Road district, and, in any case, the trip would have been too expensive for me, so I went home.\n\n&quot;Next morning I was arrested, and I then learned that Mr. Wilson, the manager of my bank, had been murdered, and that Lady Clinton&#39;s jewelry had been stolen from the strong-room. It seems that the manager, who lived in the flat over the bank, had been awakened by some noise in the night, and had gone downstairs to investigate.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hawke, &quot;and they found your driving-license on his body. If it had been on the floor underneath his body it wouldn&#39;t have been quite such a strong clue, since you might have dropped it there during the day, but it was on top, resting on his hip, as though it had fallen there after you had bludgeoned him.&quot;\n\nThe detective sat abstractedly rubbing his hands for a moment.\n\n&quot;The fact of your having been seen loitering near the bank at the material time weighs against you,&quot; he went on.\n\n&quot;On the other hand, it&#39;s conceivable that the appointment outside the bank was part of a plan to lend strength to the implication provided by the driving-license — assuming that to have been planted there, and not dropped by you.&quot;\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t know I&#39;d lost it,&quot; said Thorpe, &quot;not having had occasion to produce it for some time past.&quot;\n\n&quot;It may have been taken from you at one of those parties, when you were a trifle the worse for liquor. A pattern of your bank keys may have been obtained in the same way.&quot;\n\nAfter a few further questions Hawke took his leave of Thorpe, and, with his assistant at the wheel of his car, was presently on his way to Captain Harcourt&#39;s house.\n\n&quot;All I have to tell you,&quot; said Harcourt, when the detective had stated his business, &quot;is the same as I have told the police, namely, that I cannot give an account of my guests. I have been acting in a free-and-easy and undoubtedly foolish way, and invariably there have been almost as many gatecrashers as invited people at my parties.\n\n&quot;It has taught me a lesson,&quot; Harcourt added. &quot;I&#39;m quite prepared to believe that there were undesirables here who encouraged Thorpe to rob his bank, though I hope he doesn&#39;t suggest that I did so.&quot;\n\n&quot;No, he does not,&quot; said Hawke. &quot;And your point is that these people who led Thorpe astray are strangers to you, although they may have met Thorpe here, under your roof.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s the way of it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, Tommy,&quot; said Hawke as they drove away from the house, &quot;what d&#39;you think of it? A place that&#39;s visited by all and sundry wants watching, don&#39;t you think?&quot;\n\nBefore returning to town the detective had a long interview with the Chilhampton postmaster and general storekeeper.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Intercepted Messages\n\nThe next development came eight days later when Hawke, looking somewhat rueful, walked into the study and informed Tommy Burke that his inquiries had led him to an unfriendly and uncouth garage proprietor in an East End thoroughfare called Carson Street.\n\n&quot;I learned from a cafe that a young lady had been putting one of those shipping calls through to Daneford House. She had been seen to enter that garage, over which there is a house.\n\n&quot;Johnson&#39;s Garage, it is called. I approached a big man in dungarees, and asked him if he was Mr. Johnson. He said he was, and he became almost menacing when I mentioned the young lady. He denied all knowledge of her existence.\n\n&quot;The young lady, as described by the cafe proprietress, tallies with the description which Thorpe gave of the one he met at the party.&quot;\n\n&quot;Shipping messages, you said?&quot; queried Tommy.\n\nHawke settled down at his desk, and dragged a sheaf of papers before him.\n\n&quot;I persuaded the Chilhampton postmaster to make a note of all telephone conversations with Daneford House, and also to note the postmarks and times of posting of all letters for delivery there,&quot; he explained.\n\nAfter glancing thoughtfully over his documents, Hawke went on:\n\n&quot;He has sent me daily reports, and I find that a large proportion of the incoming phone calls relate to shipping matters, and come from different numbers in the East End.\n\n&quot;A couple of days ago I discovered something odd about the shipping messages. Listen to this one, for instance: &#39;Alvantara arrived berth fifteen, C dock, this morning. No tugboats now available. Cargo OK.&#39;\n\n&quot;Looking over Lloyds&#39; list, Tommy, I find that, on that day, the Alvantara was not in any dock at all, but was at sea, five hundred miles off Buenos Aires.&quot;\n\n&quot;That certainly is queer, sir.&quot;\n\n&quot;I found the same characteristic about all the other shipping messages. Also, there was this repeated reference to tugboats. How could they be of importance in shipping deals?\n\n&quot;Furthermore, I ascertained that none of the messages came from any shipping office, but from post offices, call-boxes, cafes, public-houses, and underground stations, all within a comparatively small area in the Bow Road district.&quot;\n\n&quot;Perhaps,&quot; suggested Tommy, &quot;it&#39;s some kind of a code! &quot;\n\nHawke nodded.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s nothing illegal about using a code, of course. It could be a code relating to business. Anyhow, I set myself to trace the sender of those messages, and that line of inquiry has taken me to Johnson&#39;s Garage. I&#39;d like you to put in as much time as you can watching that place, Tommy. There&#39;s a lodging-house opposite. You might get a front bed-sitting-room there.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nHawke Shows His Hand\n\nTommy reported on his activities the following afternoon.\n\n&quot;I saw that girl, sir,&quot; he said. &quot;Also an older woman and two fellows.&quot;\n\nTommy stopped talking and stared inquiringly at his employer, who was showing signs of suppressed excitement.\n\n&quot;This,&quot; said Hawke, holding up a sheet of notepaper, &quot;is another report, from the Chilhampton postmaster. It concerns a message which was telephoned to Daneford House from Carson Street Post Office last night. The message was: &#39;A new tugboat arrived at C dock at 3.20 this afternoon. An inquiry was made about the Empress. I don&#39;t think it will come to anything.&#39;&quot;\n\n&quot;What&#39;s the street number of Johnson&#39;s Garage?&quot; asked Hawke, after reading the message.\n\n&quot;Fifteen,&quot; said Tommy.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s it, then! You see, I called there at 3.20, and my visit is undoubtedly what the message refers to. Those ships aren&#39;t ships at all, but the code-names of people, the Empress, for instance, being that girl. &#39; C dock &#39; means Carson Street, and &#39; berth fifteen &#39; is Johnson&#39;s Garage. I&#39;ve interpreted &#39; tugboat &#39; as meaning a police officer, and the obvious inference is that the garage is a criminals&#39; hideout.\n\n&quot;Using those few key words,&quot; Hawke continued, &quot;I&#39;ve made considerable progress in deciphering those other messages. Assuming that &#39;cargo&#39; means loot, the messages would seem to refer to a series of thefts and the comings and goings of various members of a gang.&quot;\n\nHawke decided to take a bold line.\n\n&quot;Our chief concern,&quot; he argued, &quot;is to upset the evidence against Thorpe, and we start doing that the moment we can connect Harcourt with any kind of criminal activity. Once we&#39;ve got him on the run, Thorpe is safe.&quot;\n\nLater that afternoon Hawke and Tommy visited the East End garage and confronted Johnson.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m acting for an insurance company interested in some jewels which were stolen from the Milvale Road branch of the Southern Joint Bank,&quot; said Hawke, &quot;and, incidentally, I&#39;m interested in the man Thorpe who&#39;s charged with the robbery and with the murder of his manager.\n\n&quot;Until a few hours ago,&quot; he proceeded, &quot;the only serious weakness in the case against Thorpe was the fact that the jewels have not been recovered, but I&#39;ve now managed to unearth some other important facts.&quot;\n\nThe big man in the dungarees was leaning on one stiffly outstretched arm, the palm of his large hand resting on the distempered wall.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s all this got to do with me?&quot; he demanded in a hoarse, grating voice.\n\n&quot;I may as well tell you that I know you are connected with the gang responsible for that crime, and that their arrest is only a matter of hours. If you want to help yourself — &quot;\n\nBut the man was shrewd.\n\n&quot;Here,&quot; he said. &quot;What&#39;s the idea of putting up a proposition like that? If I want to help meself! Huh! I&#39;m now supposed to spill out all the evidence you want, I s&#39;pose? You ain&#39;t got a thing on me an&#39; you&#39;re tryin&#39; a bluff.&quot;\n\nBut he stiffened abruptly when Hawke quietly mentioned the Alvantara and the Empress.\n\n&quot;Our car ready?&quot; inquired a voice from outside.\n\nTommy nudged his employer.\n\n&quot;Here come those two I told you about.&quot;\n\nTwo men had entered the garage and had pulled down the wooden sliding shutter which closed the entrance.\n\nHawke was a little too late in realising that the palm of Johnson&#39;s hand had been covering a bell push, connected with the house upstairs.\n\nThe inquiry about the car — a large saloon, which stood in the centre of the floor — was a pretext to allay the visitors&#39; suspicions until they found themselves prisoners.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Deadly Fumes\n\nThe interior of the garage darkened as the shutter rolled down.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t move, brother,&quot; said one of the men. He spoke with a nasal intonation, and advanced on Hawke, gripping an automatic pistol.\n\nJohnson was murmuring earnestly to the other man.\n\n&quot;Anyway,&quot; he concluded, &quot;they&#39;ve got to stay hidden while we duck out of it.\n\n&quot;Tie &#39;em up,&quot; he instructed in a louder voice.\n\nUnder the threat of the automatic, Hawke and Tommy submitted to the tying-up, which was done with savage efficiency. They were flung on to the floor at the back of the garage.\n\nThe three men went out by a back door, and the prisoners heard feet pounding up the steps at the side of the garage which led to the living-quarters overhead.\n\nThen Johnson returned, actuated by an afterthought — a most disagreeable afterthought.\n\nHe stepped into the saloon car and started the engine.\n\nIt ran almost silently, but Hawke and Tommy were made aware of it by the fumes from the exhaust.\n\nAs soon as Johnson had gone upstairs, Hawke was wriggling madly in an effort to escape from his bonds.\n\nThe ropes which bound his legs and arms cut into his flesh, and refused to give in the slightest degree. Nor were Tommy and he able to assist one another; and it seemed that the deadly fumes, which quickly pervaded the confined space, must soon overcome them.\n\nThe only movement the detective could make was to roll along the ground, and, in desperation, he did so.\n\nWriggling in this way to the door by the driver&#39;s seat, he twisted over on his shoulders and thrust his feet up the side of the car.\n\nA length of cord running from his ankles to his neck prevented him from stretching his legs out full length, and he failed to reach the door-handle by several inches.\n\nHe hitched up a little closer, and, straining up on his shoulders, with his head bent almost at right angles to his body, he was able to grip the edge of the running-board with his fingers.\n\nExercising all his strength, he pulled himself up until he was literally standing on his head.\n\nThen he managed to operate the door-handle with his toes, although the effort caused the cord to press painfully deep into his neck.\n\nAs the door swung open, he was forced off his balance and he turned a somersault, coming down with jarring force on his knees.\n\nOnce more he resumed his frantic wriggling, his objective being the hand-throttle on the wheel.\n\nIt was a rather less difficult matter to get into the car than to open the door. First getting in a sitting posture on the running-board, he managed to raise himself to the driving-seat, from which position he leaned forward in an attempt to close the throttle with his chin.\n\nHis eye caught the gear-lever and he paused.\n\nSuddenly he heard footsteps descending the stairs, as the toe of his right foot came in contact with the clutch-pedal.\n\nWith the clutch depressed, he leaned forward and pressed his forehead against the ball top of the gear-lever, pushing it into bottom gear.\n\nAt this juncture the rear door opened.\n\n&quot;Where is he? Look! In the car. Quick! &quot;\n\nAs someone came scrambling round the side of the car, Hawke was trying to reach the accelerator with his heel. To have released the clutch would have thrown a strain on the slowly-running engine, which would have stopped it, thus defeating his purpose.\n\nA heavy hand descended on his shoulder just as he touched the accelerator with the very edge of his heel. The engine purred into vigorous life.\n\nThere was a shouted curse as the car jerked forward, and then a tremendous crash as the shutter gave way before the impact of the car.\n\nGlass showered everywhere as, amid excited shouts, the vehicle wrenched the shutter from its frame, pulling out bricks and plaster, and finished its career against a lamp-post outside.\n\nWhen a passing policeman saw the bound man inside the car, the game was up with the Johnson gang.\n\nThey turned and ran, but did not get far.\n\nA subsequent search of their belongings brought to light letters and a code-book which incriminated the occupant of Daneford House as the head of a gang, of which a dozen members were duly arrested.\n\nHarcourt had set himself up as a lavish host to strangers, both as a means of getting information, and in order to be able to disclaim any troublesome association with &quot;undesirables&quot; which might arise.\n\nLoyalty was assured by means of terrorism, exercised by the gunman who had threatened Hawke and Tommy, and who, on the evidence of his former confederates, was convicted of the murder of the bank manager.\n\nThorpe, shrewdly judged for the fool he was at the time, had been carefully and elaborately &quot;framed,&quot; and would very probably have gone to the gallows, but for Hawke&#39;s part in the case.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

I am a nut on crime detection, about which I know very little, and am crazier still about airplanes, concerning which I know even less. It is fortunate, I presume, that I have a couple of trick eyes which make it quite impossible for me to fly, else I&#39;d long ago have been picked up on a blotter or carried away in a small wheelbarrow after a sensational crack-up.\n\nMy spectacles are the bar between me and aviation; they are shell-rimmed affairs, which make me look like a wise owl of sorts and add to the resemblance between me and the eight ball above referred to. I weigh two hundred and ten pounds, stripped, and have a mania for sticking my snub nose into other people&#39;s business, and every time I do it something unforeseen happens.\n\nIt&#39;s this way: I wasn&#39;t born with a silver spoon in my mouth; but a paternal uncle left me some money right after I left school, and I guess there must have been quite a bit of it, since none of my checks has ever come back marked &quot;insufficient funds&quot; — and I&#39;m always writing &#39;em.\n\nI have a sizeable interest in an airport in the thriving city of San Diego, and one of the De Havillands is always in readiness for my use. I don&#39;t fly it myself, unless we are so high up in the air that the real pilot has enough time to take her over and straighten her out before we hit earth after some idiotic mistake of mine; hut I always get a terrific kick out of acting as the unofficial observer in the rear cockpit, where I consider myself monarch of all I survey.\n\nAll of which rambling leads up to the fact that I believe that airplanes and crime dovetail in many ways. Crooks use &#39;em as well as honest men. From this I figure that there is, ready-made, a niche for a brand new kind of detective — of which, as far as I know, I am among the first. Having modestly got that off my chest I shall now proceed with the story.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nBank Robbery\n\nAt three o&#39;clock exactly, on Friday afternoon last, just as the street door was closing after a busy day in the Merchants&#39; County Bank, which is about eight blocks south of Broadway, in the southeastern portion of San Diego, a quietly dressed stranger stepped inside and moved nonchalantly to the public desk as though to make out a check. Since he had managed to squeeze in before the door closed, the courteous bank employees allowed him to go about his business. They closed the door, however, so that no one else could get in.\n\nThe men in the cages were arranging their piles of banknotes in orderly rows, preparatory to locking them up in the vault. A middle-aged woman, with a child by her side, stood at the desk beside the man who had just got through the doors. Her face was covered with a heavy veil, and she was dressed in black. Every once in a while she thrust a slender white hand under her veil, as though she wiped away an unseen tear.\n\nThe man who had forced the doors finished writing his check and moved to the cashier&#39;s window. As far as later investigations proved, he paid no attention to the woman in black at the desk he had just left, nor did he once look toward the door, through whose glass the street, with its passing crowds, could be plainly seen. He stepped to the window and thrust his check through with his left hand. His right hand rested on the marble rectangle outside the cage. Or, rather, the side pocket of his coat rested on the rectangle, and his right hand was hidden in the pocket.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t really want to cash this check, buddy,&quot; he said conversationally; &quot;but I do want all the money you&#39;re wallowing in back there! And I&#39;ll drill you if I don&#39;t get it!&quot;\n\nThe cashier didn&#39;t say a word. He was tongue-tied. He hadn&#39;t strength enough even to lift his hands. The bandit continued:\n\n&quot;Listen, carefully, son. There are only four officials in this bank besides yourself. I&#39;m not counting the woman and the kid. I can take care of them. Call the other four inside your cage, and if anything in your voice makes them suspicious of me. I&#39;ll drill you.&quot;\n\nThe cashier, knowing after a glance into the black eyes of the unmasked man that the bandit wouldn&#39;t hesitate to carry out his threat, immediately raised his voice in a carefully modulated call to the four employees mentioned. These came hurriedly, a bit impatient at this new delay. The bandit waited until they had all entered the cage.\n\n&quot;Put &#39;em up!&quot; he commanded tersely. &quot;I know you&#39;ve got a gat or a sawed-off shotgun under the desk, but if any one of you makes a break for it he gets a bullet in him. Now, Mr. Cashier, take this cord and bind their hands.&quot;\n\nAll of this in an ordinary tone of voice, so that the woman in the veil hadn&#39;t even looked around. The bank officials were scared green. The cashier bound his colleagues effectively, the wrists of each behind his back. At a low word of command from the bandit the five were herded into the huge vault in rear of the bank. The woman looked up just as the bound men came into view from behind the cages. The bandit, his eyes moving all about, saw her freeze to immobility.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t move, lady,&quot; he called softly. &quot;You are in no danger as long as you obey orders.&quot;\n\nThe woman turned back to her desk. The little girl, her eyes wide with childish curiosity, spoke. &quot;What&#39;s he doin&#39; to all those men, auntie?&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThree Savage Blows\n\nOutside, half a block away, a young school teacher, with her half-monthly pay check in her hand, was hurrying toward the bank. She had an understanding with the officials to the effect that, if she were no more than fifteen minutes late, they would always let her into the bank to transact business, since she never left school early enough to reach the bank before closing lime. Her mind was busy with the happenings of the day, for she was a very conscientious teacher, who had dedicated her life to the kindergarten. Her thoughts were always on her little charges, waking or sleeping. She never even thought of such things as daylight robberies, living, actually and mentally, in a world of fledgling humans.\n\nShe reached the door of the bank and tapped on the glass. No one came for a moment. She pressed her nose to the door and peered in. She saw a veiled, middle-aged lady at the check desk with a little girl, and she saw a man, a gray felt hat on his head as though he were preparing to depart, standing in the wide-open door of the great vault at the rear of the bank. Evidently she was later than she had thought. She could see figures moving inside the vault, but they were indistinct because of the shadows. The man in the door turned and beckoned to the veiled woman. She nodded, took the hand of the girl, and moved past the man into the vault.\n\nPauline Carson, the young school teacher, tapped once more on the glass. The man in the vault door turned and saw her. With quick strides he approached the door. Pauline saw that he was a stranger, and immediately thought of bank examiners, since on her last visit the cashier had told her the examiner was due shortly. The bandit opened the door, smiled courteously at the young woman, and beckoned her inside.\n\n&quot;This way, madam,&quot; he said suavely.\n\nPauline knew instantly that something was wrong, though she hadn&#39;t the ghost of an idea what it was. She stopped dead still.\n\n&quot;Where are you taking me?&quot; she demanded. &quot;Where is the cashier?&quot;\n\n&quot;He&#39;s back here,&quot; replied the bandit hurriedly. &quot;Come on!&quot;\n\nPauline allowed herself to be led to the door of the vault, inside she saw the bank officials herded together, their hands tied behind them — and the veiled woman with shaking shoulders, as though she sobbed her heart out. Of them all, the child seemed the most unconcerned. The bank robber had now dropped all pretense.\n\n&quot;Get inside, and you won&#39;t be hurt,&quot; he snapped. &quot;I am a bank robber and I&#39;m in a hurry!&quot;\n\n&quot;I won&#39;t go in there! I&#39;ll promise not to yell; but I won&#39;t go in that vault. It&#39;s air-tight.&quot;\n\nThe bank robber said no further word. He drew his weapon, which up to this lime had been inside his pocket, and struck the young woman three savage blows on the temple. She sank to the floor lumpishly, and the bank robber seized her by an ankle, dragging her to the threshold of the vault. He did not enter, however, commanding instead that the woman in the veil seize the younger woman and drag her on in.\n\nThen he closed the vault door.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Guns of the De Havillands\n\nAt three-thirty exactly I received a call from the Chief of Police.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m notifying everybody interested in crime, Smutts,&quot; he told me wildly. &quot;The fellow got away with fifteen thousand dollars! And he killed a woman!&quot;\n\nI noted with a wry grin that he mentioned the loss of the fifteen thousand before he mentioned the killing. &quot;Any description of the bandit?&quot; I asked.\n\n&quot;Yes. Under thirty. Wore no mask. Evidently a drug addict. Medium height. Light complexion. For God&#39;s sake, Smutts, help us out! The papers will ruin us if this egg gets away.&quot;\n\n&quot;Should be a pipe to find a guy like that,&quot; I retorted with fine sarcasm. &quot;Any idea which direction he went? What have you done so far?&quot;\n\n&quot;Nobody knows. The woman he slugged gave us the description before she died. She said something about seeing a little red automobile at the curb near the bank, and it wasn&#39;t there when the police arrived on the scene, fifteen minutes after the hold-up. Motorcycle police have been hurried to all outgoing roads, Los Angeles Highway, Tijuana road, La Mesa, and the Ocean and Mission beach police have been instructed to cover their roads, moving in toward town.&quot;\n\nI hung up the receiver. Then I got an idea. I called the taxicab company and asked if they had received a call for a taxi within the last half hour from anywhere near the Merchants&#39; County Bank. That business of the little red automobile didn&#39;t sound exactly right to me. A good hunch, this. A call had just come in from a drug store within three blocks of the bank. They gave me the number of the cab that had been sent. I called the Chief of Police and told him.\n\nIt was now almost four o&#39;clock, which is the regular time when our two passenger-carrying De Havillands take off for Los Angeles. I had just hung up the receiver when the roaring of the Liberties drowned out all other sounds. It is a sound one never forgets. It always thrills me. I decided to have my own &#39;plane convoy the two passenger carriers as far as Oceanside, just for the ride.\n\nI signaled to my own pet pilot. The propeller was spun by a mechanic with more nerve than I&#39;ll ever have, and I saw, for the thousandth time, a sight which always makes me feel as though I were king of the world — three sweet-singing De Havillands tugging at their blocks impatiently, wagging their tails with eagerness to be off. The propellers are invisible, almost, and dust behind the &#39;planes goes blizzarding across the avenue behind the airport, blotting from view the passing automobiles which scurry across Dutch Flats from Ocean Beach to San Diego.\n\nThen two things happen with startling suddenness. The dust behind the middle De Havilland clears for a moment, and I see an orange-colored taxicab drawn up at the curb. There is no one in it but the chauffeur, and he is staring at that middle De Havilland as though he had gone crazy. I note, with a suppressed shout of excitement, the number on the side of the taxicab, and turn to the middle De Havilland to see what it is all about.\n\nEven as I turn, the De Havilland in question, with the gun full on, the engines howling protest at tire heavens, leaps the blocks and hurtles down the field like an airplane gone mad. There is only one passenger in the &#39;plane, and this one is crouched in the rear cockpit, his right hand, holding something sinister, pressed against the neck of the pilot.\n\nThe guns of the two other &#39;planes are cut instantly. In the comparative silence I see police cars, careening like ships in a storm, swing into the avenue from both ends. The chauffeur of the taxicab holds his ground, though he is about as scared a driver as I have ever seen.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Bandit Catches The Signal\n\nI decide not to wait for the police. I am prodded into action by the beckoning hand of my pet pilot, and in a jiffy I am in the rear cockpit of my own &#39;plane, and we are sweeping into the teeth of the wind for the take-off. The &#39;plane carrying the bandit is already in the air, madly circling for altitude. My pilot knows his stuff. He lifts her nose in a savage zoom, and when he levels her off we are fifteen hundred feet high.\n\nThe &#39;plane ahead of us has straightened and pointed her nose in the general direction of Tijuana, which is so near that they may make the border before we can head &#39;em off. My &#39;plane is a fast baby, though, and when we settle on the tail of that bandit&#39;s &#39;plane we&#39;re stepping &#39;em a few, believe me. The wind shrieks through the struts and braces, and the ground below looks, for once, as though it were really moving. We are going around a hundred and forty, I judge.\n\nMy pilot lifts her again, then once more. He&#39;s trying to get above that other &#39;plane for a dive. It&#39;s no go though, that. I know. That pilot in the other &#39;plane is a friend of ours. I daren&#39;t crash him. If it were just the bandit now, and the loss of a De Havilland, that would be all right. They still honor my checks, even for enough to buy De Havillands at regular intervals. We are now six thousand feet up, and the leading &#39;plane is well below us, and we are gaining. That other pilot knows his stuff, too. Even with a gun against his neck, in the hand of a man who has shown he will use it, that pilot is still doing everything he can to delay reaching the border.\n\nThen I remember something. That pilot was supposed to make a trip to Los, which means that he has a parachute! Why didn&#39;t I think of that before? I yell at my pilot, and the wind drives the words hack into my throat until they fetch up with a thud against the soles of my feet. Dumb! Then I jab the pilot in the back and signal for him to dive. He grins at me and lifts both hands to the edge of the cowling.\n\nThat means it&#39;s my party, and I glom onto the joy-stick in my cockpit as though I really knew how to fly. Not quite so much like a rocking chair as when the real pilot is flying, but passing fair. The left wing falls away, and I over-control, causing her to wobble — and my pilot grins.\n\nI point her nose at the other &#39;plane and give her full gun. She&#39;s rather a steep dive and I don&#39;t try to bring her up, either. I&#39;m making her shake like a terrier just in out of the rain, and her struts, braces and wires are yelling bloody murder; but I&#39;m so excited about this chase that I open my mouth and yell for all I&#39;m worth, and the yell, like my shout to the pilot, darts back into my throat, chokes me and makes my eyes fill with tears.\n\nI blink &#39;em away and give her more power. We cross over the tail of the other &#39;plane just as we are above the sands of the Strand, that ribbon of concrete road which leads from Coronado southward to the Tijuana road. There is only one automobile on the road, as far as I can see.\n\nThe bandit is standing, crouched forward against the backblast of the other &#39;plane&#39;s propeller, and he shakes his weapon at us as we zip over. I guess he takes a shot at us, but I have the feeling that the bullet wouldn&#39;t catch us if we were flying dead away. And the bandit is probably too scared to shoot straight, even if he were on the ground and held his weapon in both hands. It&#39;s no snap to hit an airplane. I catch the eye of the other pilot and signal. The bandit catches the signal, hut he doesn&#39;t know what it means. I bring our &#39;plane around in a brutal, wing-menacing bank, and prepare to cross over the other &#39;plane&#39;s tail again.\n\nFor a moment we hung just above the tail of the other &#39;plane. The bandit waved his puny weapon at us savagely, and for a moment his eyes were off his own pilot. Said pilot stood up and plunged over the side. I sighed with relief when I saw the knapsack arrangement on his body. He was safe, and out of it, if his parachute opened. Personally, I&#39;m not strong for parachute jumps. Being an eight ball I&#39;d be as likely to jump and forget my parachute as not. So I&#39;ve never gone in for jumping. Some day, maybe —\n\nI saw the &#39;chute open her great wings far below the other plane. I swooped down —\n\nAnd the world suddenly turned topsy-turvy!\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA Sort Of Immelman Turn\n\nMy eyes are not too darned good, as I have said, and I dropped lower than I planned. My trucks crashed into the tail piece of the other &#39;plane, and in a shake we were turned on our back and going like blazes; but whether up, down, or sidewise I didn&#39;t know for a moment. I looked up and saw the earth, and the belt across my knees was cutting my thighs in two. But my pilot still was grinning, and his hands looked as though he were trying to pinch pieces out of the sides of the forward cockpit cowling.\n\nI looked down and saw the other &#39;plane, and it was falling up toward us. I had sense enough to give her the gun again, and the earth looked entirely too close above our heads. I motioned my pilot and, battling with the stick for a full minute, he brought her out of it in a sort of Immelman Turn. The other &#39;plane, going down in wide, lazy spirals, flipped past us, and I&#39;ll be darned if the bandit in the rear cockpit wasn&#39;t grinning! I guess he thought he was getting away with something.\n\nI prayed fervently that he would crash in such a way that there would be enough of him left to stand trial for killing Pauline Carson.\n\nThe other &#39;plane settled with unbelievable slowness, as we followed her down — and when she buried her nose in the sand along the ribbon-like Strand we kept on dropping! My pilot looked Lack at me. His face was white as parchment, as though he were suffering untold agony. He tried to lift his hands to the cowling, signaling for me to take the stick again — or so I thought.\n\nI took it — and jammed the controls! We hit the sand a quarter of a mile from where the first &#39;plane had crashed, coming down in a heap on our left wing, which crumpled like cardboard.\n\nThen the lights went out arid the sudden darkness was full of stars.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nGrinning Toothlessly\n\nWhen I opened my trick eyes there were men in uniform all around us. I felt myself over for broken bones and found I was intact, except for a broken leg and a smashed nose. I tried to talk, and my voice sounded like the mumbling of an octogenarian — which brought home to me the fact that most of my front teeth were missing. Evidently, in the crash, I had tried to bite a piece out of the forward edge of the cowling, with indifferent success. My pilot was okeh, except for a long furrow along his temple under his helmet, where, odd as it may seem, that random bullet from the bandit&#39;s pistol had creased him.\n\n&quot;Listen, Ryan,&quot; I said weakly. &quot;I have a horrible suspicion! Please look in the after cockpit of that wreck of ours and see if you can find my front teeth!&quot;\n\nThen I saw the bandit. He was manacled to a couple of policemen, while a third policeman was counting a flock of greenbacks from a bag he had just taken from the bandit. The bandit was talking.\n\n&quot;Too much dope,&quot; he said. &quot;But I&#39;d have got away with it if it hadn&#39;t been for that goggle-eyed bird there with all his teeth knocked out. But I kinda lost my nerve after I left the bank. Something told me I had hit that damned woman too hard, and it shook me. The dope wore off and I got scared as hell. If I hadn&#39;t been scared I&#39;d never have got the fool idea that I could get away in one of those &#39;planes. You damned cops don&#39;t give a man any chance whatever.&quot;\n\nInquiry brought forth the information that the pilot who had jumped from the fleeing &#39;plane had landed without mishap, save for a broken instep when he struck the concrete roadway of the Strand. Everything seemed fine and dandy, and the doctors told me I might get out of the hospital in time to attend the trial of the bank robber. I&#39;ll get a great kick out of sitting as close to him as possible, and grinning at him toothlessly.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

With a sigh of satisfaction, he plunged swiftly into the brush which skirted the roadside. There he paused, alert, until his straining ears convinced him that his movements had been unobserved. Then he made himself comfortable for his brief vigil.\n\nCrouching there, he reviewed minutely his actions so far, and his plans for what was to come. There was yet time, if he had erred, if there was a flaw, to withdraw quietly. It was merely a matter of waiting for another night. To be confronted with the damage wrought by an overlooked trifle when it was too late would be agonizing. And his very confidence disquieted him, made him feel that there was something amiss.\n\nYet he could find no weak link in his carefully forged chain. His left hand, dropping into his coat pocket, found the bottle of cyanide of potassium solution securely corked and ready to assume its role. His automatic weighed heavily in the other pocket, well oiled and loaded. The light mask which now covered the upper half of his face was really of no importance; just an extra precaution which discounted the possible, but highly improbable, intrusion of some pedestrian.\n\nThe cyanide, he felt sure, no one would be able to trace. Several weeks before he had stolen a couple of small lumps — quite enough for his purpose — from the private laboratory of a friend who rode the hobby of chemistry. Few people knew of the existence of the little attic laboratory; fewer still were aware of his acquaintance with its owner, and the man himself was ignorant of the fact that his supply had been levied on.\n\nSince the deadly stuff had been dissolved and bottled, and the bottle scrupulously cleaned, he had taken pains to avoid touching it bare handed. Right now his left hand was gloved with rubber. There would be no finger-prints to damn him.\n\nFootprints need give him no concern. The roadway was dry and reasonably hard. The discoverers of the corpse would quickly obliterate any slight clews of a definite nature that he might thus leave. The keenest of sleuths could examine the scene of his crime to their hearts&#39; content. They would learn nothing.\n\nHe had made no attempt to establish an alibi. And in this, he was satisfied, he had acted wisely. The business of trying to demonstrate that you were where you were not is, usually, a dangerous undertaking. It involves either the employment of confederates or the use of complicated subterfuges which must either function with precision or turn into veritable boomerangs. The collapsing alibi is too often the royal road to the electric chair. Ridgely knew that there was just one person who could be relied on to be forever silent on this night&#39;s work — himself. Better to take the chance of the authorities being unable to prove that he was on the spot at the time than to assume the burden of proving that he was not.\n\nAnd, anyway, most of the precautions he had taken were no doubt unnecessary. They represented merely his forethought in forestalling unlooked for disaster before it occurred. The chances were that the case would be looked on as just what it seemed on the surface — suicide. There would probably be little more than a perfunctory inquiry, an inquest at which every fact produced would seem to demonstrate conclusively that the man took his own life. Ridgely prided himself that the idea of killing a man by forcing him to kill himself was a master stroke.\n\nA man found dead on the road, dead from the effects of poison, and with the bottle containing that poison clutched tightly in his stiffened hand, is obviously a suicide. There is no reason to suspect foul play unless someone is known to have a strong motive for putting the unfortunate one out of the way. And, to the best of Ridgely&#39;s knowledge and belief, Maury hadn&#39;t an enemy in the world — save himself.\n\nAnd, thanks to his consistent and flawless dissimulation, his secret was his own. Outwardly he had been quite friendly with Maury. Not too friendly — just enough so to he counted really indifferent. In the rare event of murder being suspected and a murderer sought for, there would be no reason for alarm.\n\nOne other only might possibly connect him with the night&#39;s events. Maury&#39;s wife! Jean Maury and Ridgely shared a rather guilty secret. She could assign to him a motive. But here again he was confident that perfect technique had practically nullified the danger of aroused suspicion. By guarding every word, by well planned and controlled actions, he had assured her belief that he — like herself — was a harmless flirt. Not once had she been permitted to glimpse the terrible passion that was his; never had she been allowed to plumb the depths of his crafty and daring nature. He was safe on that score. Under the pretence of carefully guarding her reputation he had concealed their affair from outsiders, and to her herself he had made the matter, seem trivial.\n\nThere was one circumstance, however, that might cause comment. And as he thought of it, Ridgely grinned. While it was true that no one, apparently, had a motive for slaying Maury, it was equally true that the man had no apparent motive for killing himself. Happy, care-free, comfortably wealthy and well satisfied with life, people might wonder that he should court death.\n\nRidgely grinned. For it was to this, to his mind, the weakest point of his whole coup, that he had devoted the most thought, expended the greatest effort. He had supplied the motive! Here was the artistic triumph of the whole thing. Here was the finishing touch.\n\nFor the suspicions of the authorities would be allayed before they were aroused. During the three months that he had known the Maurys he had quietly, unobtrusively collected specimens of John Maury&#39;s handwriting. And by diligent practice he had enabled himself to imitate the man&#39;s scrawl so perfectly that he had no fear of the fraud being detected. Not only the writing itself had he studied minutely, but the style, the tricks of speech. Beyond doubt, the missive he had evolved with so much care would pass unquestioned as the dead man&#39;s own work.\n\nHe drew forth an envelope, and by the light of his electric torch scrutinized with pride and satisfaction the letter he had written. The envelope was addressed to Mrs. John Maury:\n\nMy Dear Jean:\n\nI am sorry, terribly sorry, for the notoriety this thing will cause. I realize that you will be shocked. I am asking your forgiveness. For four years I have suffered in silence, Jean, for our marriage was a bitter mistake. I did not love you. I realized it when it was too late. I&#39;ve done my best to conceal the fact from you, but I know I could not go on living a lie much longer. I am taking the easiest way out. It is only just that I should suffer for my own sin.\n\nJohn.\n\nAs he replaced the letter in its envelope, Ridgely chuckled. He would place this missive in the man&#39;s pocket after he had fallen, and there was the motive all ready to satisfy the most critical. Scandal-loving eyes scanning Maury&#39;s past for sensational disclosures of his implied double life would not dwell too closely on the method of his taking off. Furnish —\n\nHe stiffened. The soft thud of moving feet on the hard road reached his ears, growing steadily louder. He knew it was Maury. The moment had come!\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nKnockout Drops\n\nRidgely&#39;s hand closed resolutely over his automatic. Maury, he knew, was unarmed. He slipped soundlessly to the very edge of the copse and waited until the approaching form was only a few feet from his ambush. Then he sprang out, weapon leveled, barring the way.\n\nThere was a startled oath as Maury caught sight of the ominous figure before him. Ridgely&#39;s gruff command to throw up his hands was instantly obeyed. The surprise was complete.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t speak&quot; — Ridgely rather hoped that his disguised voice would completely mask his identity, but it didn&#39;t matter, really — &quot;do as you&#39;re told. You are going to sleep for an hour or so while I clean you and make my getaway.&quot;\n\n&quot;Really,&quot; Maury was regaining his nerve, &quot;I haven&#39;t enough about me to make it worth your while — &quot;\n\n&quot;Shut up!&quot; Ridgely&#39;s command was curt, as he advanced toward his victim, the deadly bottle in his gloved left hand. He extended it toward Maury.\n\n&quot;Drink it,&quot; he growled, determinedly.\n\nMaury lowered one arm and took the bottle hesitatingly.\n\n&quot;What is it?&quot; he asked, falteringly.\n\n&quot;Chloral hydrate, if you must know,&quot; responded Ridgely, in tones of well-feigned sulkiness.\n\n&quot;Enough to put you out for a couple of hours. Knockout drops. Take your choice. Drink it, and go out for a couple of hours, or — &quot; he waved the automatic suggestively, &quot;go out for keeps.&quot;\n\n&quot;Look here,&quot; began Maury, &quot;I&#39;ll promise — &quot;\n\n&quot;Drink it!&quot; Ridgely snapped, savagely.\n\nWithout further parley Maury raised the bottle to his lips. It was only an instant, really, but to Ridgley, waiting anxiously, it seemed hours before the body crumpled to the roadway. Then, swiftly, he went to his victim, pocketing his automatic. His gloved hand inserted the letter into Maury&#39;s pocket, he noted that the bottle was tightly gripped in the dead man&#39;s hand, and noiselessly he stole away from the place.\n\nA short cut through a little woodland brought him out onto a main road. Without haste he wended his way toward the summer hotel. He was jubilant. Maury was out of his way. He had only to wait the proper moment to increase the ardor of his courting. He felt that the widow would lend an attentive ear.\n\nHe passed no one on the road. Everything was coming his way. As he gained his room unobserved he was whistling softly. Not a pang of remorse came to sear his conscience. Ridgely wasn&#39;t that kind. He turned in and slept like a top.\n\nHe was awakened by a sharp knocking on the room door. Bright sunlight was streaming in through the thinly curtained windows. A hasty glance at the clock told him that it was after ten. The knocking continued insistently.\n\nHe sprang out of bed and reached for his bathrobe.\n\n&quot;Just a minute!&quot; he called, as he hurriedly pulled a comb through his tousled hair.\n\nAn instant later, fairly presentable, he was gazing inquiringly at the tall young man who had pushed in through the partly opened door.\n\nEven before the other had introduced himself, Ridgely knew that his caller was a detective. Something must have gone wrong, he thought, and his mind went racing swiftly over the details of the evening before, seeking to find and forestall the consequences of a slip. He was not panicky.\n\nHis visitor was speaking. &quot;John Maury was found dead on the road late last night, Mr. Ridgely.&quot;\n\nRidgely carefully side-stepped a possible trap.\n\n&quot;An accident?&quot; he asked, in perfectly done surprise and concern.\n\n&quot;No,&quot; replied the other. &quot;He was murdered.&quot;\n\nRidgely concealed his dismay. How in the devil had they reached that conclusion so soon in the face of his carefully prepared evidence to the contrary?\n\n&quot;Murdered!&quot; he echoed, blankly. &quot;How? By whom?&quot;\n\nThe tall young man sat down, watching Ridgely narrowly. His right hand had dropped carelessly into his pocket. He leaned forward slightly, and spoke swiftly.\n\n&quot;By you, Mr. Ridgely,&quot; he replied, evenly. &quot;No. Don&#39;t interrupt. You set a very pretty stage, my friend, and you have been careful — careful to a fault. It was your little finishing touch that betrayed you. That, and a woman&#39;s vanity. Mrs. Maury is a very beautiful woman with a very plain name. It has been her little failing to hide that fact. Her name is not Jean, Ridgely, it&#39;s Jane. And Maury never called her anything else in private. When she saw that letter you so cleverly left she knew Maury had never written it despite the excellent forgery. For he hated the name Jean as much as she disliked Jane. She is a big enough woman to admit her own shortcomings, and — . Shall I read the warrant?&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

I tell them how it happened, and I laugh. But no one else seems to think it&#39;s funny, how I cut up Warren Burron with a hand-ax. I guess some people like their humor on the lighter side. So I&#39;m here all alone, thinking and waiting. It&#39;ll be even funnier if my lawyer, Forbes, brings me the right word. But just the way it stands now, with my possible trek to the gas chamber, that&#39;s funny enough.\n\nHere&#39;s the way it is: I killed Burron all right. But it wasn&#39;t really murder. I swung the hand-ax, but no one seems to understand when I explain how I&#39;m not the murderer. It&#39;s confusing, and Burron&#39;s voice whispering to me in the night doesn&#39;t clear things up. It&#39;s what he whispers to me that makes the joke complete. But nobody understands.\n\nIn trying to explain it, I start at the Union Station where Mrs. Burron picked me up that afternoon. I start there because that was where I should have stopped.\n\nEva had always been something special to look at. She hadn&#39;t changed. I stared, and Eva&#39;s eyes clouded and her lips quivered. Her voice was thick, the kind that can make an icicle hot. She was streamlined and moved like a cat. Her skin was like polished copper, and her hair like shiny blue-black ink spilling over that skin. Her eyes always seemed to burn, not bright, but deep and warm like smoldering coals in a fireplace.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Sucker For Temptation\n\nI didn&#39;t know why yet, but Burron had invited me up to his twenty-room cottage at Big Bear. Just Burron and his wife and I. A cozy threesome. I&#39;d accepted. I was sick. I&#39;d gotten a brain concussion in a football game. I felt all right, except for an occasional ache. I told him that, and that I&#39;d appreciate the opportunity for a nice long rest. I&#39;d decided to drop out of my senior year at the U. I&#39;d forgotten, almost, about Eva whom I&#39;d known quite well at school six years before. That was where she&#39;d met Burron.\n\nI knew my acceptance was a mistake as soon as Eva met me at the station. Alone. Just Eva and that big black convertible of Warren&#39;s. My name is Will Gardner. It isn&#39;t St. Anthony. I guess Burron knew I was a sucker for temptation. He had it all figured out. How easy it would be to murder me.\n\nEva drove that big torpedo through the damp night with a kind of fierce determination. Her long body was at ease, her lush legs sprawled easily. But her face was tense. Muscles broke the smooth copper of her throat and made lines run down to the corners of her mouth. She kept the cigarette lighter busy.\n\nSo far, we hadn&#39;t exchanged over a dozen words. While we made verbal sounds, our eyes and our minds had been speaking another language. More easily understood, but the kind that&#39;s better kept off the record. A kind of universal language that&#39;s far superior to Esperanto.\n\nHer hand dropped to my knee. I shivered, and it was like I&#39;d blundered into a high tension wire. My voice wasn&#39;t very calm.\n\n&quot;Lay off,&quot; I think I said, or something equally absurd.\n\nHer laughter wasn&#39;t absurd. It was sort of high and desperate and nervous. I could see her lips curl in a crooked red arch in the light from the dash. A sudden sharp warning of pain shot through my head.\n\nShe said, &quot;Don&#39;t make me laugh any more, Will. I&#39;m not in the laughing mood tonight.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not trying to be amusing,&quot; I said. &quot;I mean it. I&#39;m up here to rest, to relax. And that&#39;s all. I&#39;m going to keep it clean.&quot;\n\nHer voice was shrill. It had a throaty electric undertone, like a cat&#39;s cry. &quot;You didn&#39;t have any idea of seeing me at all!&quot;\n\nI said, no. But it didn&#39;t ring true. I meant it, but I didn&#39;t know. I&#39;m no introspectionist. I&#39;ve never bothered about what my unconscious was doing to me. Let some big-lettered name do it, for fifty bucks an hour. But not with me. Not now. It&#39;s too late now to start, at any price. And I understand it takes a few years to do it right, and I don&#39;t have nearly that much time.\n\nLet&#39;s just drop it with the remark that a guy doesn&#39;t always know what he&#39;s thinking, or even what he&#39;s saying. Or even what he&#39;s intending to do, maybe the very next minute, or hour, or day.\n\nThe car went faster, around those hair-pin turns up the mountains to Big Bear. To my right, I saw the sprawling panorama of L. A., way down in a fogged pocket that seemed as endless as the Universe. Warm rain began to splatter on the glass. The windshield wipers started a soft humming pattern.\n\nShe said, &quot;I suppose you accepted the invitation, just to talk with Warren? Just to sit in front of the fire and be intellectual! Be intellectual as hell!&quot;\n\nI didn&#39;t answer that. I&#39;d never been able to be intellectual, with Warren Burron or anyone else. And she was right. I remembered Burron. You might call Burron a dilettante, whatever that means. He never did anything. He just appreciated things, that&#39;s what he always said. And that&#39;s how he and I had gotten acquainted. To Burron, athletes, particularly big men, were phenomena worthy of appreciation. We&#39;d gotten to be good friends during my sophomore year. And only because Burron said he was trying to figure out what made the physical type of human being function in a modern, so-called mental age.\n\nThat was Burron. Not a snob, as I remembered. But something above even the snob. A small gaunt watery-eyed guy with a penchant for studying things. An appreciator, and a kind of bystander. He explored, and examined, and analyzed. I had been one of his objects of investigation. When he became interested in some particular subject, whether it was cubism, or Mayan culture, he threw himself into it right up to the roots of his mousy hair.\n\nAfter I got to his cottage at Big Bear, I found out the first night what his latest and absorbing interest was, and I wished I had never come.\n\nIt was Death. It was Death and Suicide, and Murder. And all in poetry.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nNot The Emotional Kind\n\nBut before we got to his cottage, Eva told me a few other things about Burron. Mostly about Burron and herself. How beautifully they didn&#39;t get along together. She hated Burron, loathed and despised his very guts. But that wasn&#39;t Burron&#39;s way. Burron couldn&#39;t hate anybody. Burron wasn&#39;t the emotional kind. Hate and loathing, love and adoration (Burron said) are things to be studied.\n\nAnd long before the unpleasant conversation I had with Eva as she drove through the rain got very far, I began to get the idea. Burron had married Eva just so he could study her.\n\nAll right. Maybe you know enough about Burron now. Maybe not. It doesn&#39;t matter very much. I decided that he was insane. But that doesn&#39;t mean anything either. Ask any twenty authorities to define insanity. Compare notes. Burron doesn&#39;t fit into the notes at all. The notes don&#39;t even fit.\n\nA guy who can go on whispering to me after I chopped his head thoroughly with a hand-ax, that kind of guy can&#39;t be shoved into a pigeon-hole. Can he? A guy who dragged me up there to experiment with me and with Death. A guy who worshipped Death, and called it a &quot; … woman who is soft and sweet … and a guy who would push a nasty affair between his wife and another man, just to see if it would affect him, and to study it! A guy who loved Death … .\n\nYou figure it out. I&#39;m tired. I&#39;m sick too. I&#39;m tired and sick, and tonight, moonlight is shining through cold steel bars, and the moonlight is colder than steel.\n\nAnd Burron&#39;s whisper comes down through the moonlight.\n\n&quot;Thanks, Gardner! Thanks, very much. You made it a beautiful and complete thing, and I&#39;ll be eternally grateful to you.&quot;\n\nEva turned off the motor, doused the lights as the car coasted in and moored to a siding. It was suddenly just darkness with Eva&#39;s body and mine all wrapped up together in it, as in a blanket. It didn&#39;t seem like a shroud then. She moved over against me. I didn&#39;t play hard to get. Her voice was soft and intimate and warm. Her hair floated around my face. Her arms were moist and hot.\n\nAnd then, hardly knowing how, I rediscovered what her lips were like. Curved and full and cushiony-soft. I&#39;d never found anyone so exciting as Eva Burron. Body, voice, breath, all exciting. Pressure was building up inside me. I felt like a pressure cooker pushed up to the third red ring. My forehead was getting slippery.\n\nShe had explained about her and Burron. She said now, hotly against my ear:\n\n&quot;Now you know why I&#39;m glad to see you, Will.&quot;\n\n&quot;I know,&quot; I said.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s like a soft wet grub,&quot; she said. &quot;And all he does is look at me, and ask me questions, and make notes in his little books.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nLike A Mouse Trapped In A Maze\n\nIt was all very clear to me. No more elaboration was necessary. I was stuck in a helluva situation, that was all. I felt like a mouse trapped in a maze. And like most really effective mazes, I felt so pleasantly trapped that I didn&#39;t really know whether I was trying to get out or not, whether I even wanted to get out.\n\nAnd then a light flashed through the wet glass. Eva grinned thinly. She turned on the car lights. Burron&#39;s white wet face gazed in at us. He came around and opened the door. Small and wispy and mousy. A little grey man. I was still leaning over his wife, my arms around her, that&#39;s the way he found us.\n\nAll he said, in his low precise voice was: &quot;I&#39;ll take your suitcase, Will. That is, if you&#39;re not too busy.&quot; He didn&#39;t say it with sarcasm.\n\nIt should have been nice. We sat before the fireplace, a big fire made out of big crackling logs. There was the strong smell of red cedar wood, and pine needles, and the smell of fresh wet rain. But it wasn&#39;t nice. It wasn&#39;t nice because Burron kept talking about Death. About Death, and Murder, and Suicide. All with capitals, like I&#39;ve written them. Like each was an entity, a philosophy, a basic truth.\n\nHe kept my glass filled without my ever noticing that he had kept it filled. It didn&#39;t give me that comfortable relaxed feeling, the excellent bourbon didn&#39;t. It made me more and more afraid. It made me afraid, then self-conscious because I, a two-hundred-and-thirty-pound fullback, all muscle and not fat, that could run, and had been on wrestling teams, that I should be afraid of a little pipsqueak in an orange smoking jacket who peered at me and measured me, and sometimes smiled softly at what he found in me.\n\nAnd being self-conscious of my fear, that made me mad. He knew it. He analyzed the whole process, then added gently.\n\n&quot;And now you&#39;re getting mad, aren&#39;t you, Will?&quot; That made me even madder.\n\nEva, wearing a housecoat never designed for the mountains, laughed a little wildly. She was drunk, and she was nasty about it.\n\n&quot;Go on, Will,&quot; she sprawled out, arms thrown back, hands splashing through the spilled ink of her hair. Her lips were set in a kind of snarl. &quot;Go on and bare your soul. You don&#39;t think you were brought up here to enjoy yourself, do you? You damned guinea pig  … vivisection, that&#39;s what it is. Just a lotta damned vivisection … .&quot;\n\nBurron smiled. It was a weary smile as though her part of the experiment was about over. I noticed the blue veins delicately lining his skin.\n\n&quot;We have our little tiffs,&quot; he said. He stood with his back to the fire. &quot;A matter of incompatability of a most thorough kind. She&#39;s primitive. Completely emotional, which is to say, thalamic. While I&#39;m non-emotional, almost completely cortical. Eva reacts emotionally to any kind of stimuli, Will. A simple pleasure-pain behavior. Her world is just a series of barriers against which she must always strive in order to satisfy very basic and simple physical desires.&quot;\n\nI wasn&#39;t impressed. That analysis sounded like everybody.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nSo Different, Yet So Similar\n\nI was looking around the room. It didn&#39;t look like a cabin in the mountain. It looked more like a retreat in Greenwich Village. Mad art on the walls, meaningless and distorted statues made out of pieces of wire and jagged glass. And a series of glass cases along the opposite wall were assorted guns, knives, garroting cords, and other instruments of murder.\n\nHe&#39;d mentioned them. He&#39;d mentioned his library. Books on murder and death. Ranging from journalistic reports of actual cases to poetic passages on the beauty of death. Eva stared into her glass. Burron was watching my roving eyes.\n\n&quot;But you&#39;re so different from Eva, yet so similar, Will,&quot; Burron said. &quot;You&#39;re one of the most interesting examples of atavism, or regression, I&#39;ve ever met. You have a fine mind, but it&#39;s helpless because of your uncontrollable primitive desires.&quot; His pale expressionless eyes looked at me. His statement hit me like a bucket of ice-water.\n\n&quot;You&#39;ve committed murder, Will. At least twice that I know of.&quot;\n\nI started to get up. I was very mad. Eva laughed, hysterically.\n\n&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; I asked. &quot;What the hell&#39;re you talking about? What&#39;s all this blabbing about murder and death? I don&#39;t go for it, Burron. I didn&#39;t come up here to plays games like that. Furthermore, I&#39;m not interested in that high-class tramp there.&quot;\n\nEva threw her glass at me. Burron smiled as the shards of glass tinkled on the floor. &quot;Damn you, both of you,&quot; she yelled.\n\nShe ran up the stairs in a flurry of flashing legs. Burron sat down opposite me. The glass twisted slowly in his white fingers. A dull throbbing was growing in my head. I rubbed my eyes.\n\n&quot;At least twice,&quot; he said again. &quot;But so ugly and sordid and so physical. The man — I don&#39;t remember exactly — you were in a wrestling match. Remember that, Will?&quot;\n\nI felt cold. My throat was dry.\n\n&quot;An accident,&quot; I said. &quot;When I threw him, he landed on his head. His neck broke. It was an accident. In sports like that it — &quot;\n\n&quot; — is murder, Will. Let&#39;s face it.&quot; He leaned toward me. &quot;And knowing you might kill others, by accident, you kept on wrestling. And then there was the unfortunate chap in that football game. You tackled him. He went down. They carried him off the field. Your tackling him was the last thing he ever remembered. An accident, Will. But you kept on playing football.&quot;\n\nThe crackling fire sounded loud. I settled back. The hell with him, I thought. He wanted to see me blow up. I settled back. &quot;Look here, Warren. What&#39;s this all about? What&#39;s the real reason I&#39;m up here?&quot;\n\nBurron smiled in a gentle way. &quot;The real reason, your reason, Will? You&#39;re here because of Eva. You want her. You&#39;ve always resented my taking her away from you.&quot;\n\nI managed a laugh. &quot;You! Your dough, you mean. Why she doesn&#39;t — &quot;\n\nBurron nodded with a weary sigh. &quot;I know. You don&#39;t have to explain what she thinks about me. She married me for my money, and now she has to live up here, isolated, with only me to give her companionship.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s not a nice way to treat a healthy girl,&quot; I said. &quot;And as for resentment — listen, Warren — you have the resentment of the little weak man against a strong man. You can&#39;t deny that. You can cover it up with all kinds of fancy talk. You can be as arty and intellectual as you like — but it all boils down to a damned inferiority complex, Warren. So why can&#39;t we forget it? You&#39;re really jealous of Eva because she wants me, and you know it. That&#39;s the whole thing. You&#39;ve gotten me up here to satisfy some screwy twisted desire. God knows what. So now we face it and forget it. I can still enjoy myself up here. Or even better, drive me back to L. A. tonight, and — &quot;\n\nBurron wasn&#39;t listening. His eyes had a funny shine over them.\n\n&quot;Will — Death is different with me, its fascination I mean, different than it is with you. You love to kill, you enjoy destruction and violence. With me, it&#39;s a different kind of attraction. I worship Death. To end life is the greatest single victory a man can administer to another, and to himself. It&#39;s the method that annoys me.&quot;\n\nHe pointed.\n\n&quot;Those cases. Look at that conglomeration of grisly instruments. Can you imagine anything more horrible and sordid and ugly than to end life with one of those? With blood everywhere, and muscles straining, sweating? I worship Death, too, Will. And I&#39;ve figured out a way to kill. The perfect and the most artistic way. A complete death cycle. Death wrapped up and tied in a perfect gift package to myself. For Death is a woman with dark hair.&quot; Then I got it. The room seemed so very still then. The rain seemed far away. Cold slid along my back. Something was inside my skull with hammers.\n\nHe was going to murder me. Underneath it all, he was just a jealous little guy who was tired of hearing Eva&#39;s griping, and who was tired of hearing her talk about the kind of guys she went for. And he was going to show her, and himself and me. But murder wasn&#39;t all of it.\n\nHe had got me up here to murder me, but I didn&#39;t know how he was going to do it, or when. Except that he would do it like Burron did everything. He was a perfectionist. He would make it beautiful, he said. Clean, complete.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nInevitable, Irresistible\n\nLater I was between cool starched sheets, listening to the rain. Lying, in the dark. I wasn&#39;t sleeping. I was thinking, or trying to. I was scared, and again, I wasn&#39;t scared. It was a challenge, a fight. I liked that.\n\nBut this was a little out of my element. If Burron had been a big man, physically, it would be simple. Burron was right. A big man&#39;s world is simple. It&#39;s physical, and as long as he keeps it on that level, he either wins or loses and that&#39;s that.\n\nBut this was over my head. He was going to get me, but there wouldn&#39;t be any meeting in an arena with swords, guns or fists. Nothing like that. Nothing like that at all.\n\nI couldn&#39;t run out on it now. I couldn&#39;t because I&#39;d been trained too long to fight. So I stayed. But I knew it was wrong. Because of my head.\n\nI kept trying to figure out how Burron was operating. I stayed for one day, then two, then a week, and then two weeks. By then I found out but it was too late. By then I was living in a kind of feverish blinding hell, and I had chopped his head all to pieces with a hand-ax.\n\nEva Burron kept after me. She never let up. Burron deliberately made it inevitable that he would find us together in one situation or another. And Eva wasn&#39;t the kind I could resist. That&#39;s it, simply. I couldn&#39;t. I could hate her guts. I could hate my own. But it didn&#39;t make any difference.\n\nWe were all walking on a bridge. The bridge was made out of spring steel, and it was stretched tighter and tighter. And one night it broke. That&#39;s the way I guess it was.\n\nAfter the third day, I got the hand-ax out of the glass case. It had killed someone before, Burron said. I didn&#39;t think he knew I had it. None of the guns had ammunition. And I couldn&#39;t find any on the place. So I carried the hand-ax under my belt most of the time to protect myself. I didn&#39;t know when or how Burron would strike at me. But I was ready to defend myself.\n\nI&#39;d always believed in defense as a winning method, rather than offense. I&#39;d always been able to turn aggressive tactics into self-defeat. The momentum of a lunging wrestler can be used to put him on his back. The swing of a boxer can carry him right into a knockout punch. I&#39;ve seen an aggressive eleven frustrated and licked time and again by stopping their every play until they lost heart and died. Burron was no wrestler, or boxer or football player. He had his own peculiar approach. Offense, defense? I don&#39;t know. But Burron had his way.\n\nI slept with the ax under my pillow. I carried it under my belt. It was one of those small scouting axes, with a little metal guard that folds out of the handle and sheathes the blade.\n\nHe had to have known I had the ax, but he never let on. Eva noticed it. We were out on the back porch. The moon was shining through the pine branches. She noticed it because she had her arms around me.\n\nA little gasping scream came out against my face as her lips jerked away from mine. She backed away. She blinked and ran her tongue over her lips until they shone wet and red. Her fingers slipped along her cheeks. Her throat moved as she swallowed. &quot;Will  … you&#39;re going to … to kill him!&quot;\n\nI grabbed her wrist. I jerked her around, and she mewed with pain like a kitten.\n\n&quot;Okay,&quot; I said. &quot;You married hjm. You got a lot of money, security. That&#39;s success for a woman and you got it. But that wasn&#39;t what you wanted. You want amusement. You&#39;ve got that now. You should be happy. You want amusement more than success. Don&#39;t pretend you don&#39;t like this, … &quot;\n\nThe screen door slammed. Burron&#39;s voice was low and emotionless.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re quite right, Will. But guilty of over-simplification. Won&#39;t you come in and have a drink?&quot;\n\nEva cried. She turned and ran past Burron and disappeared inside. I walked past Burron slowly, turning as I did so. He held a knife in his hand. One of those knives from one of the glass exhibit cases.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nDeath Is A Woman\n\nI waited until he got past me, then followed him in where I sat down in front of the fire. Eva had run upstairs to cry. Burron stood before the fire, playing with the knife. The fire caught it, threw hard flashes of light over my face. I dropped my hand over the handle of the ax under my shirt. Sweat itched on my face and back.\n\nMy voice had gravel in it. &quot;You want to commit a nice beautiful murder, Warren, or were you only kidding? Anyway, a knife would be so crude.&quot;\n\nBurron looked insulted, but resigned.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re lacking an appreciation for subtlety, but I expected that. Only an artist could appreciate Death as a beautiful thing, for example, a beautiful woman. Sensitive artists like Poe, Keats, Shelley, Byron — it was Death that inspired them. But they were really wooing, you see. Death, to them, was always a lover … .&quot;\n\nHis eyes seemed to grow dark and still. &quot;I love Death too, Will. I want to perform it, like an artist painting, or composing, in a perfect and beautiful way. I want to kill, and I want to be killed. That way, Death would be complete. But the method must be untainted. And it must be perfection. What could be more expressive than these lines by Felix Kowalewski.&quot;\n\nAnd then he quoted poetry to me. Quoted poetry!\n\n&quot;Death is a Woman; Death is soft and sweet;\nDeath is the fairest mistress of our hearts.\nTo our last dreams a magic she imparts\nAnd ends them there. Ah, Death is most discreet!.\nDeath is a Woman; and her hair is dark …\n\nThere was more. I don&#39;t remember the rest.\n\nWhat it seemed to mean was this. That Burron wanted to murder me. Beautifully, and perfectly. But that he also wanted to commit suicide.\n\nI got up. He was still quoting poetry. He was spinning the knife around and around, keeping time to the rhythm of his chanting.\n\n&quot;I never did appreciate poetry very much,&quot; I said. My voice was hoarse. My throat was filled up and I felt a little sick at the stomach. &quot;So you go on and quote poetry and drink that very fine liquor. I&#39;m going up and hit the sack. I&#39;m going to get a good night&#39;s sleep, and I&#39;m going back down to L. A. in the morning. Frankly, Burron, I think you&#39;re crazy as hell. I think you&#39;ve lost your mind. And I don&#39;t want any more of it.&quot;\n\nHis laughter followed me up the rustic stairs. And in that laugh was a crazy, climbing note of something. I didn&#39;t figure out. exactly what until I was opening the cedar-paneled door of my bedroom. And then I knew.\n\nIt was triumph.\n\nEva was in my room waiting for me.\n\nI grabbed her arm and twisted. I shoved her back toward the door.\n\n&quot;Get out,&quot; I said. My voice sounded more savage than I&#39;d intended. &quot;Get out. Maybe I can&#39;t convince you any other way that I don&#39;t like playing with wives, not even lunatics&#39; wives. Maybe I can&#39;t resist too much temptation. But I don&#39;t like it, see. Maybe this will show you how I really feel.&quot;\n\nI slapped her. Her head bobbed like a golden cork on a black pond.\n\nShe squirmed through my fists, into my arms. Her body was hot and it twisted against me. She was heavy against me. I gave way, and my knees caught the edge of the bed. We both fell backward.\n\nAnd Burron opened the bedroom door. His face looked like a splatter of white enamel against the wall. His eyes seemed lifeless. They swam with dark dead lights.\n\n&quot;Just passing,&quot; he said. &quot;I was going to ask Eva if she wanted a — drink, or something. But I see she&#39;s being entertained. Good night.&quot;\n\nEva slammed the door after him. All pretense was gone. Her hair was tumbling, and her eyes were wild. Her face shone white and pinched in the moonlight. Death is a Woman, and her hair is dark.\n\nHer voice broke. &quot;I can&#39;t stand it. I can&#39;t stand it any more.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nThanks For The Cooperation\n\nI pulled her away from the door. I held her close against me, and I kissed her, I smashed my mouth over hers. She sighed, and then I opened the door with one hand and pushed her out into the hall.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going back to L. A. in the morning,&quot; I said. I couldn&#39;t seem to see very well, not because of the dark, but because of that pounding pain in my head, and the blur that kept coming across my eyes. &quot;You can come along for the ride. It&#39;ll be a little cleaner that way.&quot;\n\nI could see only her eyes moving away from me. Her whisper reached me before I closed the door. &quot;All right. Will. That&#39;ll be fine. That&#39;ll be all right with me. I&#39;ll come along for the ride.&quot;\n\nAnd then from still further down the hall, her whisper drifted to me. &quot;Except that I don&#39;t think Warren intends for you to get back … .&quot;\n\nI knew I wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep. I tried to think about something, anything at all to make the hours go faster. And it was dark, and very quiet around the cabin. A night wind rustled through the pine branches, but that was the only sound. But Burron knew I was leaving in the morning. His laugh had been one of victory over me. Whatever he was intending to do, he would do it tonight.\n\nThen things started happening to me. All the time it had been building in me, and all at once it broke loose. I began to sweat. I threw back the cover, and sat in a chair. I started to smoke. I got a bottle out of the bureau and started drinking. Nothing did any good. Aspirins didn&#39;t stop the pressure in my head either. I tried to loosen tense muscles. The whiskey was sickening. The cigarette turned stale in my throat. That pressure in my head tightened.\n\nThat was the state I was in, when Burron suddenly opened the door.\n\nHis little white face was flushed and wet. His eyes were bright. His mouth was partly open. He lunged. He leaped at me, like an eager mouse. I saw only the bright gleam of silver in his upraised hand. I yelled at him. I&#39;d never been afraid before.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re not going to get me, Burron. Not me … .&quot;\n\nI slipped out of the chair as he lunged. I felt my body, heavy and thickly muscled, moving instinctively. But not the way it used to move for me. Maybe he knew I was in bad shape physically, or he&#39;d never have tried to tackle me with a knife. That&#39;s what I thought then. Later I knew the facts. Which aren&#39;t always as they seem, are they?\n\nI wasn&#39;t thinking clearly. I guess he&#39;d planned it this way. My nerves were shot by then. I couldn&#39;t make my mind work right. It was thick and grey. Ordinarily, I would have laughed at a little man like that jumping me. Instead, I was afraid. I had that ax out. I grabbed him with my left hand and brought the ax down. He screamed. Blood ran down over his face. His mouth opened at me.\n\nI didn&#39;t recognize what he said, then. Later, I remembered it..\n\n&quot;Thanks, Will. For the cooperation  … perfect  … neat … .&quot;\n\nI hit him again. He stumbled back and fell in the dark hall. He whispered:\n\n&quot; … and happy he who, dying, knows that bliss  … the far lost music of her  … timeless  … kiss … .&quot;\n\nI finished it there.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nIt Really Wasn&#39;t Murder At All\n\nAll my defense attorney had to offer was an insanity plea. Eva testified that I&#39;d been carrying the ax for days, waiting for my chance. Eva was free, and with money now. And I guess she didn&#39;t want to be stuck with past memories. Wanted to start off fresh and clean.\n\nI&#39;d argued self-defense until my lawyer, Forbes, convinced me that I didn&#39;t have any argument at all. I was a big man, and Burron was a little man. I&#39;d used an ax. And Burron hadn&#39;t had any weapon at all. He&#39;d wiped the fingerprints off the knife he&#39;d been playing with before the murder. And when he came into my room that night, he hadn&#39;t been carrying any weapon at all.\n\nI ran out of the house and bummed a ride into L. A. where the cops soon picked me up. When they found Burron, he didn&#39;t have any weapon in his hand. That silver gleam in his hand I&#39;d thought was the knife … it was one of those expressionistic things made out of wire and pieces of glass. Very shiny and maybe deadly looking in the dark. But something no one could ever be convinced was lethal. It was all Burron&#39;s plan.\n\nHe had it figured out, perfectly. He would murder me that way. He knew Eva, knew she&#39;d testify against me. And I would go to the gas chamber … . He would murder me without laying a hand on me, let the state do it.\n\nSo it really wasn&#39;t murder at all. It was suicide and murder combined.\n\nHe even left a suicide note, addressed to me. But it was no good as evidence. It was poetry, written in the form of a sonnet. I don&#39;t remember it. It doesn&#39;t matter now. All that matters is, that he whispers to me. He whispers and tells me how beautiful it all was. And he keeps thanking me for my cooperation … .\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nYour Perfect Murder Didn&#39;t Come Off\n\nForbes just left. He told me it was okay. No gas chamber. The insanity plea got across. So I&#39;m laughing now, and I&#39;m laughing at you, Burron! Your perfect murder didn&#39;t come off, did it, Burron? Huh? Crawl and squirm in your grave. You didn&#39;t think about the brain concussion did you, Burron? Huh? I had doctors, psychiatrists, on my side. You didn&#39;t think about that did you? And there&#39;s not a damned thing you can do about it now, is there, Burron?\n\nBurron!\n\nBurron! Is there … in the moonlight! …\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  The Nightmare\n  The Grip of The Nightmare\n  The Hour Of Three O&#39;clock\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThese are the facts in Blaisdell&#39;s queer case, taken from a communication addressed to his best friend, Dr. Maynard Hamilton. Dr. Hamilton vouchsafes no explanation, nor do I.\n\nIndeed, there are phenomena in this old world that cannot be explained, as Hamlet pointed out to Horatio in a much-quoted speech.\n\nThe statements given here were contained in a carefully written paper in Blaisdell&#39;s handwriting, that was found in Blaisdell&#39;s desk by Dr. Hamilton several days after the man&#39;s death. From this paper he has pieced together the extraordinary narrative that follows:\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Nightmare\n\nBlaisdell thinks it must have been shortly after midnight that he fell asleep. Horrible nightmares racked him as he tossed upon his bed and one of them was so frightful that he woke up with a scream — or thought he did. At any rate, he suddenly found himself in the centre of his bedchamber, dressing with feverish haste. And here is the queer part of the narrative: for he affirms that, while he was dressing, another man lay in his bed — an exact counterpart of himself. This other ego lay quietly asleep, his head on his arm. Blaisdell studied him carefully and said he felt as a locust must feel when he looks at his outworn shell.\n\nAll the time he was dressing, Blaisdell says he seemed to be impelled to haste by queer promptings that were as insistent as if some person were at his elbow saying &quot;Hurry! Hurry!&quot; He finished his dressing in mad excitement and then hurried out of the room, casting a backward glance over his shoulder at his sleeping counterpart.\n\nOnce outside his apartment house in Gramercy Park, Blaisdell hurried along, his persistent mentor seeming to walk at his elbow. A puzzling feature of this nocturnal prowl was that he felt a sense of familiarity, a feeling that he was on his way to keep an appointment that could not be postponed. The streets were deserted except for an occasional prowler or a patrolman who made the night echo with sharp blows from his club as he struck a metal post occasionally to remind the unlawful that the law was abroad.\n\nOn, on, hurried Blaisdell! By this time he had lost all sense of location, but he was aware that he was in a downtown section of New York — a section that he had never visited during his waking moments. But, although he knew that he had never been in this neighborhood during his conscious moments, he felt that he was on familiar territory.\n\nFinally he paused in front of an old, three-story, brownstone front residence in Washington Square — paused with the air of one who has reached his destination. He walked up the steps and let himself into the house with a pass-key. Nor did it seem strange to him that he had a pass-key for a house that he had never visited during his waking moments. It all seemed ordinary and commonplace.\n\nBlaisdell quietly mounted the stairs until he reached the second floor and there he paused before a closed door, overcome by a suffocating sense of fear and repugnance. He half turned away and then retraced his steps as if fascinated. Something seemed to warn him away from that ominous door, behind which lay a mystery that the everyday Blaisdell, millionaire and bon vivant, did not care to penetrate, but which this nocturnal, prowling Blaisdell seemed to insist upon. Then, without any conscious volition on his part, Blaisdell placed his hand on the knob and the door opened noiselessly.\n\nHe found himself in a large, square living-room, tastefully furnished and lined with built-in bookcases full of handsomely bound volumes. Everywhere he looked, he saw bizarre weapons of defense and men in Chinese and Japanese armor looked threateningly at him from dim corners of the room. It was either the apartment of an art connoisseur or a globe-trotter with a propensity for the unusual.\n\nFrom this room he stepped into a bedchamber and then started back with a little gasp. It was a luxuriously furnished room that appeared to have been transplanted by Aladdin&#39;s wonderful lamp straight from the perfume-scented Orient. Blaisdell advanced further into the room and his feet sank into a wonderful, moss-like carpet. To one side of the room was an old-fashioned four-poster bed, topped by a crimson canopy. In the exact centre of this bed lay a man asleep, with his mouth open.\n\nThere was something strangely familiar about the sleeper, and Blaisdell drew closer and gazed at him steadily. He was an oldish man with a sallow complexion and a wisp of a beard that was slightly tinged with grey. The ghost of a smile lingered upon his lips — a cruel smile that sleep could not make gentle nor mirthful.\n\nAnd as he gazed upon the sleeper, rage grew in Blaisdell&#39;s heart, a rage so furious that it almost suffocated him. Without a moment&#39;s hesitation he seized the sleeper by the throat and began throttling him. The man struggled furiously. His eyes popped open and gazed up into Blaisdell&#39;s with a look of freezing despair. A slight froth gathered upon his purpling lips and he squirmed and writhed like a snake in Blaisdell&#39;s unrelenting grasp. God how he struggled!\n\nBlaisdell&#39;s fingers sank into the throat as if it were satin, and then, suddenly, there were no more struggles. The body fell back inertly as the steel-like fingers relaxed. Blaisdell pulled the bedclothes over the mask of horror and stole quietly from the room. He felt that his errand had been accomplished.\n\nAs he went back over the route that he had just pursued, he felt again that weird sense of unfamiliarity that had at first possessed him, and this feeling of strangeness increased as he neared his own apartment house. He walked in and hurried past the sleeping hall-boy without waking him. Once inside his apartment, he rushed into the bedroom, but his counterpart was gone.\n\nBlaisdell undressed with trembling fingers, but his head had scarcely touched the pillow before he was sound asleep.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Grip of The Nightmare\n\nA shaft of sunlight fell across Blaisdell&#39;s face and he awoke with a shudder.\n\n&quot;Ugh! What a horrible nightmare!&quot; he said aloud. &quot;I feel as if I actually did kill that man!&quot;\n\nThen he yawned and rang for his valet. After a casual breakfast he was glancing through the newspaper when he received the shock that changed him from a careless clubman into a nervous wreck.\n\nQUEER MURDER IN WASHINGTON SQUARE\n\nThat was the headline he read. And then followed an account of the crime. A private policeman, while going his rounds, had found the front door of an old brownstone residence open and had investigated. On the second floor he had found another door ajar and, going in, had found a man lying in a queer bed that was overhung by a red canopy. He was about to steal quietly out, when something in the huddled attitude of the sleeper attracted his attention and he then discovered that the man had been strangled, the marks of fingers being plainly visible upon his throat. The police investigation had established the fact that the man&#39;s name was Stephen R. Rollins, a famous traveller and authority on spiritualism. He had lived for years in the Orient and a monograph of his on occult phenomena had attracted much attention in scientific circles.\n\n&quot;My God!&quot; said Blaisdell, as the paper fell from his trembling hands. &quot;My God! Did I go to that man&#39;s apartment while I was in the grip of that nightmare and murder him? Did I?&quot;\n\nThese questions nearly drove him frantic. What should he do ? What course of action was there for him to pursue? If he went to the police and told them that he, Herman Blaisdell, descendant of a fine old New York family, had gone forth into the night and killed a man he had never seen before — in his sleep — what would they think of him? They would probably shrug their shoulders and advise him to consult an alienist.\n\nAnd yet this man, this Stephen R. Rollins, was dead, and his description and that of his apartment coincided in every detail with the place that Blaisdell had visited in his dream. But was it a dream ? And who was the other man that lay in his bed as he went out? These questions revolved in his mind like a vicious circle, almost driving him insane.\n\nBlaisdell aged after that. He looked ten years older and his friends were alarmed about him. Dr. Hamilton advised a change of environment and rigorous physical exercise, otherwise he would not be responsible for the consequences. The man jumped at every sound and had a mortal terror of the night. He would put off going to bed until the latest possible moment and then always slept with a light in his room. Sometimes his valet would come quavering to his bedside in the night, frightened out of his wits by frightful screams from Blaisdell.\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t do it! I didn&#39;t do it! I couldn&#39;t have done it!&quot; he would scream, his eyes staring! &quot;The thing is impossible! The thing is impossible!&quot;\n\nWhen these spells were upon him he would shake and it would finally be necessary for his valet to give him a sleeping powder. These things became noised abroad and he resigned from his clubs, went nowhere and declined all invitations. He was a broken man!\n\n&quot;A hopeless hypochondriac! Just a morbid victim of nerves — or drink,&quot; said his friends — and dropped him.\n\nThings went on like this for months, and then one day Blaisdell read another item in a newspaper that dumfounded him. It detailed the arrest of a man named Franklin Sears, who was charged with the murder of Stephen R. Rollins.\n\n&quot;But he couldn&#39;t have murdered him! I murdered him — murdered him in my sleep,&quot; mumbled Blaisdell.\n\nThat afternoon one of the sensational newspapers published a picture of Franklin Sears — and Blaisdell cried aloud in new fright.\n\nHis valet found him with the newspaper in his hand, mouthing and trembling — his nerves vibrating like a taut piano wire.\n\nFor the face that stared back at Blaisdell from the front page was his own face. Yet Franklin Sears&#39; name was under it!\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Hour Of Three O&#39;clock\n\nLater Sears confessed to the murder. He told the police that he and Rollins had been chums and college mates. Rollins had fallen madly in love with Sears&#39; beautiful sister and had persuaded her to go away with him under promise of marriage. They had gone to South America, where Rollins had amassed a fortune, and had then visited the Orient. She begged Rollins to make her his wife but he refused and finally deserted her.\n\nA serious illness followed and she sent for her brother, who promised her that he would not rest until her betrayer had been brought to book. She died, assured that he would avenge her. And he had kept his word, although he had to trail Rollins all over the world before he finally ran him down in Washington Square.\n\nBlaisdell followed the developments in the Sears case with absorbed attention. He read the newspapers feverishly and finally decided that he could stand the suspense no longer. He determined to go to the Tombs, confront his counterpart and tell him the story of the nightmare. Surely there was an explanation of it all. There must be an explanation. He had decided to visit Sears the next day, when the last queer thing happened in the tragic series of happenings.\n\nOn the morning of Blaisdell&#39;s intended visit, Dr. Hamilton read in his morning paper that Franklin Sears, the murderer of Stephen R. Rollins, had committed suicide in the Tombs by hanging himself to one of the bars by his suspenders.\n\nThe paper commented upon the somewhat unusual fact that the prisoner&#39;s watch was found on his body and that it had stopped at three o&#39;clock. It was just a few minutes past three when the body was discovered — still warm.\n\nDr. Hamilton had scarcely finished reading this account when his telephone bell rang. The excited voice of Blaisdell&#39;s valet asked him to come at once to his master&#39;s apartment, as something terrible had happened.\n\nHe responded at once, and when he was ushered into Blaisdell&#39;s bedroom by the white-faced valet, he saw at once that he could do nothing further for his friend. Blaisdell was dead, and it was very evident from the stiffness of his body that he had been dead for many hours.\n\n&quot;It ain&#39;t his bein&#39; dead that&#39;s so terrible,&quot; said the trembling valet. &quot;It&#39;s — it&#39;s — well, look there!&quot;\n\nHe pointed to the throat of the dead man. There was the distinct mark of a rope upon it and this mark extended clear around his neck.\n\n&quot;He — he couldn&#39;t have hung himself,&quot; quavered the valet, &quot;because I was the first person who saw him — and there ain&#39;t any rope!&quot;\n\nSome unaccountable impulse made Dr. Hamilton pick up Blaisdell&#39;s watch from the dresser.\n\nIt had stopped running, the hands recording the hour of three o&#39;clock.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Miss Baxter, who was hefty and healthy despite her morbid ideas, rather liked him, and called him Snoopy.\n\nThey were very neighbourly. At least, Miss Baxter was. Sir Reginald, small, frail and timid, seemed to stand in awe of her.\n\nWhen the pair called on Dixon Hawke at Dover Street, it was with difficulty that the criminologist repressed a smile.\n\nThe story, which Miss Baxter told in the maximum number of words, was bewildering in the extreme.\n\n&quot;Do I understand you to say,&quot; demanded the astonished detective, &quot;that your home is — simply crawling with ghosts?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Miss Baxter impatiently, &quot;but that isn&#39;t what we&#39;ve called about. I don&#39;t mind ghosts. I&#39;m used to them. I&#39;ve seen dozens, scores, hundreds. In fact, I&#39;m an authority on the supernatural.&quot;\n\nMembers of the Psychical Research Society had, it appeared, visited her home to investigate her claim that it was haunted by a poltergeist.\n\n&quot;That isn&#39;t what we&#39;ve called about at all,&quot; said Miss Baxter. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t consult you about ghosts. I know far more about them than you do. What we want you to do is to find out if what Sir Reginald says is true.&quot;\n\n&quot;And what is that?&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, you see, Sir Reginald came over to my place recently, and during his visit he heard the rattling and knocking and scraping of the poltergeist, and he doesn&#39;t believe it is a poltergeist.&quot;\n\n&quot;You see,&quot; put in Sir Reginald, &quot;I&#39;m afraid my view is that noises of that sort can only be made by a human agency, and, that being so, it means only one thing — namely, that something unauthorised, and possibly criminal, is going on. The noises sometimes seem to come from the cellar, which is cut out of the living rock, and sometimes from just outside the house, by the sea wall. I don&#39;t trust Miss Baxter&#39;s secretary. Anyway, he looks like a jailbird.&quot;\n\nMiss Baxter smiled radiantly. &quot;Sir Reginald&#39;s a lawyer,&quot; she said, &quot;and awfully cautious about making statements. You note he says that Gill looks like a jailbird. Looks, mark you! And, all the time, he knows perfectly well that Gill is a jailbird. I got him from the Discharged Prisoners&#39; Aid Society.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh,&quot; exclaimed Hawke dryly, &quot;I see. So you have come to me with an eye to the possibility that Sir Reginald may, after all, be right.&quot;\n\n&quot;Gill is an ex-convict, and I think he really means to live down his past life. But I&#39;m not a fool, and it&#39;s possible he may be up to something.&quot;\n\n&quot;And what do you wish me to do?&quot;\n\n&quot;Come and be my guest at Searock House for a week, and watch Gill. Also my butler, Warren. I don&#39;t know whether he&#39;s an ex-convict or not, but he looks thoroughly dishonest. I engaged him out of curiosity, and I only keep him on because Sir Reginald wants me to sack him.&quot;\n\n&quot;H&#39;m. No doubt you find that a sufficient reason. Wouldn&#39;t it clear the air, though, and simplify matters altogether, if you were to discharge both the secretary and the butler?&quot;\n\n&quot;And turn Gill into a criminal again? When I might be reforming him? Oh, I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d make such a suggestion, Mr. Hawke!&quot;\n\nHawke assumed the solemn expression that Miss Baxter seemed to expect of him.\n\n&quot;Now tell me, apart from servants, is there anyone else at Searock House?&quot;\n\n&quot;My nephew, Sidney Forsythe, and his wife. They&#39;ve been staying with me for the past six months — since they returned from Canada. I hadn&#39;t seen Sidney since he was a little boy. His parents died out there, but he preferred to stay on, for he had employment. I sent him cheques from time to time, to help him along, and he sent me letters regularly. Such a nice boy — &quot;\n\nShe broke off and sighed.\n\n&quot;But how marriage alters some people,&quot; she added.\n\n&quot;He has altered — for the worse!&quot;\n\n&quot;He&#39;s somehow taciturn and morose. And since he&#39;s been staying with me, his financial requirements have grown steadily heavier. I&#39;m afraid that Ena, his wife, has led him into extravagant ways.&quot;\n\nThe woman was obviously preparing to give a long recital of family history, but Hawke adroitly headed her off, and brought the interview to a close, with the promise that he and his young assistant, Tommy Burke, would be visiting Searock House on the morrow.\n\nAbout ten minutes after their departure the bell rang, and Sir Reginald was presently re-admitted to the study, this time unaccompanied.\n\nHe seated himself, and faced Hawke across the latter&#39;s massive desk. Without Miss Baxter s overpowering presence, the detective was able to take better stock of him.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Queer Household\n\nA characteristic which now struck Hawke was the steadiness of Sir Reginald&#39;s clear blue eyes.\n\nHawke suddenly realised the significance of this physical attribute.\n\n&quot;Of course,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;you are Wilmer, the Bisley man — the crack shot! I&#39;ve seen your picture in the papers many times.&quot;\n\nThe other nodded.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right, Mr. Hawke. I&#39;m something of a pot-hunter.&quot;\n\n&quot;A successful one, at any rate. What&#39;s on your mind now?&quot;\n\n&quot;That nephew of hers. It&#39;s no business of mine, but I don&#39;t like seeing her imposed upon. And, in my opinion, Mr. Hawke, that nephew is imposing on her. I don&#39;t care for the looks of him — great, big, hefty young loafer. If there&#39;s dirty work going on there, I shouldn&#39;t be surprised if he&#39;s at the bottom of it. I — er — thought I&#39;d drop the hint. Couldn&#39;t very well say it in Miss Baxter&#39;s presence.\n\n&quot;You&#39;ll find it a queer household, Mr. Hawke, what with her infernal astrology and crystal-gazing. She has one room cluttered up with hideous skulls, death masks, and astrological symbols. Lot of rubbish.&quot;\n\n&quot;What Miss Baxter needs,&quot; said Hawke lightly, &quot;is a husband and a family.&quot;\n\nHe was amused at the look of alarm which appeared on Sir Reginald&#39;s face.\n\n&quot;I say!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;You don&#39;t think the woman has designs on me, do you? Lots of people do. Heaven forbid!&quot;\n\n&quot;Hasn&#39;t she — er — foretold her own destiny by means of the symbols and things!&quot;\n\n&quot;Great Scott, yea! And mine, and everybody else&#39;s in the neighbourhood. Everybody has a mystic number, which, so far as I can make out, means exactly nothing. She has been good enough to tell me that she will marry. There&#39;s a soul-mate to come along — I wish he&#39;d hurry up — and he will arrive by the sign of the Eye of the Needle, whatever that is, and his mystic number&#39;s six hundred.&quot;\n\n&quot;I hope it all turns out satisfactorily to you, Sir Reginald,&quot; said Hawke with a smile. &quot;So far as I am concerned, I am regarding the little commission as being a break from more serious work, but I promise you I&#39;ll do my best to expose any under-handed activities which may be going on.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nMiss Baxter&#39;s Ghosts\n\nIt was exhilarating to climb the steps to the top of the six-foot-thick sea wall surrounding Searock House, but not advisable for persons with no head for heights, nor for anyone on a really gusty day, for the outer surface of the wall was flush with the cliff face, and there was a drop of close on two hundred feet from the top of the wall to the rock-strewn beach below.\n\nHawke and Tommy Burke both enjoyed the experience, and breathed their fill of sea air.\n\nThe bracing outdoor atmosphere was a striking change from that prevailing within the house.\n\nShortly after their arrival, Miss Baxter introduced the visitors to her &quot;wizard&#39;s den,&quot; as she called it.\n\nIt was the sort of apartment that Sir Reginald had described.\n\nThe walls were plastered with charts and hieroglyphics. The lighting was provided by electric globes, which shone through the eye sockets of skulls and the eyes of stuffed owls, bracketed about the walls.\n\nThere was a bookcase in one corner, full of massive volumes, mostly dealing with astrology and folklore.\n\nIt appeared that the &quot;den&quot; was principally a place for the entertainment of members of the local women&#39;s institute, of which Miss Baxter was president.\n\nMiss Baxter was an ardent church-woman, and the detective was intrigued by the ingenious way in which she reconciled orthodox religion with her frivolous dabblings in black magic.\n\nHe became convinced that her apparent faith in her ridiculous symbols and omens was largely an extravagant pose.\n\nNevertheless, that did not explain certain other startling things which presently began to occupy his attention.\n\nConversation had lapsed, Miss Baxter being immersed in a passage in one of her books, which had suddenly caught her eye, and Hawke and Tommy were sitting staring abstractedly about them, when suddenly the door flew open, with unnatural violence.\n\nThe startled guests stared at the open doorway, but no one entered. The passage beyond the doorway was gloomy, so that it was impossible to perceive who or what had been responsible for thrusting open the door.\n\nAutomatically, they turned questioning faces towards their hostess, who was eyeing them quizzically.\n\n&quot;That,&quot; she said, in unruffled tones, &quot;is the poltergeist. He appears to be in one of his more violent moods today. He generally smashes things up when he&#39;s like that. It&#39;s quite alarming. Things suddenly smash to pieces in front of your eyes, apparently without cause.&quot;\n\nShe had hardly spoken the words when there was a crashing of glass at the far end of the room, and the thoroughly bewildered visitors turned to see the shattering of a glass pane in a cabinet which stood against the wall, facing the doorway.\n\nHawke rose and walked towards the cabinet.\n\n&quot;Aren&#39;t you afraid,&quot; demanded Miss Baxter, &quot;that the poltergeist might work some violence on your person. I never move about the room when he&#39;s here. It seems like asking for trouble.&quot;\n\nWithout paying the slightest heed, the detective proceeded to examine the damaged cabinet, pulling open the doors, gingerly sorting over the fragments of glass, and inspecting the woodwork at the back.\n\nThis done, he turned and spoke to Tommy.\n\n&quot;Run up and get my instrument-case,&quot; he said. &quot;And take care not to touch that door-handle.&quot;\n\n&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; asked Miss Baxter.\n\n&quot;Make a simple test,&quot; was the answer. &quot;You see, you were the last person to touch the door-handle before it was thrust open in that mysterious way. By treating it with a special powder which I carry in my research-case your fingerprints should be clearly revealed. What I shall be interested to see is whether anyone else&#39;s fingerprints have since been superimposed on them.&quot;\n\n&quot;What is the next step in tracking down a ghost — after you&#39;ve got its fingerprints?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;m afraid I take the same view as Sir Reginald — that these things are occasioned by a human agency.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sir Reginald&#39;s a well-meaning ninny!&quot;\n\n&quot;Miss Baxter,&quot; said Hawke after a thoughtful pause, &quot;I don&#39;t want you to take offence at this question, but in fairness to both of us I feel impelled to put it. You are not playing any practical joke, are you? That is to say, you are not deliberately party to a hoax of any sort?&quot;\n\nMiss Baxter stared at him, and, just when he was expecting an outburst, she replied calmly enough:\n\n&quot;It&#39;s a reasonable question. I&#39;m one of a large and growing band of people who believe in psychic phenomena, simply from the evidence of their senses. I give you my word that I am not a party to any hoax.&quot;\n\n&quot;Thanks, Miss Baxter. I believe you said, when you called on me at Dover Street, that you were quite accustomed to seeing ghosts about the place. Do you really claim to have seen ghosts?&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course.&quot;\n\nPulling open a drawer of her desk, she produced a photographic print and passed it across.\n\nIt was a blurred picture of a lady standing by a window. Her head was turned away from the camera, and she was draped in a loose white gown, suspended from her shoulders and reaching to the floor.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s a photograph of one. What more do you want? I took it by moonlight on the landing outside my bedroom, using a camera with a huge lens which I had bought specially.&quot;\n\n&quot;You mean you expected to see this — er — ghost?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve seen it dozens of times. It walks down the stairs from the top of the house, and disappears somewhere below. I thought if I could photograph it, people would believe me, but, bless you, people won&#39;t believe anything! I took it to newspaper offices, and they asked how I could prove that it was not a faked picture.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Hidden Passage\n\nJust then Tommy returned with the research-case, and for the next half-hour the two were busy powdering and photographing the outside doorknob.\n\n&quot;And now,&quot; said Miss Baxter when the operation had been completed, &quot;do you want to take the servants&#39; finger-prints?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll take yours now, Miss Baxter. I think I would prefer not to say anything about this to anyone else. I can collect fingerprints, by various means, surreptitiously.&quot;\n\nAt dinner Hawke and Tommy met the Forsythes. Nephew Sidney was tall and powerfully built, and he seemed to be nursing a secret sorrow. Throughout the meal he scarcely spoke, the conversation being almost monopolised by Mrs. Forsythe.\n\nAfter coffee Hawke took the opportunity of having a word with Gill in the library.\n\nAt first the private secretary&#39;s attitude was hostile, but Hawke had a way with him, and they were presently conversing quite amiably.\n\nHawke questioned him about the Forsythes, and learned that they came from Toronto.\n\nLater he talked with Sidney Forsythe, who gave his opinion tersely.\n\n&quot;My aunt&#39;s mad,&quot; he declared — a remark which certainly seemed to have behind it all the force of robust common-sense.\n\nBy showing copies of Miss Baxter&#39;s photograph of the white lady, Hawke secured the finger-prints of most of the company, and he and Tommy retired to Miss Baxter&#39;s photographic darkroom, where they remained until a late hour.\n\nWhen they returned to the library everyone had gone to bed, and the place was oppressively silent, the faint, far-off rumbling of the sea only serving to enhance the sense of isolation.\n\nTommy glanced nervously about him.\n\n&quot;By Jove, guv&#39;nor! I can&#39;t say I&#39;d care to be in this shack on my own.&quot;\n\nHis employer laughed.\n\n&quot;Come, let&#39;s go down to the cellar, and see what there is to be seen,&quot; he said.\n\nThey were in the cellar a considerable time, for they discovered a low, narrow passage leading from one end of it to the cliff-face.\n\nThe entrance was concealed by boxes, and it was quite possible that Miss Baxter was unaware of its presence, for that part of the cellar was almost shut off from the rest by a pile of bricks, evidently part of an uncompleted wall.\n\n&quot;There may have been a path leading right down to the beach at one time,&quot; remarked Hawke. &quot;There are lots of places like it about the coast. The lower half of the old smuggler&#39;s path gets demolished through a landslide. The point to bear in mind is that anyone who came down here to make noises with the object of scaring Miss Baxter could easily find concealment in the event of a search being made.&quot;\n\n&quot;But why should anyone want to scare Miss Baxter? Besides, it doesn&#39;t scare her. She actually seems to like the noises.&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know. We may find that out presently. Now to bed.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nOn the Brink of Death\n\nIt was a small point, but one of vital significance to the man from Dover Street.\n\nMiss Baxter was showing him a file of letters the following afternoon — typewritten epistles which her nephew had written her from Canada. They dated back for several years, and, after the manner of aunts of her type, Miss Baxter had preserved them all.\n\nHawke remembered seeing Forsythe typing a letter on a portable machine in the library that morning. He had been typing awkwardly, jabbing at the keys with his two middle fingers.\n\nThe detective now bent his attention to the letters, displaying particular interest in those of recent date.\n\nSidney Forsythe had spent a lot of time typing letters that morning, and had since been walking about wearing a worried frown. Several times Hawke caught him talking to Mrs. Forsythe in urgent, heated undertones.\n\n&quot;Tommy,&quot; he said later, &quot;I want to get a little collaboration from Gray. Telephone Scotland Yard, will you? Not from here. Go over to Wilmer&#39;s place, and explain all about it to him. He&#39;ll let you use his phone. Now, I&#39;ll tell you what I want done.&quot;\n\nTommy listened carefully to his employer&#39;s instructions, and an hour later had carried them out.\n\nSir Reginald called over later in the evening and his presence saved the situation socially, for the Forsythes seemed to have a squabble of their own on, and were at no pains to conceal their irritability.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ve got to take it in turns to keep an eye on Miss Baxter&#39;s room tonight,&quot; said Hawke to his assistant as bedtime drew near. &quot;There is, as Wilmer suspected some sort of intrigue going on. Something tells me it&#39;s pretty serious, and I have a feeling that Miss Baxter might be in some danger.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, all I hope,&quot; said Tommy fervently, &quot;is that if the white lady appears, she does it in your watch.&quot;\n\nHawke chuckled.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll see any white lady, but, if you do, just conceal yourself and watch where she goes.&quot;\n\nThe vigil, however, proved uneventful. The ghost did not walk, and even the poltergeist seemed to have tired of his pranks.\n\nMiss Baxter was an early riser, and it was her practice to take a stroll round the sea wall before breakfast.\n\nSoon after seven there was a telephone call for Hawke from Sir Reginald, who had had a call from Scotland Yard.\n\nHawke sent Tommy over to Westleigh, having decided to continue his unobtrusive guardianship of Miss Baxter.\n\nTommy had been gone about a quarter of an hour, and Miss Baxter had reached a section of the sea wall not overlooked from the house, when there were sudden, swift developments.\n\nSidney Forsythe appeared from round a corner of the building, and, after a cautious glance round, climbed to the top of the wall where Miss Baxter was strolling, and approached her stealthily from behind.\n\nHawke came out from his place of concealment, and was after him with the agility of a cat.\n\nForsythe was almost in the act of giving his aunt the shove which would have sent her to her death when the detective pounced on him.\n\nMiss Baxter turned with a startled cry, and, when she saw what was happening, she did what was for her an extraordinarily feminine thing. She fainted.\n\nIt was fortunate that the wall was so broad, or she might have toppled over.\n\nHawke had taken on a terrible task. Forsythe was slightly more than his match in strength, though not quite as nimble. But he struggled with a ferocity born of panic, and the odds were that both would go hurtling to the beach below.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA &quot;Long Shot&quot; Comes Off\n\nIt was the keen-eyed Wilmer who first sighted the two tiny figures locked in their grim struggle, and he had snatched up a telescope to survey them just as Tommy arrived.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s Hawke and Forsythe,&quot; he gasped. &quot;They&#39;ll both go over.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good heavens, sir!&quot; cried Tommy. &quot;What can we do?&quot;\n\n&quot;We can&#39;t reach them in time. Telephone to Gill or the butler. Quick!&quot; Tommy rushed into the house, but was out again in a moment.\n\n&quot;Line&#39;s engaged,&quot; he said desperately, &quot;and I can&#39;t make the fool at the exchange cut in.&quot;\n\nSir Reginald put down his telescope and rushed indoors, returning in a few seconds with a rifle fitted with telescopic sights.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s a chance in a thousand,&quot; he said. &quot;I might be able to pick off Forsythe without hitting Hawke.&quot;\n\nHe clicked the bolt, and adjusted the trajectory scale.\n\n&quot;I should put the range,&quot; he said thoughtfully, &quot;at about a couple of hundred yards short of the half-mile.&quot; A moment later he was lying full length on the ground, resting on his elbows, squinting down the sights.\n\nThe breathless Tommy saw the great marksman, Sir Reginald Wilmer, in action.\n\nHawke, struggling on the sea wall, heard Forsythe gasp and felt him go suddenly limp a second or so before he heard the report, and by that time he had taken advantage of his opportunity, and the pair rolled down the steps on to the inland side of the wall.\n\nForsythe lay on the ground, breathing stertorously, blood oozing up from behind his collar. He was unconscious.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nFate — and Sir Reginald!\n\nTommy and Sir Reginald drove over to Seabrook House, the former having been in touch with Scotland Yard over the phone.\n\nThe local police had already arrived with a doctor and an ambulance.\n\n&quot;A fractured shoulder-blade,&quot; reported the doctor. &quot;He&#39;ll be all right.&quot;\n\n&quot;Not be very all right,&quot; murmured Hawke, after Mr. and Mrs. Forsythe had been taken away.\n\n&quot;Tell me what it&#39;s all about,&quot; demanded Miss Baxter, who had now fully regained her normal composure.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s not your nephew, Miss Baxter. An official colleague of mine at Scotland Yard has been in touch with the Toronto police, who recognised his description as that of a criminal named Ronald Hawker, supposed to have been killed in a car crash. I&#39;m afraid you will find, Miss Baxter, that it was your nephew who was killed. This man had gained his confidence and learned all about his wealthy aunt in England. He probably engineered the crash.\n\n&quot;You see, he learned everything he possibly could about your family history and them practised this imposture, relying on the fact that you had not seen your nephew since childhood. Have you — er — made a will in his favour?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot;\n\nHawke nodded.\n\n&quot;I fancy that creditors have been pressing him of late. He&#39;s been typing letters to them, to stave them off. It is not difficult to visualise his plan. He and his wife played ghosts, knowing your susceptibilities in that direction. You talked about these ghosts, and earned yourself a reputation for being — if you don&#39;t mind my saying so — eccentric. One day you were to be found dashed to death on those rocks, and there would not be any very close inquiry — you being a known eccentric.&quot;\n\n&quot;And the poltergeist?&quot;\n\nFrom his hip-pocket Hawke produced a small piece of metal.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;\n\n&quot;An air-pistol bullet. I found it lodged in the wood at the back of that cabinet, which, if you remember, was facing the doorway. Forsythe had fired at it from the passage, after shoving the door open and darting back to cover. The fingerprints on the door-handle will supply evidence to prove that, if it is needed. He had worked a similar stunt several times, and he worked it on this occasion, not knowing of our presence. He thought you were alone.&quot;\n\n&quot;And I suppose the white lady was Mrs. Forsythe?&quot;\n\n&quot;Undoubtedly.&quot;\n\nHawke turned to Wilmer.\n\n&quot;By the way,&quot; he said, &quot;I must congratulate you on that absolutely miraculous shot.&quot;\n\nSir Reginald displayed his gratification.\n\n&quot;I used a Swift Express Special .22, the latest high-velocity weapon,&quot; he said. &quot;Telescopic sights, you know. But even so, it was a mighty tricky task. It was like shooting through the eye of a needle, and the range was six hundred yards — &quot;\n\nSomething oddly familiar in the words he had just uttered seemed to dawn on Sir Reginald and his jaw dropped.\n\n&quot;Snoopy!&quot;\n\nMiss Baxter was goggling at him.\n\n&quot;The eye of a needle! Six hundred!&quot;\n\nHawke and Tommy were present at the wedding.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Three of us heard him tell\nit — Willoughby, the eminent English clergyman, who is now filling a\nnumber of lecture engagements in this country, Mosby, the attorney, and\nmyself—and we are all firmly convinced that he spoke the truth. I write\nit just as he gave it to us.\n\nWe were spending a few days in early spring at Mosby’s country place.\n\nPossibly the weather had something to do with the way the story\nimpressed us. It was a dark, stormy night, with drizzling grists of rain\nand a shrieking, howling wind that shook the window panes and whistled\nand moaned through the leafless trees—one of those nights that make the\nshivers run up and down your backbone in pleasurable anticipation of the\nscare that never comes—a night created especially for tales of yawning\ngraves and spiritual manifestations.\n\nSeated in front of the huge, open fireplace in Mosby’s big living room—a\nroom so large that there were shadows in every corner—it was only\nnatural that the talk should drift onto haunted houses, life after death\nand the supernatural in all its varying phases.\n\nMosby, who is something of an amateur psychologist, had been reading Sir\nOliver Lodge, Sir Arthur Doyle and other writers on spiritual lines and\nwas filled with enthusiasm and a working idea of Ouija boards, spirit\nrappings and table tipping. On the other hand, Willoughby, like most\nclergyman, was an open scoffer. The argument continued for an hour or\ntwo without result.\n\nFinally Colby, who had been listening and saying nothing, was appealed\nto.\n\n“There is no question in my mind,” he answered, weighing his words\ncarefully, as he always does when he speaks seriously, “that our\ndeparted friends watch over us and, given half a chance, will offer us a\nhelping hand.”\n\n“Bosh!” shouted the clergyman. “Give us proofs, man! Don’t deal in\ngeneralities. Offer us something tangible!”\n\nColby hesitated before answering. “What I am about to tell you,” he\nsaid, finally, “is a true story. I have never repeated it to anyone\nbefore, because I do not care to have people doubt my word—and the\naverage man is prone to scoff at what he cannot understand. To me, there\nis only one explanation—that of spirit intervention. Perhaps you, as a\nclergyman, with a supposedly better knowledge of the hereafter than is\ngiven us ordinary mortals, can offer a solution to the puzzle.”\n\nAnd this is the story that Martin Colby told:\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nMartin Colby’s Story\n\n“I was suffering from brain fag. The novel on which I was at work—my\nlatest, by the way—threatened to be a dismal failure, as a result. For\nweeks I had not touched the typewriter, lacking ideas to put on paper.\nMy publishers were clamoring for the manuscript. The book had been\nannounced through the press and the advance royalties were already\nbanked to my credit. I owed it to them as well as myself, to bring my\nwork to a close.\n\n“But I was dissatisfied. The plot, itself, was the best thing that I had\never done. But the story lacked that indescribable something that marks\nthe really finished product from the machine-made drivel. It sounded\nforced and strained. In other words, it had no punch. And my heroine!\nHeavens, what a woman! She had as much life as a wilted rag doll.\n\n“Anyone who is familiar with my work knows that I write of the wilds,\nthe prairies, the forests, the icy barrens. But this story was to be a\ndeparture. It was to be a tale of human emotions—a drama seething with\npassion and depicting the under side of life among the dwellers of the\ngreat city. But my heroine was to be a woman of the Northland,\ntransplanted from her native snows and ice, hedged in on all sides by\nwickedness, yet keeping herself clean and pure in spite of her\nsurroundings.\n\n“I wanted to make her a girl of unusual strength of character, one who\ndominated every page of the book and held the reader’s undivided love,\nrather than the insipid, white-livered anaemic who wandered through the\nstory like an automaton. But, in spite of everything, I was unable to\nconcentrate on her—to inject any life into her. Every writer has such\nexperiences at times. I have had them before and I expect to have them\nagain.\n\n“And then, one afternoon, like a bolt of lightning out of a clear sky,\ncame a working streak. I tackled the story with renewed vim and\nenthusiasm. For hours I wrote and rewrote, hacked and edited. From\nsomewhere in the hidden recesses of my brain evolved a new heroine—Edith\nMorley—a sweet-faced, golden haired, full-breasted, red-blooded woman—a\nlovable girl and a true daughter of the Vikings I love so well.\n\n“Far into the night I worked. Under my flying thoughts, Edith Morley\ngrew, developing with every change, blossoming forth into radiant\nwomanhood. I tell you, I was obsessed with her. And, gentlemen, without\negotism, I say frankly that she became so real to me that she walks\nthrough the pages of my book a living, pulsating character instead of a\ncreature of my imagination. But as for that, you can judge for\nyourselves when the story comes out next month.\n\n“I forgot dinner, everything, in the enthusiasm of my work. I have no\nidea how long I worked. It was far into the night and, sometime during\nthe evening, I had automatically switched on the lights. But, finally,\nflesh and blood could stand it no longer. I fell across the table, my\nhead pillowed in my arms. Whether I fainted or whether it was the sleep\nfollowing exhaustion, I do not pretend to say.\n\n“Was I really asleep? I do not know. I’ll swear that I could hear the\nclock ticking in the adjoining room and the thousand-and-one other odd,\nmysterious, little sounds that come in the middle of the night. Yet I\nmust have been asleep. There is no other explanation.”\n\n“Suddenly, I heard a scream—a piercing, terror-stricken shriek — coming\nout of the darkness of the night.\n\n“Edith Morley stood before me!\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEnjoying The Strange Story of Martin Colby?\n\t\tClick to get another mind-bending SUPERNATURAL thriller &amp;hellip;\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTHE MAN WHO WOULD NOT DIEby Harold Ward(52 min read)Black Mask | Sept. 1920 | Vol. 1, No. 6\n\t\n\t\t\t&quot;What is death, my dear inspectors?

She was panting\ndesperately. Her arms were outstretched towards me, her fingers working\nconvulsively. Her dress was torn so that a glimpse of the round, white\nshoulder showed. In her eyes was a look of despair, of helpless appeal.\nHer long, golden hair hung about her waist in tangled disarray. I knew\nthat she was asking me for help. I attempted to arouse myself from the\nhorrible, paralyzing constriction that held me to my chair. But I was\nhelpless, bound down by invisible bands.\n\n“And then, into the focus leaped a man—a human beast—a thick-lipped,\ncoarse-featured creature with snapping black eyes that glowered and\nblazed between red, swollen lids, and a bluish-dark growth of whisker\nthat only served to emphasize the brutal viciousness of his undershot\nlower jaw. I tell you, he was a creature straight from the Inferno.\n\n“At sight of the girl, the bestial lips parted, showing a glimpse of\ndecaying, tobacco-stained teeth. He raised one black, hairy hand and\nbeckoned. The girl drew back a trifle further, the look of desperation\nkindled anew in her eyes, one white, slender hand pressed against her\npalpitating breast.\n\n“As Heaven is my witness, I saw that tragedy unfold itself in front of\nmy eyes with all the vividness of a motion picture thrown upon the\nscreen. I struggled with every bit of strength at my command to tear\nmyself loose from the invisible hands that glued me to my chair. But in\nvain. I watched the beast slowly drawing himself forward like a snake\nabout to strike. I could not move. Nearer and nearer he came, passing so\nclose to me that I could smell his whiskey-and-tobacco-laden breath,\nmoving with cat-like stealth. And, as he approached her, she drew\nfarther and farther away until she found her back against the wall. Her\nwild, blue eyes looked into mine, tense with fear, desperate—and I was\nhelpless.\n\n“God! The sweat poured from every pore in my body. Then, suddenly, he\nlaunched himself at her. What a fight she put up to keep him from her,\nstriking, clawing, biting. She was like a wounded tigress at bay. Her\nwaist was torn into shreds. On the white flesh of her arms, the bruises\nstood out with startling vividness.\n\n“With an almost superhuman effort, she twisted herself from his grasp\nand leaped away. Once more he drove her into a corner. Again that look\nof piteous appeal to me. Then, before he could seize her again, her\nconvulsive fingers reached into the bosom of her dress and returned with\na tiny bottle on which the death’s head showed a brilliant scarlet under\nthe electric lamp.\n\n“Before she could convey it to her mouth, the beast was upon her, his\ntalons tightened about her wrist. She battled now with the energy of\ndespair. Backward he bent her arm until I listened for the snap that\ntells of the agony of broken bones. But again, through some strange\ntwist of fate, she tore herself from his grasp. Her freedom was but for\nan instant. Yet it was long enough for her to carry the tiny vial to her\nlips.\n\n“Then she crumpled up in a little heap on the floor. And, gentlemen, I\nwill swear that there was a smile of happiness on her face.\n\n“I awoke with a start. For a second I gazed about me, wide-eyed, trying\nto collect myself even in the midst of my own apartments. Then, with\nevery nerve tingling in response to some psychic force, I rushed out of\nthe building into the blackness of the night.\n\n“Of course, up to this point, you will simply say that I had been\ndreaming—that so strong an impression had the character of my brain made\nupon me that it was a case of self-hypnosis. Wait until you have heard\nmy story to the end. It will prove to you, if your minds are open, that\nthere is some unknown, subtle force at work in our behalf, of which we\nknow nothing. To me, the only explanation is that our loved ones who\nhave gone before us are constantly seeking to serve us if we will but\ngive them the opportunity.\n\n“That Edith Morley was a real woman of flesh and blood, I am willing to\ntestify. I never saw her until I met her in my dream, vision, or\nwhatever you care to call it, yet I had described her accurately, even\nto her little traits of character, hours before when my sudden working\nstreak had brought her into my story. It may have been telepathy, but to\nme it was the work of the unseen forces I have just mentioned. I will\nshow you that she had been thinking of me at the very minute I was\nwriting of her—or, at least, there is no doubt of it in my mind. And,\ntoo, my mind was open to suggestion. But I digress.\n\n“Drawn by unseen hands, I walked on and on through the blackness of the\nnight until I reached an unfamiliar part of the city.\n\n“I swear that I had never been in that vicinity before, yet I knew\nexactly where to turn and what streets to take. I am not a sleep walker;\nI have a perfect recollection of making that long trip across the town,\nand on foot, mind you, yet I am certain that I was not fully awake. I\nwas more in the condition of a man in a daze.\n\n“My feet carried me to the door of a battered old brick tenement house.\nI climbed up four flights of stairs, rickety and dirty, lighted by smoky\nkerosene lamps. I had no idea where I was going, yet unseen hands were\nguiding me, pulling me along whenever I seemed to hesitate.\n\n“Before one of the doors on the fourth floor, I stopped. I rapped.\nReceiving no answer, I opened the door and entered.\n\n“She—Edith Morley—the girl of my dream—lay in a crumpled heap on the\nfloor! Every detail, even to the torn dress and the dark bruises on her\nwhite flesh, was just as it had appeared in my dream. Scattered about,\nnear where she had fallen, were the pieces of glass from the broken\nbottle. On one of them the death’s head grinned up at me as if chuckling\nat the grimness of it all. The pungent odor of bitter almonds filled the\nair.\n\n“In the corner stood a battered old dresser. Tucked in the cracked\nmirror was my picture, clipped from a newspaper review of one of my\nbooks. Below it was spread a letter, face upwards. It read :\n\n“ ‘I have done everything possible to fight off the inevitable. Death\nis all that remains. I am without money and without friends. If Twiggs\ncomes again tonight, I will kill myself. Please notify Mr. Martin Colby,\nthe novelist. He knows the North—my North! He does not know me, but I\nwould like him to know that I died like a true daughter of God’s\ncountry—the land we both love so well.’ ”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nEdith Morley\n\nColby arose and stretched his long arms above his head.\n\n“If you care for further proof, I have the letter that she left behind.”\nFor a second there was silence. Then Willoughby broke the strain. “Was\nshe—”\n\nColby nodded and said:\n\n“We never learned her name. I paid the expenses of her funeral and for\nthe headstone over her grave. On it I had carved the only name I knew\nher by, ‘Edith Morley.’ And beneath it I had these words engraved:\n\n“‘She left the world as clean as she, came into it’ ”\n\n~ The End ~\n\n"

But that fact doesn&#39;t keep them from trying. There is something about yellow metal which turns heads, transforms morals and grows devils in the soil of saints. Merely an instance of this is the case of the Hectopus mine, with which I, as a Post Office Inspector, was well acquainted for the space of a month.\n\nI had been called into the case on a complaint made by Jedidiah Quinot, of Boston, an esteemed gentleman of his community, who shed real tears, nearly wore out his glasses in polishings and blew his nose prodigiously as he told me the story of his suspicions concerning his harum-scarum nephew — one Herbert Cryder, whom he feared had not only hopelessly involved himself but disgraced the family in a gold mine speculation.\n\nAfter I had called upon Cryder, a few days later, I did not blame the old gentleman for his suspicions. If there ever was an outfit which bore all the marks of a fraud it was this Hectopus mine concern. As usual, it was quartered in the most expensive office building in the city, and the boss himself was twice as hard to see as the President of the United States. Inside the usual railing, with a boy at the gate, were a dozen stenographers copying names out of telephone directories or pages out of books — anything to keep them busy.\n\nIn a room opening off that was Dick Garrity, one of the shrewdest mine swindlers in America, with his name brazenly on the door and the title of &quot;General Manager.&quot; In the front office — when I finally got there — was the most impressive and expensive set of mahogany office furniture I have ever seen, and behind the big desk in the center of the room a clean-cut chap of about thirty, bronzed, smiling, devil-may-care and a most disarming way of waving a visitor to a chair and forcing him to take two cigars at once.\n\nAnd this was Herbert Cryder, a disgrace to his family, a worry to his old friends, suspected by the Government of being a thief, facing the world and Atlanta prison not only with a smile but with a laugh that refused to stay bottled.\n\nI had met many crooks but this was a new type, so new that I am afraid I made a poor job of my role as a prospective investor. As to that I do not know to this day whether he really suspected my errand or whether it was only a part of his plan when he laughed at my proposal to invest a few thousand dollars in the stock of the Hectopus Mining and Exploration Co., slapped me on the back and literally pushed me out into the hall with a third cigar clutched in my hand.\n\nWhatever he thought, he had left me no recourse but to go back to old Jedidiah with such information as I had been able to pick up on the outside, and the two of us spent the evening going over the cards we held in our hands and speculating on what the young scapegrace held in his.\n\nThat he was the most brazen young swindler outside a penitentiary, I was convinced. Jedidiah did not have to tell me that. Those girls in his outer office — twelve of them busy when there was not work enough for two — were the plainest sort of bait for the unwary. Dick Garrity, I knew, would be lost with an honest concern; he knew so much about mining that he wouldn&#39;t accept a gold piece in change at a bank. Then that mahogany office; it was far too gorgeous to be true. And as a crowning piece of effrontery, on the wall just behind Cryder&#39;s chair, was a picture — a painting at that — of an Indian spearing a fish from a little platform above a raging torrent. I had not noticed what kind of fish it was, but to me it looked like a sucker and I gasped almost aloud as I grasped the daring nerve of the laughing man who had placed it there.\n\nHerbert Cryder, I had found out, came of one of the best families in New England. Mixed in his blood somewhere must have been a strong element of the old-time whalers or sea captains of some sort because even as a boy he had been a daring, adventurous young devil. The more conservative expressed the opinion that it was God&#39;s mercy that his parents were dead, and even those who were still on good terms with him socially threw up their hands when his name was mentioned in casual conversation.\n\nOld Jedidiah had told me the young man had a long police record, and I wasted a whole day before I found out that this consisted of a score of arrests for crimes ranging from the theft of a barber&#39;s striped pole to an unproved charge of driving an automobile while intoxicated.\n\nI must have shown my disgust at such evidence because Quinot went to great pains to explain to me that his nephew was such a skilful liar that it had been impossible to convict him of numerous grave offenses of which he had undoubtedly been guilty, but I could not pin him down to just what these were.\n\nYoung Cryder, it seemed, according to Jedidiah, was absolutely untrustworthy where facts were concerned and a lover of mischief to such an extent that serious trouble had always been predicted for him.\n\n&quot;Why, do you know,&quot; said the old man, &quot;that scapegrace disappeared two years or so ago for six months and came back with a most remarkable tale about elephant shooting in East Africa. At my own expense I cabled to Nairobi and found he had never been there. Then what did he do? He produced two of the finest elephant tusks you ever saw and the foot of one of the beasts mounted as a humidor. Furthermore, he had the impudence to present the humidor to me — to me who had exposed him. There it is on the mantel. In my own club he met and talked for two hours with a man who had spent years in East Africa without making a single slip.&quot;\n\n&quot;Maybe he was there,&quot; I ventured.\n\n&quot;He certainly was not,&quot; Jedidiah replied with some heat. &quot;After I had been laughed at to such an extent that I did not dare visit my club, I investigated still further. He had spent those six months in Paris. He bought the elephant trophies by cable in London after I had questioned his story, and he spent a month reading every book on Africa and elephant hunting he could find.\n\n&quot;He isn&#39;t any mere fibber, Mr. Guernsey. When he sets out to tell a lie, he makes a thorough job of it.&quot;\n\nWith the picture of that wonderful office fresh in my mind, I was of the opinion that there was much strength in Jedidiah&#39;s opinion.\n\nThe Hectopus Mining and Exploration Co., it seemed, was in somewhat the same category as the elephant trophies. The story of the mine had followed another of the young man&#39;s more or less regular but mysterious absences. This time he had not told where he had been, but lent an air of mystery to his recent experiences. For three or four weeks after his reappearance at home he had gone about clad in laced boots and wearing a tourist-style Stetson, khaki riding breeches and a Norfolk jacket. His face was bronzed, his hands calloused and he had cultivated a drawl that might have been acquired in Georgia, Arizona or the Blue Ridge mountains. To all inquiries as to where he had been, he had replied by placing a finger to his lips, glancing furtively about and whispering the one word — &quot;Gold.&quot;\n\nAccording to Quinot, his nephew had followed up this bit of playacting with a lie as elaborate as the elephant story. But with this difference — he had commercialized his mendacity. In the case of the elephant he had reached his climax by the gift of the humidor trophy to his indignant uncle; in the present episode he had gone to the length of selling for money stock in a gold mine which did not exist.\n\n&quot;Why?&quot; had been about the third question I asked when I started the investigation.\n\nThe answer was simple enough. Herbert Cryder was &quot;broke.&quot; One cannot go on forever playing practical jokes which involve such expenses as a pair of elephant tusks and the like indefinitely unless one is a multimillionare. And this our young friend was not. He had inherited about $150,000 from his father and apparently started out to spend it on a million dollar scale. Just before he vanished on the trip that preceded the gold mine story, he was known to be playing heavily in the market and the result had evidently been disastrous. He had admitted as much — talked about it quite openly, in fact — and the news was common gossip.\n\nThere was a further motive which Jedidiah explained to me at length and which sounded perfectly logical after I had induced him to talk. He did not want to tell me anything about it at first, saying it was purely a family matter.\n\nIt seemed that Cryder was in line for another fortune — a big one this time, amounting to about three-quarters of a million. This was the estate of a childless old uncle of whom he had once been the favorite but in whose &quot;black book&quot; his escapades had enrolled him time and again. If Cryder could tide matters over until the death of this uncle, Quinot demonstrated, and at the same time appear to have settled down as a solid business man, he would be fixed for life. It all sounded simple enough to me. The old uncle was apparently already on his death bed, with stocks of the Hectopus in his vaults, and all Cryder had to guard against was a speedy exposure.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nHerb&#39;s Latest\n\nTo those of us who knew these facts it was plain that behind his laughing mask young Cryder was nothing less than a desperate adventurer, staking his wits and his nerve against time and fate in a game for the fortune of old Ezekiel Cryder.\n\nIt had been about a year, I learned, since Cryder had appeared at home in his Wild West outfit and mysteriously whispered about gold. At first his friends had merely laughed among themselves at what they called &quot;Herb&#39;s latest,&quot; but finally Cryder had begun to scatter a few nuggets around as souvenir gifts in the form of scarf pins, cuff links and one thing and another, and he even tried to pay for a round of drinks out of a &quot;poke&quot; of gold dust. Raised quite a row, it seems, because they didn&#39;t have gold scales at the cashier&#39;s desk to weigh it, like they do in a new mining camp.\n\nPretty soon his friends were demanding to buy shares in the mine. Cryder had laughed at them, just like he laughed at me, but they kept at him and persuaded him — as they thought — to form a company and issue stock. He sold it cheap enough — ten dollars for a $100 share — but apparently he had sold quite a lot — nobody knew then just how much.\n\nHe had pretended that he wanted to keep it a close corporation — so that he could have full control himself, he said — and wouldn&#39;t sell to anyone except close friends and relatives. Old Ezekiel bought quite a block and even Jedidiah bought some. He had an honest young lawyer as &quot;general counsel,&quot; and almost at the start declared a dividend of ten per cent.\n\nThe stock certificates were beautifully engraved and the prospectus was a work of art. I read it through three times before I discovered that it was all generalities and that nowhere in it was the mine definitely located. It was, some place that the book described as the &quot;El Dorado of the Munificent West,&quot; and that&#39;s no place to buy a railroad ticket to.\n\nIt was after the dividend that he hired Garrity and the ten extra stenographers and opened the mahogany offices. Several of his friends got pinched in the market about that time and sold their stock to strangers. These began calling for information and reports and things, and young Cryder did not laugh as much as he used to, folks said. Something was really worrying him. In another week Jedidiah Quinot, among others, became suspicious and he would have carried the tale to old Ezekiel had not the physicians forbidden him to see the sick man. As a result of this, he had appealed to the Department and I was put on the case.\n\nOf course I could have gone straight to Cryder, showed my credentials and demanded his books, the location of the mine and all the rest of the information I wanted, but Cryder was supposedly a citizen of some importance in that community — no common crook — and besides that there kept buzzing in the back of my mind a lingering suspicion of Jedidiah Quinot, the chief complainant in the case. While he seemed to be all broken up over the matter, nevertheless I had found out that in case old Ezekiel Cryder disinherited his nephew, his fortune would go to Quinot&#39;s son.\n\nSo, instead of declaring myself to Herbert Cryder, I called on his &quot;general manager,&quot; Mr. Richard Garrity. Dick was not exactly pleased to see me when I ran across him in the lobby of his hotel, but he was quite willing to renew our acquaintance and talk at length. Garrity had been wondering for some time why I did not send him to the penitentiary and seemed to think it was because I had use for him outside. The fact was I did not have the evidence but he thought I had and I was willing to let him hold that belief. It certainly helped in this case.\n\n&quot;Where&#39;s the mine?&quot; echoed Garrity in response to my first pointed question. &quot;There isn&#39;t any mine. I don&#39;t sabe the game myself and I don&#39;t ask too many questions but I know that. Why, I wrote that prospectus myself and it&#39;s a dandy, if I do say it. I&#39;m drawing down good money as a coach for the young man because he&#39;s never even seen a gold mine. Outside of that he don&#39;t need any help from me. Why, Guernsey, this Cryder is such a magnificent liar that he makes me ashamed of myself. Sometimes when he&#39;s talking for effect I can just see that old Hectopus mine, with men shoveling out gold, big mountains all around and the thriving city that&#39;s springing up there in the wilderness. Honest, it is a pretty picture that forms while he&#39;s talking.\n\n&quot;But the samples,&quot; I asked. &quot;Where does he get his samples — his nuggets and gold dust, and so on?&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, those things,&quot; Garrity answered with a laugh. &quot;Why, he bought those nugget pins and cuff buttons in Seattle. They&#39;re quite common out there — made out of Alaskan gold. I bought the gold dust right here in town, and to make it look proper I sent West for some black sand that the gold is usually found in a placer diggings. That&#39;s easy enough to find but there isn&#39;t usually more than a trace of gold in it. All I did was mix some dust and small nuggets in with the sand and we had the raw product &#39;fresh from the Hectopus,&#39; as Cryder says.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s been funny, Guernsey,&quot; he concluded. &quot;It&#39;s been good fun and good pay, too, but I suppose it&#39;s all over now. Say, isn&#39;t there any chance to save the young fellow from going to the pen? He&#39;s a helluva good scout.&quot;\n\nGarrity really seemed to be in earnest about this end of the matter and I was puzzled. Sentiment was a new quality in Dick.\n\n&quot;But why did he do it?&quot; I asked. &quot;What&#39;s behind it all?&quot;\n\n&quot;Broke, they say,&quot; said Garrity. &quot;But damned if I know really what it is all about. He seems to have plenty of money. That dividend was his own idea, and he paid out over $10,000 in cash on it without turning a hair. For a guy who&#39;s broke, he&#39;s about the nerviest gambler I&#39;ve ever struck because we did not need to pay that dividend a-tall. I just want to show them how good this mine really is,&#39; he says to me, with a twinkle in his eye. And all I could do was just set there and stare at him with my mouth open.\n\n&quot;Why, if this was my deal, Guernsey, and I had this guy for a &#39;dummy&#39; president, I could clean up a hundred thousand here in a month and beat it for Russia or Bones Airs or some place where even you couldn&#39;t get me. But this Cryder fellow — why, he seems to get all het up every time anybody tries to buy some stock and spends more time telling the suckers he&#39;s already landed what a great mine it is, than he does figuring out where the money for the next dividend is coming from.&quot;\n\n&quot;Is he going to pay another?&quot; I asked, startled, for this was news to me.\n\n&quot;He sure is. It&#39;s already announced for October — that&#39;s six weeks from now, and I happen to know that there isn&#39;t money enough in our acqount to more than half meet it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then you — think — &quot; I ventured.\n\n&quot;Look here, Guernsey,&quot; said Garrity, reaching over and laying his hand on my knee. &quot;I&#39;ve come clean on this and I&#39;ll go further. I know some other things that you&#39;d like to know — things that would help you a lot in Washington. Isn&#39;t there some chance for Cryder? Can&#39;t we make him see that he&#39;s in over his head and get a settlement before it&#39;s too late. I can&#39;t — I just can&#39;t see that boy go over the road.&quot;\n\nThere it was again — Dick Garrity with sentiment in his soul — the unknown quantity heretofore in that old swindler. Herbert Cryder, I decided, must be a regular fellow, and with the determination to visit him in the morning in my proper guise, I went to bed.\n\nBut in the morning Cryder had disappeared. Garrity was waiting for me, white of face, at the foot of the elevator shaft with the news. He had found a note on his desk, he said, instructing him to keep the office open as usual, and inclosing a check for $3,000 for expenses while he was gone.\n\n&quot;Where did he say he was going?&quot; I demanded.\n\nGarrity sighed as he produced the note.\n\n&quot;To visit the mine,&quot; he said, and added plaintively: &quot;Do you suppose the boy&#39;s lost his mind entirely. You know and I know, Guernsey, there&#39;s no more Hectopus mine than that elm over there in the park is a plum tree.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Ten-Thousand-And-First\n\nI was rather glad of the change. The new development gave me a chance to get out into the open. Trailing men across wide stretches always was more in my line than trailing plots through the pages of ledgers and letter files. Dick helped me, both because he was afraid of me and anxious to save his boss from something he could not understand — and before noon I was aboard a train and speeding for Montreal.\n\nNo, I did not have any thought that he had fled to Canada to escape from me. He had no idea who I was and also, Canada is no safe refuge for evil-doing Americans. Maybe it was once, but not in my time. I had no notion why he had gone there except a suspicion that he might have a confederate on the other side of the border who would provide the funds for the October dividend.\n\nBut that wasn&#39;t it. Cryder stayed in Montreal just long enough to catch the limited for the West Coast. The news of that rather staggered me and I missed the next train after him raising money enough to follow. You know we are not supposed to go outside the United States without a lot of red tape being unwound, but this Cryder fellow had sort of got my goat and I borrowed some coin from some Canadian officers I knew and went ahead with just a few cards of introduction from them instead of new credentials from Washington. We have to do that occasionally. If we make good, we are praised; if we get into a jam, we get fired.\n\nCryder was an easy man to follow on this trip, and I had plenty of leisure to enjoy my journey across the continent. I don&#39;t mean that the young fellow was leaving any broad trail of empty bottles and twenty dollar tips along the right of way of the Canadian Pacific, but he was making himself known to every one he met and his scintillating personality was one to be remembered. All along I found that he had talked nothing but mines and mining and that he had made a trip up into Edmonton to look into the Fort Norman reports of gold and oil along the Mackenzie.\n\nI almost missed him there and had to double back from Banff before I picked up his trail. I lost it again after I passed Field, B. C., on my second dash for the coast, and had to come back — carefully this time — before I found he had left the main highway at a little town called Hope, perched between the mountains and the Fraser River Canyon and struck off into the hills.\n\nThere is still gold along the Fraser. On the sand bars that ridge the rushing torrent every half mile or so, Chinamen can still be seen washing the sands of the river and turning &quot;color&quot; with almost every pan. But the best of them average only about two dollars a day and white men merely laugh as they pass them by. It doesn&#39;t pay for grub, hardship and loneliness. But this was a great country once. Back in the 50&#39;s Hope was a great outfitting point for a stampede of Americans who had failed to find fortunes at the first few turns of a shovel in the California rush, and chased the rainbow a thousand miles northward rather than return East empty handed.\n\nThere certainly is gold in the Fraser. Everyone could see that. But the tossing, heaving, rushing waters knew nothing of its value. Only on the sandbars could it be found and the rambunctious river tore these down over night and erected new ones every morning. Every miner knows that gold in rivers is washed down from the hills and for seventy years prospectors have been seeking the &quot;mother lode&quot; of the Fraser deposits.\n\nTen thousand hopeful men have crossed the hills from Hope to seek this treasure house of Nature. Herbert Cryder, I soon found out, had been the ten-thousand-and-first.\n\nThere was no concealment about his journey. He was easier to follow than a new yellow freight car. The guides who had taken him into the hills were already back in Hope when I arrived there, and perfectly willing to repeat their thirty-six hour journey with no questions asked. In fact, they volunteered the information that Cryder had bought an abandoned claim without even looking at it, and taken a crew of six men — fully equipped with grub and tools for placer work in with him. The head man of the pack train tapped his forehead and winked solemnly as he told me about it, but beyond that he was non-communicative. As for me, I walked down to the river and looked at the waters as they rushed through the canyon on their way to the sea, the snow-capped mountains from which the flood had tumbled and the ruined little town which still clung to its post between the railroad and the torrent, and pinched myself to retain the idea that I was an officer of the United States Government in pursuit of a criminal.\n\nThey had told me there was but one trail across the hills to Cryder&#39;s claim, but apparently they did not know Cryder. Because, when we arrived at his camp, he was not there. &quot;Gone back to the Fraser to spear salmon,&quot; a disgusted Irish laborer informed me as he took a fresh grip on his shovel.\n\nIt was dusk then and I was tired out from unaccustomed pony travel over the rough trail. I was glad enough to accept the foreman&#39;s offer of supper and a bed in his tent and put off any further investigation until morning. Tired as I was, the foreman and I talked together well into the night and long after he had begun snoring I lay awake thinking over the things he had told me. I could not believe them. As nearly as I dared I had called the man a liar and accused him of being in league with Cryder. He had refused to talk at all until I had shown him my American credentials — worthless in British Columbia, but he did not know that. Then I found myself facing again that strange loyalty and sentimentality in this rough mine-workman that I had found in Dick Garrity, soft-palmed swindler.\n\nCould Cryder&#39;s swindle be as far-reaching as this, I wondered. Could he possibly have enlisted and coached this man in three days and then brazenly left him here alone. I knew that Cryder had never been in the district before. I knew that McGuire, the foreman, was a native of Hope. I knew that all Cryder had done in the camp was to take a few snapshots after the men he had brought in had started digging and put up a sign he had had painted in Hope. The sign was non-committal. It was merely a white board with black lettering planted against the face of a huge cliff. &quot;Hectopus Mine,&quot; was all it said.\n\nTwo days later I was again walking the brink of the Fraser River Canyon. I was waiting for Cryder — reported somewhere in the neighborhood — and for a train. A hundred feet below me the same river boiled and swirled. It might have been the same water I had first seen, turning a corner and returning, so eternal was the tumult. It seemed as though the Fraser were composed of liquid hills and valleys, so firmly did the currents force the water into fantastic moulds.\n\nTurning a bend in the stream in a longer cast for views, I finally came upon a spectacle that was strangely familiar. Far down below me was a tiny platform made of driftwood on driftwood piles, and upon it perched an Indian with a long spear. His lance darted once into the tumbling water and was withdrawn with a huge fish squirming on its point. A salmon, I knew, and with the knowledge came recollection. This was a picture almost the same as the painting over Cryder&#39;s desk. I had wronged the man from the start. Not suckers but game fish; that was his ideal.\n\nEven as I looked, another figure clambered to the little platform — Cryder himself. I could see the Indian shake his head and motion him back with his hand, but Cryder climbed on and strode out upon the platform. It showed he was new to the country. The little perch was safe enough for the Indian, but under the second man&#39;s two hundred pounds it buckled, swayed, collapsed, and both were thrown into the torrent, fifty yards above me.\n\nI have said that I knew at the start that Cryder was no ordinary crook. I have told about the strange sentimentality of Garrity and McGuire. I have said nothing about my own feelings. I doubt if I had analyzed them myself. But I held my breath as I saw him fall and, almost before I knew it, had peeled my coat and plunged into the Fraser after him. I am a rather strong swimmer or I would not be alive to tell this today. The Indian helped me a little at first but Cryder had got a bump on the head and was a drag on both of us. Next minute the Indian was crashed against a rock and only managed to struggle ashore. I finally landed Cryder a mile down the canyon where the current, rather than I, washed us on a sandbar where a Chinaman was stolidly panning out gold.\n\nFrom some place the Chink produced a bottle of alcohol, or gin, I don&#39;t know which, and finally Cryder opened his eyes. He did not remember ever having seen me before and was a little &quot;woozy,&quot; I suppose.\n\n&quot;How do you feel, Cryder?&quot; I asked.\n\n&quot;You know my name?&quot; he asked. &quot;Who are you?&quot;\n\n&quot;Guernsey&#39;s my name,&quot; I said. &quot;United States Post Office Inspector.&quot;\n\n&quot;What are you doing way up here?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve been following you for a month or so.&quot;\n\nCryder sighed and closed his eyes again.\n\n&quot;Oh, hell,&quot; he said, finally. &quot;All that fuss. I&#39;ll pay out all right. There&#39;s two hundred thousand in the bank. I&#39;m not broke. I made a fortune in that stock deal and told everybody I was broke. Please let me go on with it. I must get back with these pictures of the mine and drive old Jedidiah out of his club again. It&#39;ll only cost me about twenty thousand more and it&#39;s well worth it. I&#39;ve spent so much time on it and it&#39;s such a grand yarn.&quot;\n\nI shook him by the shoulder.\n\n&quot;But it&#39;s not like you to deceive people in this manner,&quot; I shouted in his ear.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t you worry about that,&quot; he answered. &quot;Jedidiah is only waiting to steal the pennies off Uncle Zeke&#39;s eyes. I just wanted to get that old double-crosser so good he wouldn&#39;t dare hold his head up. I wanted to show everybody who was the better business man — me or him. I guess I&#39;ve done it. I&#39;ve done something nobody ever did before. I&#39;ve sold stock in a mine that never existed, paid dividends on it, made them want to emigrate out here, and now I&#39;ve provided them with a spot to emigrate to. The big joke will come when Jedidiah gets out here and tries to find the gold.&quot;\n\nI thought he had fainted in earnest, when his voice trailed off in a whisper at the close. But he rallied again and opened his eyes with a faint but whimsical smile.\n\n&quot;Cryder,&quot; I shouted. &quot;There is gold in the Hectopus. McGuire has found a pocket that is worth a quarter of a million dollars if it is worth a cent. Do you hear me?&quot;\n\nThe smile on his face broadened, then was replaced by a frown.\n\n&quot;Hell,&quot; he muttered. &quot;All that time wasted. And it was such a perfectly beautiful lie.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Hurrying after the broad shoulders of Sullivan, jostling through the crowd of workers going home after their day&#39;s work, the reporter, who was just starting his daily task, knew something was up. Larry never walked that way unless he was on a case.\n\nLike Alice following the rabbit, the reporter saw Larry duck into a subway kiosk, and disappear from the earth; but this was no wonder to a New Yorker. The reporter, with a dash forward, managed to push through the gate two paces behind the detective. With two bounds and a leap, he was inside the closing door of an express, pressing up against the detective.\n\n&quot;Why the hurry?&quot;\n\nLarry managed to turn his broad, good-natured face toward the reporter.\n\n&quot;Oh, it&#39;s you, is it?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes. What&#39;s up?&quot;\n\nLarry shook his head gravely. &quot;Poison case.&quot; he said, in a low tone. &quot;Old lady. Can&#39;t talk here. Wait!&quot;\n\nAt Seventy-second Street, Larry was pushed out onto the platform, the reporter in front of him. The detective hurried up the subway steps into the dusk.\n\n&quot;Special detail,&quot; he said in explanation.\n\nThey walked west, and on a cross-street Larry found a brownstone front where he rang the bell and was admitted by a uniformed officer.\n\n&quot;Where&#39;s the body?&quot; asked the detective.\n\n&quot;On the second floor,&quot; said Murphy the cop.\n\nFollowed by his shadow, Larry mounted to the second- floor front and entered a room which contained but one occupant — a dead body.\n\nHats off, the two stood for a moment contemplating the scene; then the detective, with a sigh, switched on more lights and pulled back the sheet. On the bed lay the body of an old woman, clothed in black silk. Even in death she seemed majestic; her face was tilted proudly and the staring eyes were stern.\n\n&quot;Where&#39;s the doctor?&quot; called Larry, going to the door.\n\nA man&#39;s voice answered. &quot;He was called away, sir; he said there was no hope, that she was dead.&quot;\n\n&quot;Who&#39;re you?&quot; asked Larry.\n\n&quot;The butler, sir. William Frinn.&quot;\n\nLooking over the detective&#39;s shoulder, the reporter saw a tall, thin, dark-haired man of about thirty-five, with high cheek hones. From down the hall came the sound of sobs.\n\n&quot;Who&#39;s crying?&quot;\n\n&quot;That is the cook, sir, Margaret Brown.&quot;\n\n&quot;Anybody else in the house?&quot;\n\n&quot;Anna the housemaid, sir. And Mr. Francis will be here shortly. He is the madame&#39;s nephew. Mr. Francis Small,&quot; added the butler, as Larry&#39;s lips opened.\n\n&quot;This lady is Mrs. Emma Wilton,&quot; said Larry, consulting a note-book. &quot;Doctor said she&#39;d been poisoned. Did he say what it was?&quot;\n\nFrinn shook his head. &quot;No, sir. He said the chemist must make an examination.&quot;\n\nSullivan nodded. &quot;Come inside,&quot; he said to Frinn. &quot;I want to ask you some more questions — wait, better go into the next room. Switch off the lights,&quot; he said to the reporter.\n\nFrinn answered the detective&#39;s questions. Mrs. Wilton was very wealthy. Yes, she was a widow, and had no children of her own. Yes, Mr. Francis Small, her brother&#39;s son, lived there. He was a chemist.\n\n&quot;Any idea who did this?&quot; asked Larry.\n\n&quot;No, sir,&quot; he answered.\n\n&quot;H&#39;m,&quot; said Larry.\n\nAfter getting the details, the reporter left.\n\nIt was some weeks later that he obtained full knowledge of the case. From time to time, as the days ran into weeks, he would question Sullivan about it; but the detective was reticent.\n\nIt was Larry who volunteered the story of his own free will, one night after he had come off duty.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThis Bird Small\n\nYou kept asking me about that poison case — Mrs. Wilton, the old lady, y&#39; know [said Larry]. Well, it&#39;s cleared up at last. I&#39;ll spill it-to you.\n\nShe was a widow, with no children living, and had plenty of jack. She lived there in that house, with her nephew, Francis Small, a medium-sized, brown-haired bird, with round head and glasses — he came in a little while after you left. He was about thirty.\n\nHe was very much broken up at the death of his aunt — or he acted that way. I had pumped Frinn the butler for all I was worth. He seemed to he holding something back, and I determined to find out what it was.\n\nThe maid and the cook were O.K. The cook was afraid they&#39;d accuse her of poisoning the old lady.\n\nWell, on the third floor this bird Small, who was an expert chemist and very smart in his line, had a laboratory of his own. I saw it that evening. It covered the whole of the top floor, and he had it all fitted out pretty, with all sorts of glass stuff and all kinds of chemicals labeled neatly in bottles and boxes on shelves.\n\nAn analysis was made by the department chemist; he found the old lady had been fed arsenic.\n\nSo far, no arrests had been made. I had men watching the house, and tailing the butler and Small. In Small&#39;s laboratory I found plenty of arsenic.\n\nFrom the housemaid I learned something else. Small brought his aunt a box of candy from time to time; in her desk I found the remains of some candy she&#39;d had.\n\nAfter analysis, it proved to contain arsenic, the same form of arsenic as was in the jars in Small&#39;s laboratory. At that, I put him under arrest.\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t do it,&quot; he kept saying. &quot;It&#39;s terrible!&quot;\n\nThe poor sap seemed to think he would be believed. He put up no fight at all, just came along like a lamb.\n\nThe motive was easy to find. The nephew came in for all Mrs. Wilton&#39;s jack; and he needed more money.\n\nThe candy would be enough to give him the juice. But after he had been arrested, I questioned the servants.\n\nFrom them I drew out bit by bit more damning evidence against Small. The nephew often brought his aunt candy and fruit; he had a hot temper, and spent a great deal upon women. He was a wild guy in that way, and his aunt often worried about him. Also, he had big ideas. He was a great chemist all right, and had spent a lot of the old lady&#39;s money on expensive experiments. Just before she was poisoned they had had several violent quarrels, due to the fact that Mrs. Wilton would not give him enough cash to start a big manufacturing business of his own.\n\nThe evidence was iron-bound. I didn&#39;t have a doubt but what Small had slipped the old lady the arsenic.\n\nBut he wouldn&#39;t confess. And he had no idea of who might have done it, nor could he give me anyone else who might have a motive in killing the old lady.\n\nCould you ask for a stronger case?\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Chemist With A Brain In His Head\n\nI was feeling pretty good on having got it worked I out so nice, when the department chemist, who&#39;d done the analyzing in the case, took some of the wind out of my sails.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s only one thing makes me think maybe Small didn&#39;t do it,&quot; says Smith the chemist.\n\n&quot;And there&#39;s a dozen makes me think he did,&quot; says I.\n\nSmith laughed.\n\n&quot;It sure looks like it,&quot; says he. &quot;But I&#39;ve been thinking it over. Was he drunk when he planted that arsenic?&quot;\n\n&quot;Why, no,&quot; says I. &quot;He wanted to croak her, and he did it that way, thinking we wouldn&#39;t get on to him.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ha, ha!&quot; says Smith, not really laughing, but razzing me, &quot;D&#39;you think any chemist with a brain in his head would poison anybody with arsenic? Why, man, it&#39;s so damn easy to find you can dig up a body ten years gone and find it powdering the bones! It stays in the stomach lining, in hard white bits, and I can trace it with my eyes closed. No one but a damn fool or a drunken man would shoot anybody arsenic.&quot;\n\n&quot;Is that the only reason you got for thinking Small didn&#39;t do it?&quot; says I.\n\n&quot;Yes. And it&#39;s a pretty good one, too, Larry,&quot; says Smith. &quot;A man with Small&#39;s knowledge of poisons and chemicals could have used rare vegetable poisons that would have kept me working till doomsday, and I&#39;d never have found them then. Even potassium cyanide would have been quicker and better, and by the time I got the body, it would have been gone. Maybe the sawbones would have been wise to it; but it goes to pieces in a few hours.&quot;\n\nHis words took hold of me. Did I want to have an innocent man get a couple of thousand volts through him?\n\nI kept telling myself it was O.K.; that Small had done it and would confess soon. His lawyer was the only person we let see him.\n\nNext day after my talk with Smith, I went to see the prisoner, who had been indicted. He was haggard, and very unhappy; he looked at me with sore eyes. He didn&#39;t seem to hold any grudge against me.\n\n&quot;How about coming across, Small?&quot; says I, trying to be decent as possible. &quot;The case is clear against you. You&#39;ll save a hell of a lot of trouble if you&#39;ll talk.&quot;\n\nHe shook his head. &quot;My lawyer says I&#39;m not to speak to anybody,&quot; says he.\n\n&quot;Why&#39;d you use arsenic?&quot; I asked him.\n\nHe shook his head again. &quot;I didn&#39;t do it,&quot; he said.\n\nI left him sitting on his bench with his head in his hands. I wandered out into the waiting-room — and say, there sat one of the niftiest little dames I ever saw. &quot;Waiting to see a prisoner,&quot; says I to myself.\n\nShe was sitting there alone, a handkerchief over her eyes. Every once in a while she sobbed.\n\nBeauty in distress always gets my goat. I went over to her, though it was none of my business.\n\n&quot;Excuse me, lady,&quot; says I, &quot;but is there anything I can do to help you ?&quot;\n\nShe turned up her tear-stained face. She was a nifty, believe me! Big blue eyes, light blonde hair, not bobbed, a neat little figure and a pretty soft voice.\n\n&quot;They — they won&#39;t let me see him,&quot; says she.\n\n&quot;Won&#39;t let you see who?&quot; I asks her.\n\n&quot;Francis — Mr. Small.&quot;\n\nI jumped a mile. &quot;Oh,&quot; says I, &quot;you&#39;re his sweetie, are you?&quot;\n\nShe didn&#39;t get sore, she was too worked up. She just nodded and went on crying.\n\nI sat down beside her.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m interested in Mr. Small&#39;s case, too,&quot; says I softly. &quot;It&#39;s a shame. I don&#39;t think he did it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, I know he didn&#39;t,&quot; she cried. &quot;He was too good and kind. He loved his aunt. They had little squabbles sometimes, but it didn&#39;t amount to anything. I know he didn&#39;t poison her.&quot;\n\n&quot;If he didn&#39;t,&quot; says I, &quot;who did?&quot;\n\nShe shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; says she.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nMiss Marie Simmons\n\nThinks I, I will tail you, little one, and see what happens. You see, Smith&#39;s words had got my goat and I wanted more proof that I was right. I got up and went off, after a word or two of sympathy, and waited for her to come out.\n\nShe did at last, and I followed her to a joint on the upper West Side where she had an apartment.\n\nThe janitor winked at me when I&#39;d identified myself and asked him about her. &quot;That&#39;s Miss Marie Simmons,&quot; says he.\n\n&quot;And what&#39;s the wink mean?&quot; says I.\n\n&quot;She&#39;s got a sweetie, a good-looking young man with plenty of money, who pays her rent. He is away now, I guess, because I ain&#39;t seen him for some time.&quot;\n\n&quot;What&#39;s he look like?&quot; I asked.\n\nHe told me. It was Small, without doubt.\n\nWell, I couldn&#39;t blame him. She was a peach. I hung around there, hoping to get another glimpse of her, and about seven o&#39;clock she came out and had a bite to eat in a restaurant, and then started back.\n\nI was tailing her, thinking what a beauty she was and wondering why I&#39;d been born poor, when I saw a tall bird step out of a doorway near her house and stop her.\n\nAt first, I thought he was a masher; then I saw that though she shrank from him a little, she knew him.\n\nI managed to get within ten feet of them, as they turned into her doorway. I was right round the corner; they were standing in the outside hall having words,\n\n&quot; — why won&#39;t you?&quot; the guy was saying — and as soon as I heard his voice I jumped, because I knew it. It was that butler, Frinn. He had gone off after we had cleared up the case, and, though we were to use him as a star witness in the trial, he had not been watched.\n\n&quot;Because I don&#39;t love you,&quot; the girl says.\n\n&quot;You love that dirty murderer, don&#39;t you?&quot; Frinn says with a sneer. &quot;He&#39;ll be dead soon. What will you do then?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll kill myself,&quot; says she.\n\nFrinn laughed. &quot;Oh, no you won&#39;t,&quot; says he. &quot;Marie, you were a foolish girl to go with him. You should not have looked above your station; you see what it has brought you to.&quot;\n\nThe girl refused to talk to him any longer; she flung inside the house and I had just time to duck out of sight as Frinn, scowling and mumbling to himself, jazzed out of the doorway and up the street.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nGoing Above My Station\n\nWell, inside of ten minutes I was in the girl&#39;s apartment.\n\n&quot;Listen,&quot; says I sternly. &quot;You come clean, little one. Come across. Who are you?&quot;\n\n&quot;Why — &quot; says she, starting to act indignant, but I stopped her.\n\n&quot;You little fool,&quot; says I, &quot;d&#39;you want to go to the station with me? D&#39;you want to see your sweetie Small convicted of murder? Come clean, or it&#39;ll be hell for you all around, understand?&quot;\n\n&quot;What — what do you want to know ?&quot; says she faintly.\n\n&quot;I know you and Small were thick,&quot; says I quickly. &quot;But where does this tall buzzard Frinn come in? What&#39;d he mean by your going above your station?&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, that,&quot; says she, her eyes round when she saw I had overheard her talk with Frinn. &quot;I used to be personal maid to Mrs. Wilton. William the butler was in love with me; he asked me to marry him and I nearly did. But then, Francis made love to me, and I jilted William. That&#39;s what he meant by my going above my station.&quot;\n\n&quot;F&#39;heavens&#39; sakes!&quot; says I, with a yell.\n\nThere was the clue. There was the motive, and the man.\n\nBut it was a slender thread. Nothing proved, nothing but a shadow over the iron-bound case against Small.\n\nHow the hell was I to get Frinn — that is, if he had done it?\n\nIt took me an hour to figure it out. Then I told the girl what she was to do.\n\n&quot;Remember, it&#39;s the only way to save your sweetie,&quot; says I. &quot;Play your part well.&quot;\n\nThe next evening she dressed herself up pretty, and went to Frinn&#39;s address, a boarding-house near Columbus Avenue. She got him easy enough, and brought him back to her apartment.\n\nHe was quiet at first; sat there smoking the cigarette she gave him. She took a seat beside him.\n\nThen she gave him a drink or two.\n\n&quot;William,&quot; says she, softly, &quot;I want to ask you to forgive me. That&#39;s why I brought you here. You were always good to me — too good, and I&#39;ve been a foolish girl.&quot;\n\nHe was a little wary of her at first. &quot;This is a sudden change from last night,&quot; says he.\n\nThen she pulled what I thought was pretty hot stuff. &quot;William,&quot; says she, clenching her little white fists, &quot;I&#39;ve found something out about — about Francis — Mr. Small. I — I loved him, and trusted him. And do you know what he has been doing? He had another girl and he has been lying to me all along. He has been making a fool of me. It nearly broke my heart; then I realized that I had never really loved him and it was easy to hate him. He made a fool of me, William. Oh, I&#39;m so ashamed!&quot;\n\nAnd she started to cry. It was working pretty.\n\n&quot;I — I have no one to help me, no one to take care of me,&quot; says she, between sobs. &quot;What will I do?&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll take care of you, darling,&quot; he says. &quot;Marry me.&quot; He was crazy for that girl, you could see it in his eyes. She threw her arms around his neck and kissed him. &quot;I will,&quot; she says.\n\nFor an hour Frinn hugged her and kissed her, and she filled him full of liquor and bull. I was getting cramped up, hiding in the closet behind the couch, with a peek-hole I&#39;d made to look through.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nI Poisoned The Old Lady\n\nFrinn was getting drunk; he was basking in her smile, and she was soft-soaping him.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t see why you didn&#39;t kill him, William,&quot; says she suddenly. &quot;I would have, if I&#39;d been you. I thought you weren&#39;t very brave to let me go the way you did.&quot;\n\nFrinn didn&#39;t say anything for a moment; then he says, thickly, &quot;I did kill him, Marie. At least, he&#39;s as good as dead.&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you mean?&quot; says she.\n\nFrinn hesitated. The girl prodded him with a word or two. &quot;I hate him,&quot; says she. &quot;Tell me, William. I love you. I wish you had killed him.&quot;\n\n&quot;I poisoned the old lady,&quot; says Frinn, suddenly, hissing the words so that I could scarcely hear. &quot;I did it to get you back, honey. I planted the arsenic in that candy Small brought; I took it out of his laboratory. I did it for you, darling. He&#39;ll be convicted of murder and then we&#39;ll both have our revenge.&quot;\n\nHot dog! I stepped out from the closet then, and stood before him. He nearly passed out; he went yellow and green, and then a sickly white.\n\n&quot;What — &quot; he gasps.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re under arrest,&quot; says I, &quot;for the murder of Mrs. Wilton.&quot;\n\n&quot;God!&quot; he gasped. Then he let out a scream. &quot;You hell-cat!&quot; he howled, making a pass at the dame, who had listened with gleaming eyes as she saw her sweetie Small saved from death.\n\nShe screamed; she was between me and the guy and I couldn&#39;t get him. He lunged at her with a knife, but I kicked it out of his hand and covered him.\n\n&quot;Stop!&quot; says I, &quot;or I&#39;ll shoot you full of lead.&quot;\n\n&quot;Damn you!&quot; he yelled, and he came at me like a wild man. I fired, trying to wing him; got him in the arm, but he didn&#39;t stop, and we crashed over the couch and fell in a heap on the rug.\n\nWell, there was quite a wrestling match for a time; he was wild, and goofy at that.\n\nEven while I was battling, I was happy. Because I knew I had him for sure. If he had denied his confession it would have been hard to prove; he could have said he was filling the girl full of hop to make an impression.\n\nAt last, after he&#39;d batted me around some, I got a strangle-hold on him, and put all my juice into it. He kicked and gasped; the girl had run screaming for help, but by the time the cop came I had Frinn subdued.\n\n***\n\nLarry stopped. The reporter had taken down the story. &quot;You&#39;ll let me use it?&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;Sure,&quot; said the big detective. &quot;Help yourself. We&#39;ve got Frinn cold. He came across and confessed again, when he saw there was no use. He&#39;ll get it. Small was released.&quot;\n\n&quot;And the girl?&quot; asked the reporter.\n\n&quot;Oh, she&#39;s all right,&quot; said Larry. &quot;I think Small&#39;s going to marry her. She surely saved his neck.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  The Robbery\n  A Friend\n  The Ten Grand\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Robbery\n\nWhen Jake entered his hotel room at midnight he almost bumped into the black snout of the automatic. Behind the automatic was a slim man who wore a mask.\n\n&quot;How&#39;d you get in here?&quot;\n\n&quot;Through the window. I want ten grand.&quot;\n\nJake had seen plenty in twenty-some years as a fight-manager but the suddenness of this holdup had him surprised. He glanced at the window. He stalled. &quot;What ten grand?&quot; &quot;You&#39;re managin&#39; Kid Watson. The Kid outpointed Inky Stevens tonight at Grand Arena. Kick through.&quot;\n\nJake looked at the gun, tried to pull his surprise into a studied calmness. He didn&#39;t like the looks of that gloved finger around that trigger. This looked like an amateur to him.\n\n&quot;I haven&#39;t collected yet.&quot;\n\n&quot;You got the money,&quot; the man stated.\n\nJake mentally curbed Muggy Wilson, the Grand promoter. Muggy always paid off in cash right after a fight. And tonight he&#39;d shoved ten crisp one-grand bills into Jake&#39;s fist. But that had been in the secrecy of Muggy&#39;s office. Jake looked at the finger again, thought he saw it tremble under the glove.\n\n&quot;Go easy.&quot; he said. &quot;Those things have been known to kill people. The dough is in my coat pocket.&quot;\n\nThe stickup had him turn to the wall, brace his hands over his head, and put his legs out wide. Jake felt the hand go into his pocket and felt the notes leave. When he had turned the man had put the gun in his coat pocket on top of the bills.\n\n&quot;The bulls&#39;ll have you in ten minutes,&quot; Jake prophesied.\n\n&quot;I figure otherwise.&quot;\n\nJake had his nerves calm now. Did he know that voice? No, the fellow talked low, as though he were disguising his voice. He had a sudden idea.\n\n&quot;If it wasn&#39;t for your gat,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;d whip the hell out of you!&quot;\n\n&quot;Come ahead,&quot; the man invited.\n\nJake went forward, fists up. Years ago he&#39;d been a leading contender for the lightweight crown. He had some of his ring-knowledge left. He showed it as he shot out a left.\n\nIt was fast, wicked, true. But the stickup&#39;s right shoulder bobbed down, and the blow slid over him. Jake glimpsed his right hand cock, come in.\n\nMost fighters hit straight. But this right hand looped, curved a little, then straightened. Jake knew then who the stickup was.\n\nHe tried to slip the punch, but the right hit on the jaw and the lights came down and hit him, too.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Friend\n\nWhen he woke up he was tied to a chair. His gag made his jaws ache. He looked at the clock and guessed he&#39;d been out around fifteen minutes. He looked at the phone, head buzzing.\n\nTen minutes later, he&#39;d jumped his chair across the room and had the receiver down. The bellboy released him.\n\n&quot;What happened?&quot;\n\n&quot;Now and then I feel mad spells coming on,&quot; Jake informed him solemnly. &quot;So I gag myself and tie myself to a chair to keep from hurting people.&quot;\n\nThe kid accepted the four-bits but not the story. Jake rolled into bed. Morning found him eating a hearty breakfast at the Greek&#39;s.\n\nHe caught the Fifth Street bus and left it at Grand, walking up Bunker Hill. The sun was bright and warm. He was in the old tenement district, the flop-house section. He climbed a set of porch steps, entered an old rooming house, and went directly to Room 21.\n\nNo answer.\n\nHe knocked again.\n\nFinally, &quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; Sleepily.\n\n&quot;A friend.&quot;\n\nA key turned. Jake went in. Pinky Malone sat on the edge of his bed, rubbing his eyes with a fighters&#39; hands. A few years back Pinky had been in the chips but he&#39;d broken his right fist on Tiny Jeffers, the Central Avenue boy.\n\n&quot;Haven&#39;t seen you for two years,&quot; Jake said. &quot;Heard you were up in &#39;Frisco?&quot;\n\n&quot;They run trains,&quot; Pinky said. He dug into his left eye again. &quot;How did you know I bunked here?&quot;\n\n&quot;An ex-fighter can&#39;t keep away from the old bunch. They told me down at the Greek&#39;s.&quot;\n\nPinky quit rubbing. &quot;You got a scrap for me, Jake?&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;ll never fight again with that mitt, kid. I came after my ten grand.&quot; Pinky looked at him. &quot;Your ten grand? Hell, I don&#39;t owe you nothing. When we busted up we were even-steven. You said that yourself.&quot;\n\n&quot;You know what—ten grand. After the Watson fight last night you was waiting for me in my hotel room. You wore gloves so you wouldn&#39;t leave any prints and you wanted to hide your hands from me. But two things gave you away.&quot;\n\n&quot;Jake, you&#39;re dreamin&#39;.&quot;\n\nJake rubbed his jaw. &quot;Well, if I was, the old mare sure throwed me. Look out the window, kid?&quot;\n\nPinky did. He came back. He kept standing there, face serious. &quot;You got bulls down there, huh?&quot;\n\nJake twisted his wrist and looked.\n\n&quot;In three minutes they come up, Pinky. Cough up the ten grand and I&#39;ll forget it.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Ten Grand\n\nPinky kept looking at him.\n\nJake looked at the cheap room.\n\nThe bed looked lumpy and the carpet didn&#39;t hide the floor in spots.\n\n&quot;I spent forty of it, &#39; Pinky said suddenly. &quot;I paid room rent and I bought a few drinks.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where is it?&quot;\n\nPinky had it under the big washbasin. He handed it to Jake who put it in his coat pocket.\n\n&quot;Damn it, Pinky,&quot; Jake said, &quot;I managed you for six years. We bunked together. You shouldn&#39;t&#39;ve done this to me.&quot;\n\n&quot;I was flat, Jake.&quot; Pinky looked at the window. &quot;Where did I slip up?&quot;\n\n&quot;Your voice, for one thing. You tried to disguise it and you did a good job—I didn&#39;t recognize it. But you slipped when you let me take a poke at you. If you hadn&#39;t done that, I&#39;d never have known it was you. Your disguisin&#39; your voice told me you were an old friend who didn&#39;t want me to recognize him. But I didn&#39;t know who you were until I saw your right coming.&quot;\n\n&quot;What&#39;s wrong with my right?&quot;\n\n&quot;You don&#39;t hit straight.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve chilled a few with that.&quot; Pinky&#39;s voice was uncordial.\n\n&quot;I can handle it.&quot;\n\nPinky&#39;s professional pride was hurt.\n\nJake found a stance &quot;Now come in, and I&#39;ll show you.&quot;\n\nPinky shuffled in, head down. Jake shot his left again; only this time, he held it. Pinky&#39;s right looped, straightened. This time Jake rode under it. His own right came up and Pinky went down.\n\nJake&#39;s knuckles throbbed.\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t know I could still hit that hard,&quot; he told the worn carpet.\n\nHe took a fin from his wallet and laid it in Pinky&#39;s hand.\n\n&quot;When you come to, Kid, drop around and I&#39;ll find a job for you.&quot;\n\nBut Pinky didn&#39;t hear that, of course.\n\nOutside, the bull asked, &quot;Everything work out okay, Jake?&quot;\n\n&quot;Everything&#39;s okay, Casey.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

For five miles it winds, deep and narrow, back into a welter of high mountains. On its southern shore, where it opens out into the broad Atlantic, lies the little village of Erradale.\n\nIn spite of the fact that one of the main roads between the North of Scotland and the South creeps round its tortuous shores, Loch Erradale had been one of the loneliest places in the country.\n\nBut when plans were passed for a great chemical factory to be built at the head of the loch, things began to change. Power was to be obtained from a reservoir to be built four miles back in the hills behind; the water from this, led through pipe-lines and tunnels, was to drive a great turbo-electric plant beside the factory.\n\nIn a very short time Loch Erradale was no longer lonely. A wharf was built, and a light railway laid from this to the site of the reservoir. Soon a contractor&#39;s camp grew up — long wooden huts for the men and galvanised iron sheds for the air compressors and the forges.\n\nDown on the loch itself small coasters arrived with materials, and lay at anchor in mid-loch for a few hours, awaiting their turn at the wharf.\n\nPast the wharf, on a dull afternoon in January, crept a long black car. Dixon Hawke was at the wheel. He and Tommy Burke, his young assistant, had been spending a fortnight climbing farther north, and while planning their return journey Hawke had decided to make a detour and call on a very old friend of his, Colonel Bilington, chief constable of the county, of Glen Erradale House.\n\nThey arrived at the house late in the afternoon, and the Colonel was delighted to meet his old friend again. Almost before they had crossed his threshold, he had invited the travellers to stay for the night.\n\nHawke had no hesitation in accepting, for there was no particular need for them to be back in London before the beginning of the week.\n\nSo that night the three of them sat down to dinner, and as the meal wore on Hawke and the Colonel drifted into reminiscence. The two men were obviously enjoying themselves enormously, and they made no attempt to hide their annoyance when a servant announced that the Colonel was required on the telephone.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Body in the Hold\n\nColonel Bilington returned to the room a few minutes later, and he was frowning.\n\n&quot;Very annoying, Hawke. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to break up the evening. There&#39;s been a man killed on one of the coasters at the head of the loch. The circumstances appear to be rather peculiar.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s a bad business,&quot; said Hawke. &quot;Look here, we&#39;ll come with you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Splendid,&quot; said the Colonel. &quot;It may interest you.&quot;\n\nThey travelled up in the Colonel&#39;s car. After a time they saw bright lights ahead of them, the arc lamps under which the coasters were unloaded at night. A few minutes later the car drew up at the side of the road.\n\nA man in seafaring clothes waiting on the wharf tipped his cap to them.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve to take you out to the Trojan,&quot; he said. &quot;She&#39;s lying at anchor in the loch.&quot;\n\nThe seaman led the way down a ladder at the side of the wharf into a rowing boat. They scrambled aboard, and with the skill of long practice he rowed them out to the coaster.\n\nA young constable met them as they climbed on deck.\n\n&quot;Evening, Robertson,&quot; said the Colonel. &quot;What&#39;s happened?&quot;\n\n&quot;There&#39;s a dead man down in the hold, sir. He&#39;s not one of the crew, and no one seems to know anything about him.&quot;&#39;\n\n&quot;H&#39;m. Where&#39;s the skipper?&quot;\n\n&quot;Here, sir,&quot; boomed a deep voice, and a great hulk of a man moved forward out of the shadows.\n\n&quot;Name?&quot; asked the Colonel.\n\n&quot;Caterick, sir.&quot;\n\n&quot;Tell us what you know.&quot;\n\nThe skipper scratched his head.\n\n&quot;Well, that&#39;s not very much, sir. We got in here yesterday afternoon. As we were unloading, my engineman reported that a cracked cylinder-head which had been giving trouble for some time would have to be replaced before we could sail. So we dropped anchor out here after unloading and sent to Glasgow for a replacement.\n\n&quot;I knew fine it would take two or three days to arrive, so I let my crew — engineman and deckhand, sir — away to a dance that was on in the evening down in the village. As for myself, I went up to see a friend of mine that&#39;s working up at the reservoir. An engineer. Name of Skene. He was off duty, so we went into the canteen at the camp.&quot;\n\nThe skipper paused and scratched his head ruefully.\n\n&quot;Ye ken what it&#39;s like when old friends meet, sir. I had a drop too much, and I couldn&#39;t rightly say how I got back here. But I woke up today about tea-time, fully dressed, in my own bunk. I have a wee box of a cabin aft there in the stern. Well, I was no&#39; feeling very like food. So I went ashore and walked down to the village. I met my crew there. They&#39;d stayed in the village overnight, and had been in no hurry to return to the ship, as they knew we wouldn&#39;t sail for a few days yet. We all came back together. My engineman, Campbell, happened to look down into the hold and saw the body.&quot;\n\nAfter the skipper had made his statement, the Colonel stepped forward and peered down into the hold. Directly below him a wooden ladder led downwards, and lying at the foot of it, was the body of a man. Near the body stood a lighted storm lantern. The Colonel stepped over the hatch-coaming and climbed down into the hold, followed by Hawke and Tommy and the constable, who carried another lantern.\n\nThe dead man was middle-aged and shabbily dressed, with tanned features which were still fixed in an expression of astonishment. He was lying on his face, and, when Colonel Bilington knelt and turned him carefully over, the lantern light showed an ugly wound on one temple.\n\nThe Colonel straightened himself.\n\n&quot;How long has this ladder been here?&quot; he asked the constable.\n\n&quot;According to Caterick, sir, it was put here to let the men out of the hold after unloading. And it&#39;s been here ever since.&quot;\n\n&quot;Seems to me,&quot; said the Colonel, &quot;that it&#39;s pretty obvious what&#39;s happened. This poor devil&#39;s been climbing down into the hold for some reason or another. He&#39;s slipped, fallen, and landed on his head.&quot;\n\n&quot;I think you&#39;re wrong,&quot; said Hawke quietly.\n\nThe Colonel glanced at him with raised eyebrows.\n\n&quot;How did you come down the ladder?&quot; Hawke asked him.\n\n&quot;The same way as everyone else,&quot; said the Colonel a little impatiently. &quot;Backwards, of course.&quot;\n\n&quot;Exactly!&quot; stripped Hawke. &quot;Yet this man has fallen on his face and was struck on the front of his head. I&#39;m afraid your explanation won&#39;t do, Colonel.&quot;\n\n&quot;You mean you think that — &quot; began the Colonel.\n\n&quot;That it looks like murder!&quot; said Hawke bluntly.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Left-Handed Murderer?\n\nThe detective bent down and began to make a methodical examination of the dead man, emptying each of his pockets in turn.\n\nAfter a while he rose to his feet with a grunt of satisfaction.\n\n&quot;Interesting,&quot; he murmured. &quot;This man was either a soldier, a sailor, a clergyman, a chauffeur, or a postman. He was murdered — probably on shore and two or three days ago — by a left-handed man.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good heavens!&quot; exclaimed the Colonel. &quot;How on earth — &quot;\n\n&quot;Very simple,&quot; said Hawke. &quot;You see his wrist-watch?&quot;\n\nThe Colonel bent forward. &quot;It&#39;s on upside down,&quot; he said sharply. &quot;The winding-knob points up the arm instead of down.&quot;\n\nHawke nodded.\n\n&quot;It was hurriedly put on by someone else. In fact, this man was actually dressed in these clothes after he had been killed. If you look at his fingernails you&#39;ll see that those on his right hand are not so well kept as those on his left. He used the right hand more than the left. He was right-handed. Yet all the important things that came out of his pockets — handkerchief, cigarette-lighter, loose change — came out of the pockets on his left side. Taking that into consideration with the watch, I think it&#39;s reasonable to assume that he was dressed after he was killed. And dressed by a man who was left-handed.&quot;\n\n&quot;Quite, quite,&quot; said the Colonel quickly. &quot;But why change his clothes at all, Hawke?&quot;\n\n&quot;Obviously because he was wearing some distinctive uniform — something by which he would be more easily traced. There aren&#39;t so many postmen, chauffeurs, fishermen, or clergymen as there are men in shabby, nondescript suits.&quot;\n\nThe Colonel laughed unsteadily.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re a little too quick for me, Hawke. Although it does seem quite obvious now that you&#39;ve pointed it out.&quot;\n\nHawke looked grim.\n\n&quot;Well, having proved to you that it&#39;s a case of murder,&quot; he said, &quot;I hope to be able to prove to you in a day or two that it isn&#39;t — with the help of that little mark on the outside of the knuckle of the index linger of the dead man&#39;s right hand.&quot;\n\nThe Colonel bent forward and noticed for the first time a small, red weal where Hawke indicated.\n\n&quot;Can&#39;t make head or tail of that,&quot; said the Colonel.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s rather interesting, all the same,&quot; said Hawke thoughtfully. &quot;There are one or two lines of inquiry which I should like to try out tomorrow,&quot; he added. &quot;With your permission, of course.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;d be very glad if you would,&quot; said the Colonel, with obvious relief. &quot;In the meantime, I&#39;ll get Inspector Ramsey up from the county headquarters. He&#39;ll carry on with the routine inquiries during the night.&quot;\n\nShortly afterwards they went ashore and drove back to Glen Erradale House. Hawke rose early the following morning, and found Tommy already at breakfast. A few moments later the Colonel appeared with a sheaf of papers in his hand.\n\n&quot;Morning, Hawke,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ve a disappointing report here from Ramsey. He&#39;s followed up every thread in the case, and they all lead to a dead end. No one seems to know anything about the dead man. There was no brawling of any kind up at the camp. Caterick&#39;s story has been confirmed, and the two members of the crew spent the night down at Erradale all right.&quot;\n\n&quot;How did Caterick get back to his ship the night before last?&quot; Hawke asked.\n\nColonel Bilington glanced through his papers. &quot;Ramsey doesn&#39;t say,&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;That seems to me to be the key to the whole business,&quot; Hawke said. &quot;I think when we discover that, we&#39;ll discover how the body was taken on board. Tommy and I will go up to the camp now to see if we can trace Caterick&#39;s movements after he set out on his return to the ship.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nSkene&#39;s Bet\n\nHawke and Tommy drove up as far as the wharf, where they left the car and continued the journey on foot. A rough and newly-made road wound up the glen close to the light railway that carried supplies up to the camp from the loch.\n\nA little apart from the workings was a cluster of low wooden houses; one, a little larger than the others, stood in the centre.\n\n&quot;I think that&#39;s the place we&#39;re looking for,&quot; said Hawke. &quot;Come along, my lad.&quot;\n\nHawke strode eagerly down the road, and ten minutes brought them to the camp. As Hawke had surmised, the large wooden building was the canteen.\n\nA fat man in a once-white overall was standing behind a counter at the far end. Hawke crossed over and gave him good-morning.\n\n&quot;Know anything about a man called Caterick?&quot; he asked.\n\nThe cook thought for a minute or two, and then shook his head.\n\n&quot;Can&#39;t say that I do, sir. There&#39;s fifteen hundred men in the camp, and you can&#39;t know them all by name.&quot;\n\n&quot;He&#39;s a friend of Mr. Skene,&quot; said Hawke.\n\nA light of comprehension dawned in the fat man&#39;s eyes.\n\n&quot;I know who you mean. A seafaring man? He was in here the night before last, and Skene was pumping him full of liquor most of the evening. They had a bet on or something to see which of them could hold the most.&quot;\n\n&quot;Any idea how this man Caterick got back to his ship?&quot;\n\n&quot;As a matter of fact, I can tell you that, sir. He lost the bet, and Skene got me to help him out into the fresh air. As I was leaving them to come inside again, I heard Skene saying, &#39; Don&#39;t worry, old chap. I&#39;ll take you down in my car.&#39; And that&#39;s the last I saw of him.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where does Skene stay? In the camp here?&quot;\n\n&quot;No. The engineers don&#39;t need to. And he&#39;s a married man with a couple of kids. He lives in a bungalow on the other side of the hill there. Wait and I&#39;ll show you.&quot;\n\nHe came out from behind the counter and walked over to the door of the canteen. From there he pointed out a road that came down the glen.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s an old road that goes down to Erradale village. Skene&#39;s place is a mile up the road.&quot;\n\nHawke thanked him, and they set off for the engineer&#39;s house.\n\n&quot;This chap Skene may not be in just now, guv&#39;nor,&quot; Tommy said.\n\n&quot;So much the better,&quot; said Hawke.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve an idea that his wife&#39;s the person we want to see first.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA Family Secret\n\nTwenty minutes walking brought them to the bungalow. It was a converted shepherd&#39;s cottage, commanding a fine vista of moorland.\n\nThe door was opened to them by a young woman. She was tall and dark, and her clear eyes and skin spoke of youth and health.\n\n&quot;Mrs. Skene?&quot; the detective asked.\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot; She had a pleasant, deep voice.\n\n&quot;May I speak to you for a moment?&quot;\n\n&quot;Surely. Please come in.&quot;\n\nMrs. Skene showed them into a bright little sitting-room. Hawke and Tommy took the seats that she indicated, and she waited curiously.\n\n&quot;Your husband, I believe,&quot; began Hawke, &quot;knows a man called Caterick.&quot;\n\nShe nodded.\n\n&quot;Archie Caterick. He&#39;s the skipper of one of the coasters carrying materials here.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right. A man was found dead on his boat last night, Mrs. Skene, and I&#39;d like to ask you a few questions about Caterick. There&#39;s nothing against him, so you needn&#39;t be afraid of talking. My name is Hawke — Dixon Hawke.&quot;\n\nMrs. Skene gave one or two disjointed facts — how Caterick and her husband had met somewhere in South America, and how the friendship had developed.\n\n&quot;Were you in South America with your husband?&quot; Hawke asked.\n\n&quot;No. I first met him shortly after his return. As a matter of fact, he knew my brother out there — was rather kind to him — and came home with a letter of introduction from my brother to me.&quot;\n\n&quot;Is your brother still out there?&quot; asked Hawke.\n\nA shadow seemed to cross her face. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she said slowly.\n\nHawke rose to his feet.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s all right, Mrs. Skene,&quot; he said gently. &quot;We all have things that we don&#39;t like to talk about, don&#39;t we?&quot;\n\nMrs. Skene looked up at him and smiled.\n\n&quot;He turned out rather a waster,&quot; she said frankly. &quot;He went out as a missionary. But he had a terrible weakness — gambling. He went from bad to worse. My husband helped him for a time. But for a couple of years now we haven&#39;t heard anything from him, in fact.&quot;\n\n&quot;Was he — in Holy Orders?&quot; Hawke asked.\n\nShe nodded, and said very softly: &quot;He was unfrocked.&quot;\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll not distress you any further, Mrs. Skene,&quot; Hawke said, after a moment&#39;s silence. &quot;You have helped me considerably.&quot;\n\nOutside in the hall, as though to relieve the emotional strain, Hawke asked: &quot;You play golf, Mrs. Skene?&quot; She shook her head.\n\n&quot;No. My husband does, though. He goes down to the county town. There&#39;s quite a pleasant little course there. He was playing quite recently — not yesterday but the day before.&quot;\n\nHawke&#39;s eyes were on a bag of clubs in the hallstand.\n\n&quot;Not a very pleasant day for golf, Mrs. Skene. If I remember rightly, it was quite stormy.&quot;\n\nShe laughed. &quot;Oh, I expect he spent most of the time in the clubhouse. You know what men are!&quot;\n\n&quot;I have a fair idea,&quot; said Hawke, and they all laughed together as they said good-bye.\n\nOnce outside, Hawke&#39;s manner changed abruptly.\n\n&quot;Tommy,&quot; he said crisply, &quot;go back and get the car. Find Skene&#39;s golf course, and find out from the starter if Skene was playing there the day before yesterday. I&#39;m going to take a short cut down to Glen Erradale House. I&#39;ve an urgent telephone call to put through.&quot;\n\n&quot;Right, guv&#39;nor!&quot; said Tommy, and he turned and went back up the road.\n\nHawke cut across the moors, and half an hour brought him to the back of Colonel Bilington&#39;s house. The Colonel was in the study, and he was looking worried.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m glad to see you back, Hawke,&quot; he said. &quot;This case has got me rattled. Ramsey&#39;s absolutely at a dead end. No hint of the dead man&#39;s identity, no motive, no weapon, none of the things that usually give us a start in these cases — &quot;\n\n&quot;May I use your telephone?&quot; said Hawke curtly.\n\nThe Colonel waved him to the instrument, and five minutes later Hawke was talking to an old friend of his at Scotland Yard. He was brief and to the point.\n\n&quot;I want to know everything you can find out about one, John Skene, engineer, during the time he was in South America two years ago. I&#39;m particularly interested in anything that might lead to blackmail. And I want to know by five this evening at the latest. You can manage that? Yes, you can phone it through. I&#39;m with Colonel Bilington, Glen Erradale House.&quot;\n\nHe hung up the receiver, and as he turned from it the Colonel opened his mouth as if to speak. Hawke held up his hand.\n\n&quot;Not till five o&#39;clock,&quot; said the detective with a smile.\n\nThe Colonel grinned. &quot;Hawke,&quot; he said, &quot;there are times when I positively dislike you!&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nBlackmail!\n\nTommy returned late in the afternoon with the information that Skene had not been seen at his golf course for a fortnight. He had just made his report when the telephone rang. Hawke reached forward and picked up the receiver.\n\n&quot;Yes, Hawke speaking. You have? Yes.&quot; There was a long pause. &quot;Thank you,&quot; said Hawke at length. &quot;That&#39;s all I wanted to know.&quot;\n\nHe hung up the receiver, and turned back to the others.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s that,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;I can name your murderer, and I can name his victim.&quot;\n\nHe sat down and began to fill a pipe, and as he did so he told Colonel Bilington of their interview with Mrs. Skene.\n\n&quot;And this is your case,&quot; he said, when he had done so. &quot;It was the changing of the clothes that started me off. I knew from that fact that the murdered man wore a distinguishing uniform. And when I heard that Mrs. Skene&#39;s brother had once been in Holy Orders I began to wonder. Now, Skene is left handed. You noticed his golf clubs, Tommy? And Skene and Mrs. Skene&#39;s brother were in South America together. The thing&#39;s beginning to take shape, you see.&quot;\n\nHawke pondered for a moment.\n\n&quot;Could it be possible, I wondered, if this brother — who was a bit of a waster — could have come home, knowing something to Skene&#39;s detriment, and tried to blackmail him? It would have to be something serious; something that would cost Skene his job or smash his happy married life. I had the answer over the telephone just now. Mrs. Skene&#39;s brother married Skene to a half-caste woman in a mining camp in the backwoods of South America four years ago. This woman ran off with another man shortly afterwards, and the story got into the papers there at the time. I don&#39;t suppose Skene has seen her since.\n\n&quot;The rest is surmise, but it&#39;s fairly obvious what happened. The brother returned and tried to blackmail Skene, threatening to break up his home. Skene killed him and hid the body temporarily. He couldn&#39;t afford to have it found in the neighbourhood in case, by some mischance, his wife should recognise it. So he hit on the idea of dumping it on board Caterick&#39;s ship.\n\n&quot;If it hadn&#39;t been for the cracked cylinder-head that delayed her sailing, the body probably wouldn&#39;t have been discovered until the boat reached Glasgow. There would be no chance of it being recognised by Mrs. Skene there. And as an extra precaution Skene changed the clerical clothes — it&#39;s quite reasonable that the brother should wear them, even though he had no longer any right to them — for a nondescript suit which he bought second hand in the county town the day before yesterday, when he was supposed to be playing golf.\n\n&quot;It was a very foolish thing to do, and it&#39;s what gave him away. Anyhow, he made Caterick so drunk that the poor fellow had to be motored down to his boat. And all the way back to the boat Caterick travelled with a corpse, though he was too drunk to know it.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nThe Old-Fashioned Revolver\n\nWe&#39;ll go up and pull in this man Skene at once,&quot; said Colonel Bilington. &quot;Hawke, you&#39;ve made a marvellous job of this.&quot; They drove in the Colonel&#39;s car again. At the wharf they picked up Inspector Ramsey, and during the remainder of the run the Colonel told his subordinate details of the case.\n\nInquiry at the power scheme revealed that Skene was at work in the tunnel. An overseer offered to guide them.\n\nThe tunnel was damp and filled with a thin mist that soon had their coats drenched. Most of the time they were splashing through six inches of water or trying to find a footing on the sleepers of the railway track.\n\nAt length they came to a gang of men at work with pneumatic hammers. The noise in the confined space was frightful.\n\nRamsey signalled to the men to stop their machines, and in the heavy silence that followed Colonel Bilington\n\n&quot;Where is Mr. Skene?&quot;\n\nA tall, brown-faced man in an oilskin and rubber thigh boots stepped forward.\n\n&quot;My name is Skene,&quot; he said quietly.\n\n&quot;A man has been found dead on board the coaster Trojan,&quot; said the Colonel. &quot;Can you give us any information in connection with his death?&quot; As Skene was about to speak, Inspector Ramsey formally cautioned him.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s all right,&quot; said Skene. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you the whole story. But supposing you come to my shack? It&#39;ll be more comfortable for you.&quot;\n\nThey went back down the tunnel, and in a little wooden hut near the entrance Skene told the story that Hawke had deduced from little more than an inverted wrist-watch. But there was one important difference.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;ll believe me,&quot; he said. &quot;But it happens to be true. I did it in self-defence. Tom Allan, my brother-in-law — though I don&#39;t suppose I&#39;ve any right to call him that — came back to this country with the intention of making a considerable amount of money out of me. I&#39;ve private means as well, you see. I refused point-blank. Told him to do his damnedest. He was furious. He knew as well as I did that my — my wife would stick by me. He took out a revolver and started to threaten me. I closed with him. It went off. I tore it from his hand and struck him. You won&#39;t believe me, I know, but — &quot;\n\n&quot;But it&#39;s true, all the same,&quot; said Hawke quietly. &quot;It was an old-fashioned revolver. A good deal of the gas generated by the explosion escaped out of the side of the chamber, and left a small burn on the knuckle of Allan&#39;s right hand. That does happen with the older type of revolver.&quot;\n\nHawke laughed softly, and glanced at Colonel Bilington.\n\n&quot;I told you I&#39;d prove that it wasn&#39;t murder,&quot; he said.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

He could feel them distinctly. For a while he had not even been able to feel. There had been only a great instant of utter fright and alarm as something black, short, and straight descended toward his eyes until it seemed like a plummet of doom growing frightfully in size. The plummet had blotted out everything. Consciousness was extinguished.\n\nBut there had been light. Flashes, like fitful bursts of lightning seen through murky fog. Flashes outlined against crushing masses of rock, thick, impenetrable, massive. Perhaps the mountains that closed him in were made of rock. Only rock could be that heavy.\n\nA thin gleam of light split the blackness. Only this time it was not a visiting gleam. The light stayed. No matter how he strained his eyeballs behind their lids the light remained constant, steady, unwavering. Eternal as the weight on his head.\n\nCould he move? A part of him was in motion. He was not dead. His heart was beating. Experimentally he tried to wriggle his toes. They crisped up and down, cramped by the shoes he wore. But they had moved.\n\nHis body? It was not easy. The mountains imprisoning his head seemed to have rooted themselves about his middle. Where were his arms? He could not feel them. Had they been cut off, removed as the climax of some surgical operation?\n\nA wave of hideous fear swept him, as the implication of the phrase &quot;surgical operation&quot; burst on his brain like a bombshell. Trembling he tried to sit up.\n\nHis head and shoulders came up in a swift, forward motion as, caught in the grip of panic, he suddenly exerted every muscle, every nerve. The split second of action seemed a hundred years.\n\nThe mountains, weight and all, vanished as his arms and hands which had been covering his eyes fell with a thud to the floor. His eyes came open.\n\nHe rose to his feet in a small, brightly lit room, took a step forward, stumbled, fell full length. In an instant he was again on his feet, violently shaking the man over whose prone body he had fallen.\n\nThe other came awake slowly, eyes opening with a sort of puzzled horror, then rapidly taking in his surroundings.\n\n&quot;Where are we?&quot; The first man poked a finger at the walls.\n\n&quot;Blessed if I know, Martin.&quot; The other rose to his feet, brushed himself, took a quick look at the room.\n\n&quot;Whoever it was got us in the car must have hidden in the back seat.&quot; Martin rubbed the back of his head. &quot;The last thing I can remember is turning into Market Street. Then …\n\n&quot;Yeah, I got it too.&quot; His companion was rubbing his head.\n\n&quot;Bryant!&quot; Martin grasped his right arm violently. &quot;The conference! It&#39;s tomorrow! We&#39;ve got to sign the contract. Or&quot;—he paused—&quot;maybe today is &#39;tomorrow&#39;.&quot; He looked at his wrist watch. It was still running. Ten minutes past two. They&#39;d started out from their office at noon. How long …\n\nBryant looked at his own watch. He shook his head. &quot;No telling how long. Might be twelve hours, either way.&quot; Martin took a step toward him. &quot;But we&#39;ve got to—&quot;\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll get out,&quot; the other asserted grimly. &quot;Let&#39;s look around.&quot;\n\nThere wasn&#39;t much to look at. The room was small, possibly ten feet wide by fifteen long, windowless. Its ceiling was low, no more than eight feet from the floor. The only break in the concrete walls was a metal door at one end of the room&#39;s length. One look at the door convinced both men of the futility of trying to break through it without tools. Solid, of the regulation firedoor type, its fastenings were on the other side. There was no handle or knob visible.\n\nThe light in the ceiling burned on. They were grateful for it. Without it, both knew they might have gone mad.\n\nTime passed slowly, heavily. Hunger began to grow on them. A panic took hold of Bryant. At first cool, almost assured, he began to fidget, stir, mutter to himself.\n\nOnly his voice broke the silence. There was no other noise. As time passed, something else in the room started to oppress Martin. He did not know what it was or even imagine what it could be. He only knew that at length his mouth was parched, his stomach screaming for food, and his body trembling from head to foot.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Concrete Storeroom\n\nAs the hands on both their watches touched five o&#39;clock, the lights went out. There was an instant of complete silence, while neither of them breathed. Then a slit of light appeared in the far wall as the door began to swing back. Just a slit which vanished as the light behind it went out.\n\nMartin tensed himself for a spring, strained through the darkness for the vanished gleam. He leaped forward, collided with a heavy body, flung his arms outward in wild slashes. Behind him came Bryant, fighting desperately forward.\n\nThe pair pressed ahead for a moment or two, while great, muscled arms tried to restrain them. With a grunting heave they were flung back, while the beam of a flashlight flared momentarily. Martin heard a ponderous step advancing toward him, shrunk back against the nearest wall, side by side with his companion.\n\nAgain the black rod of doom loomed from behind the light, came up at him like a thundercloud, swerved and smashed into the back of his head.\n\nRough hands woke him next. He wearily opened the eyes in his aching head to find the room again ablaze with light. The figure that had been shaking him rose, stepped back, leveled a gun. Martin glanced at it through bleared eyes. It was nothing extraordinary. Just a man in a blue serge business suit—masked and armed. Painfully, Martin got to his feet, stood swaying. The only thing he could think to do was to look at his watch.\n\nIts hands showed six o&#39;clock.\n\n&quot;Do you know where you are?&quot; The words came thickly through the mask, tones muffled by layers of cloth. As it spoke the figure with the gun moved backward slightly, toward the firedoor.\n\nMartin fell against the wall, remained there breathing with difficulty. He looked up, grimaced.\n\n&quot;Maybe you&#39;d like to tell me,&quot; he grated.\n\nThe figure chuckled. The muzzle of the gun moved into line with Martin&#39;s middle.\n\n&quot;Why not? No harm in telling you now. Too late for you to do anything about it.&quot; The figure paused. &quot;You&#39;re twenty stories above ground, in a concrete storeroom. In precisely what building is none of your business. The walls of this room are two feet thick. Beyond it are others—and other men. Escape is impossible. No one can hear you. There is no one who knows you are here.&quot;\n\nMartin cocked his head. That strange impression again, in the absolute silence. Was it sound, smell—or what? He couldn&#39;t think.\n\n&quot;What are you going to do with me?&quot; he asked slowly.\n\n&quot;For the present, nothing. You&#39;ll be fed, of course. Later—another blow on the head, possibly fatal this time …&quot;\n\nMartin leaped. Every ounce of power in his not-inconsiderable body was behind it. He was weak, nauseous, but in that leap was the strength of desperation.\n\nThe gun fired, once, twice. Both bullets went wild. A third hit the light bulb. Then Martin&#39;s fists were smashing against the figure&#39;s chin. An instant later he had flung open the door, closed and locked it behind him, whirled to the left and dashed down a long passageway. At its end was an ordinary door. Trembling he laid his hand on the knob, pulled it toward him.\n\nThe soft glow of evening fell past the flight of steps that led from the basement in which he had been imprisoned and bathed his upturned face. Then swiftly and rubbing his head, Martin walked up the steps, emerged onto a well-known and busy street corner in a residential neighborhood and hailed a taxi. Noting the time by a clock in a store window he was hurried downtown to make an appointment he had almost missed.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nYou Can Hear It Ticking\n\nThat evening at his and Bryant&#39;s club, Martin surveyed the circle of men who sat about the large table in one of the establishment&#39;s famous private chambers.\n\nThey were his partners now, he reflected, for better or worse, in a giant enterprise created just in time to save him from utter ruin. All partners. Jackson, the city&#39;s greatest banker; Hopkins, wealthy industrialist; Bryant, his own business partner who had separately managed to escape from an adjoining cell shortly after Martin trapped their captor in the original cell; Goldwater eminent research chemist; Schroeder, affluent philanthropist; and Fownes, least known of the group, mysterious, supplied with money no one knew from where.\n\nMartin lit a cigarette, flecked an ash from his lapel. For some moments now the assembled company had been waiting for him to speak. They were expectant, wondering why this additional meeting had been called after the conference earlier in the evening.\n\nSchroeder poured himself a glass of water from the carafe on the table, turned quizzical eyes on Martin. &quot;Well?&quot; he demanded, abruptly.\n\n&quot;Someone in this room is a criminal, a kidnaper.&quot; Martin&#39;s eyes shifted purposely about the circle of faces. &quot;Bryant and I were removed to keep us from signing that contract. It has to be one of us, for only in this group could exist the necessary motives.&quot;\n\nGoldwater giggled nervously, then fell silent, chewing the ends of his mustache.\n\nThe others looked at Martin with apprehension. A tension began rising in the room, charged and supercharged with fear. And Martin talked:\n\n&quot;It&#39;s very simple, really. Bryant and I were slugged from the back seat of my car. We woke up in the place we told you about. It was a very silent place. The man who kidnaped us told me that the room was twenty stories above the ground. That was merely a lie. The walls were damp, not wet, but damp enough to have to be located underground. Although nothing could be heard, the vibration of passing trucks shook the walls. Not noticeably, not obviously. That&#39;s why I knew that beyond the firedoor lay a street and people, not more concrete and then empty air.\n\n&quot;And your kidnaper?&quot; Fownes&#39; voice was pointed. His flat, spatulate finger coiled and uncoiled. The atmosphere thickened.\n\n&quot;He had a motive—a good one. Delaying the conference for many days by keeping me a prisoner, making it necessary at last to go on without my signature would have ruined me, without ruining him. A lot of money was involved. Millions, as you all know.\n\n&quot;There is, of course, only one such man. He was in that room with me and he hadn&#39;t been there more than two minutes before I knew who he was, knew because something about him identified him immediately. His confederate had brought me there. It was he who opened the door after Bryant and I first awakened.&quot;\n\nSchroeder thoughtfully knocked ashes from his cigar. &quot;You knew your kidnaper?&quot;\n\nMartin smiled grimly. &quot;Let&#39;s say rather that I knew the man who paid him to do his work—the second man in the room, the man with the mask. He was the real criminal. Dressed in a nondescript suit, muffled, absolutely disguised beyond recognition, except for one thing, his watch.&quot;\n\nAcross the table nonchalant hands poured a glass of water, dropped a pellet within the glass, unobserved.\n\nMartin&#39;s voice went on, inexorably: &quot;The room was silent. But there were sounds. My breathing. His. The tick of that watch sounded loudest of all. And I knew what it was when I&#39;d heard it the second time—a big, old-fashioned dollar watch, the kind one of us uses from eccentricity.\n\n&quot;A watch worn in the vest pocket of a man who had been with me in that room once before. A man who was an hour and a half late for the conference, because I locked him in the concrete room. He couldn&#39;t get out until his hireling had come and enabled him to change back to the clothes he wore when he&#39;d stretched himself out beside me feigning unconsciousness. He&#39;d had a gun too, a .38.&quot;\n\nMartin plucked a lead slug from a vest pocket and threw it down on the table.\n\n&quot;His third shot, the one that shattered the light bulb fell into my coat pocket after it had hit the ceiling. You all know who uses the watch I&#39;ve described, but only I know who owns a .38 pistol on a permit. It should be fairly easy to check the markings on the slug if he&#39;ll surrender the gun—now. As for the watch, you can hear it ticking right now, even in this room, if you listen hard enough.&quot;\n\nBryant&#39;s head fell forward. His eyes, bulging with the poison he&#39;d drunk, stared hideously in the glare of death. Then the body slipped sidewise and dropped like a sack of wet flour. As it hit the floor a shiny object spun from a vest pocket and shattered.\n\nA dollar watch.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

This incident gave the initial impetus to a most terrible catastrophe. That so small a matter could lead to such appalling results was due entirely to the character and temperament of Ralph Kremp.\n\nThat young man was of the hyperneurotic, tempestuous type. That is, he was easily excitable and given to acting on impulse rather than on reason. Little provocation was needed to drive him into a rage. His temper once aroused, soon got beyond his control and frequently led him into deeds of passion and even violence. His anger at times was sustained through protracted periods, a feature which sometimes induced those with whom he came in contact on such occasions to doubt his sanity.\n\nThe affair in the restaurant was characteristic. Kremp made a caustic remark concerning the waiter&#39;s attentiveness. The waiter who was an extra, and indifferent to the prospect of losing his job, commented slurringly on the fastidiousness of diners who &quot;couldn&#39;t tell a sirloin steak from an oyster fry anyway.&quot;\n\nA less combative person would probably have reported the waiter to the management. Ralph Kremp began a spirited denunciation and in his excitement he rose from his chair. The waiter a bit frightened, put out a hand as in a calming gesture. His movement was a trifle too hurried and forceful. He had the ill fortune to touch Kremp on the chest while he was slightly off balance.\n\nThe light push was sufficient to upset Kremp altogether and to topple him back into his chair. It was a ludicrous fall and caused several other diners to laugh.\n\nThat was the spark which ignited the consuming flame of Kremp&#39;s fury. He seized a heavy water tumbler and hurled it at the waiter. The aim was a trifle high. The glass tore a piece from the waiter&#39;s scalp. A few women screamed, several men jumped up and other waiters came running from different directions.\n\nKremp threw himself in a low tackle at the object of his wrath. They hit the floor together and rolled around. Fists, elbows, knees and feet were used as weapons. A table was overturned. The struggle continued beneath the debris.\n\nThe waiter eventually fought himself free. He staggered to his feet and retreated. Kremp attempted to renew the assault but was set upon by several diners and restaurant employees. With a madman&#39;s strength he tried to fight them off. Before he was finally subdued, two waiters and three diners bore unmistakable marks of severe maltreatment. In the confusion someone had telephoned to the police. Kremp and the waiter were placed under arrest.\n\nAt the police station Kremp affected great indignation and was insulting in his manner and language to the lieutenant. He claimed to be connected with one of the best families in the city. He demanded the privilege of calling up Mr. Walter Boyer on the phone. Walter Boyer, he bragged, was his cousin and he had pull enough to break any man on the force. None of the officers appeared to worry any over the threat of being broken. Nevertheless the mention of Boyer&#39;s name did create something of a stir. The Boyers were shipbuilders, multi-millionaires and for several generations prominent in the social and political life of the city.\n\nOwing to Kremp&#39;s extreme nervousness and agitation, he could not control his voice. He was finally compelled to request the lieutenant to speak for him.\n\nThe lieutenant spoke for some five minutes and then listened for some twenty seconds. Then turning to Kremp, he said:\n\n&quot;Mr. Boyer asked me to tell you that he thinks you are a lunatic and that he has tired of helping you out of your foolish scrapes.&quot;\n\nKremp was found guilty of disorderly conduct and sentenced to six months. Thus his exaggerated ego was humiliated beyond forgetting or forgiving. He suffered all the persecutory delusions of a madman. He imagined the Boyer family to be the central moving figure in the conspiracy against him. Every day he hated the Boyers more till at length he could think of nothing but revenge.\n\nAnd in his anger and hate he accomplished that which in his saner moments had been beyond him. His entire character seemed to change. Formerly irritable and irascible, he now became patient and forbearing. This change was his first step in his yet indefinite plan for vengeance.\n\nKremp&#39;s mother had been the sister of the older Boyer. After she died, Boyer&#39;s sons and Kremp were the only blood relatives.\n\nOld Mr. Boyer accepted Kremp&#39;s postures of repentance as being sincere. After Kremp had behaved himself for three months after his release, Boyer offered him a clerical position. When Kremp made good at the work, the old gentleman again invited his nephew to his home. It was then that Kremp&#39;s criminal plans began to assume a definite outline.\n\nHe plotted with a madman&#39;s cunning and patience. Scheme after scheme was discarded because it was not safe enough or not cruel enough. And several ideas were dismissed because they were not inclusive. It would have given him no satisfaction to hurt one of the boys. His feud was with the family.\n\nIt came to him at last—what he considered an inspiration. He realized that a set of circumstances could be utilized in a crime of a sweeping, all-destructive nature. With one stroke he could annihilate the entire Boyer family. Besides being emotionally gratifying, it would also be a profitable venture. If the Boyer family were destroyed, he, as the only blood relative, would inherit the family fortune of over twenty million.\n\nThis is the scene which had become impressed on Kremp&#39;s mind: The elder Boyer was an old-fashioned gentleman and had retained many of the customs and habits of his parents. Among his idiosyncrasies was the one of using candle lights. In the music room four silver candlesticks ornamented the mantelpiece. Red candles, about an inch in diameter, were used.\n\nAfter dinner the Boyers generally spent half an hour in the music room. The electric lights were extinguished and the elder Mr. Boyer lighted the four candles. This act was something in the nature of a ceremony. A soft light was thrown on the room and a quiet, domestic atmosphere was created.\n\nHow Kremp intended to use this setting for his crime will be clear from the rehearsal of his actions.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nDamn Tricky Stuff\n\nMr. Lewis Brophy was a highly respected man—in some circles. He was a man of many and variegated accomplishments all of which were conducive to inconvenience or ill health, and sometimes even worse, to those on whom Mr. Brophy practiced. Mr. Brophy seldom sought acquaintances outside of his own set. Sometimes, however, he was sought. He could supply necessities of a certain kind and he was not particular whom he served so long as he was paid well for it.\n\nA pickpocket whom he had met in jail had introduced Kremp to Brophy, On his third visit to the room of the thug the latter passed over a small glass bottle filled with yellowish liquid. Kremp was highly interested in the contents of the bottle and listened attentively to Mr. Brophy&#39;s recital of the peculiar properties and characteristics of the contents.\n\n&quot;I boiled it down from dynamite,&quot; explained Mr. Brophy. &quot;And now you better be careful how you handle it. Nitroglycerine is a damn tricky stuff. And don&#39;t get the fool idea that it always explodes on concussion. That&#39;s what a lot of storywriters think—that any jar is bound to set the stuff off. It might explode on concussion—and it might not. Now for instance, suppose you put a couple of drops on a stone and hit it a straight downward blow with a hammer. The chances are— mind you I say chances—that only that part which you hit will explode. But it you sock it a glancing blow the whole thing will go up. Then again, to judge by what happened to some of my friends, the stuff can be exploded by just looking at it kinda hard. It seems to have whims. Sometimes it will stand for a lot of monkeying and sometimes it&#39;ll get all het up and blow you into a psychic plasma without no reason at all. Sudden heat will explode it; that&#39;s one thing you can be pretty sure of.&quot;\n\nA few hours later Mr. Brophy was remarking to one of his friends:\n\n&quot;That guy Kremp sure gimme the creeps. Stewed mackerel, but he was nervous! I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he loses his head entirely and drinks the stuff. I got a feeling he&#39;s going to be an angel soon.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Action of Lighting A Candle\n\nThe Action of Lighting A Candle\n\nTwo nights later Kremp dined with the Boyers. He purposely arrived a little early. While waiting for the Boyers to come down, he sauntered into the music room, switched on the electric light and played a popular tune on the piano. Thereupon he rose and stepped noiselessly to the door which opened on the hall. He could hear the Boyers moving about on the floor above. From the dining room to the rear came the sounds of the servants who were setting the table. He went quickly to the mantelpiece and drew a glass bottle from a coat pocket.\n\nCandles generally burn to a saucer like hollow at the top. This is because the tallow near the wick becomes hotter and consequently melts more rapidly than that around the edge. Into the cavity of each of the four candles Kremp poured about a spoonful of nitroglycerine. Then he turned off the electric light and went back into the library.\n\nAfter dinner old Mr. Boyer invited him to the music room to listen to a few new records. Kremp pleaded a previous engagement—he had tickets for the theatre—and regretted that he had to leave at once. He was already a trifle late. He took his leave in a perfectly calm and natural manner.\n\nBut he had no sooner reached the street when the excitement which he had suppressed so long got the better of him and he began walking hurriedly with no attention to his direction. He kept going till the geography of the city impeded his further progress in a straight line. That is he reached the East River. Then he became conscious of his surroundings.\n\nHe retraced his steps a few blocks. Then he hailed a passing taxi and had himself driven to the theatre. During the performance his excitement subsided somewhat and he began reflecting on the results of his plan.\n\nThere was always a chance, of course, that the Boyers might change their minds and not go into the music room that night. That, however, did not affect his scheme. They would go some night and Mr. Boyer would light the candles. That is, he would light only one of them. There was no reason to believe that he would notice the liquid. The action of lighting a candle is a casual one and requires no concentration. In all probability the old man would be talking to one of his sons while engaged in the process.\n\nNitroglycerine, Mr. Brophy had told him, is almost certain to explode when sudden heat is applied to it. There were four candles, four chances. He did not see how his scheme could fail.\n\nHe expected that in the morning he would be notified that an unfortunate accident had occurred in the Boyer home.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nElbow Grease\n\nThe Boyers had not intended going into the music room that evening; they had offered to entertain Kremp as a social courtesy. After Kremp had gone the old man went to the library to read. The boys went up into their own rooms. Later all three of them went to a directors&#39; meeting. None of the household went into the music room that night.\n\nAt about ten o&#39;clock next morning—Boyer&#39;s sons had already gone to business—Mrs. Nolan began her housecleaning duties. Mrs. Nolan, it must be said, was an energetic lady. Her favorite polish was Elbow Grease: when she worked she raised a dust and a sweat. The windows of the room in which Mrs. Nolan was carrying on were always thrown wide open. And Mrs. Nolan was fastidious; she cleaned under as well as around the furniture.\n\nOutdoors, the temperature that morning was below freezing. Mrs. Nolan generated considerable heat when she worked. As long as she was busy she was more or less indifferent to temperature. Now Mr. Brophy in his elucidation of the properties of nitroglycerine, had failed to inform Kremp of one peculiarity. Nitroglycerine freezes at 34.04° F. and when it freezes it changes to long whitish crystals.\n\nMrs. Nolan kept the windows in the music room open for almost an hour so the nitroglycerine which Kremp had spilled into the hollows at the top of the candles, froze. And Mrs. Nolan, making her final inspection of the room, noticed the whitish crystals at the tops of the four candles.\n\nWith reference to what happened next, we call to your attention the following proverbs: &#39;&#39;Where ignorance is bliss, &#39;tis folly to be wise.&quot; &quot;Death may meet us everywhere.&quot; And, &quot;Innocence is no protection.&quot; The first two of these wise cracks we admit. The last we intend to prove in the easiest way—by citing the exception.\n\nThe whitish crystals, each one of them potentially able to transform Mrs. Nolan into a sudden if rather clumsy angel, aroused that lady&#39;s curiosity. She picked up one of the candles and poked at the top of it with a hairpin, but the crystals clung rather tenaciously to the tallow, so she finally used her fingernails. Scratch, scratch, scrape!\n\nWhat was it they used to say at the old motordrome down at Coney Island? Oh yes,—&quot;Come in and see the motor cyclists race neck and neck with death!&quot; These fellows had nothing on Mrs. Nolan when it came to taking chances As Mrs. Nolan dug the crystals off the third candle, a small piece broke off one of them and fell to the floor. And as she stepped to pick up the fourth candle she placed most of her two hundred and twenty pounds on the frozen nitroglycerine. My! That crystal could have played a nasty trick on her!\n\nShe found it a moment later, crushed to powder on the carpet, swept it up and spilled it with the rest of the crystals into a brass ashtray … . Well anyhow, in that respect, Mr. Brophy was right: concussion will explode it sometimes, sometimes it won&#39;t. This time it didn&#39;t.\n\nWe also know a proverb to cover the succeeding events: &quot;With God, nothing is accidental.&quot;\n\nMrs. Nolan decided to carry the stuff out into the kitchen and throw it in the waste pail. For no reason at all she changed her mind and carried the ashtray with her across the hall and into the reception room. She placed it on the center table and then threw all the windows open. She had just started cleaning when a cry and then the sound of a body falling, came from the floor above.\n\nShe rushed into the hall. The old Mr. Boyer lay on the stairway near the landing of the floor above. Mrs. Nolan saw him seize the bannister and try to pull himself up. But when he was half erect, he collapsed again. Now Mr. Boyer was ordinarily a mild-mannered gentleman, but under certain condition, he was given to the use of colorful language. He got Mrs. Nolan and the butler and the chambermaid, all of whom had rushed to his assistance, rather excited.\n\nIt occurred to all three of them, at different times, that in case of accident it&#39;s a good idea to telephone to somebody. Three doctors, Mr. Boyer&#39;s office, a hospital and his lawyer were called up.\n\nNo one thought of an undertaker or the fire department. Verily, a sprain in the ankle maketh of man an unreasonable wretch.\n\nNeither of Mr. Boyer&#39;s sons happened to be in the office when the three telephone calls brought the news of the old man&#39;s injury. They had gone to transact outside business without leaving word of their movements. A secretary finally became alarmed and went out to the clerical department to notify Boyer&#39;s nephew, Mr. Kremp.\n\n&quot;There&#39;s been a terrible accident up at the Boyer home,&quot; said the secretary. &quot;The old man has been hurt … . Well no, I couldn&#39;t make out how. They&#39;re sure awful excited up at the home. Perhaps you&#39;d better go there.&quot;\n\nAccident … terrible … awful excitement— these were the words which kept ringing in Kremp&#39;s ears as he hurried up to the Boyer home. But why had only the old gentleman been hurt? Had he gone into the music room alone?\n\nKremp was admitted by the chambermaid. That young lady was still in the grip of her excitement. She led him to the reception room door and then, stating somewhat abruptly, that she would inform Mr. Boyer that he had come, turned and ran upstairs.\n\nNow, from the hall it was apparent that the music room was not a wreck. This was puzzling. Still, something was not in order. That was clear from the maid&#39;s actions.\n\nKremp went into the reception room. He was too preoccupied to notice that the windows were open and that the room was quite cold. He stood leaning against the center table. After a few moments he absently laid his lighted cigar into a brass ashtray.\n\nJust how much nonsense do you expect nitroglycerine to stand for? It had been scratched, scraped, tossed about carelessly and stepped on. Now the hot end of a cigar was being applied to it. Can yon blame it for raising a splutter?\n\nIt was a terrible mess for Mrs. Nolan to clean up.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nAn Explosive Fellow\n\n&quot;It was a most peculiar case,&quot; Mr. Boyer will tell you. &quot;The reception room was blown right out of the house and yet the most careful investigation could not disclose the original cause. It seems cruel to say so, but it would appear that Mr. Kremp&#39;s torrid temperament, which was long suppressed, suddenly exploded from spontaneous combustion. He used to have a sulphurous disposition, that gentleman. He was, you might say, an explosive fellow.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n\nFor Moriarity, it had been almost as hard to walk from the condemned cell to freedom by way of the main entrance as it would have been to take that other walk through the little door that leads to the electric chair. He had suffered all that a man can suffer who faces a horrid death. The last of a once iron nerve had been put into the task of dressing himself in his execution garments and when the order for a new trial had been read to him, the once powerful gang leader had silently crumpled in a heap on the floor.\n\nHe was all in—through—done for as surely as the electric chair could have finished him. Never again would he be able to hold a gun in his hand to take his place as the undisputed king of his world. They would not let him. He might try it but he knew they would find him out.\n\nNo man could hold his position, he told himself time after time, who had been through what he had endured. Try as he did to hide it, he knew that his old slaves and subjects had seen him tremble during the ridiculously easy second trial of his case. Even the assurances of his lawyers that it was &quot;all fixed,&quot; that his acquittal was a &quot;sure thing,&quot; could not sustain him. He could not keep his hands from shaking and the muscles of his face from working. The brazen effrontery of his stare, the menace of his squared shoulders, was gone. He had stammered as he told his prepared lie on the witness stand and he knew that his old henchmen were shaking their heads behind his back as they accompanied him in a sort of damp jubilation from the courtroom and back to the old rendezvous.\n\nWhat a farce it had been when, after the first rounds of drinks had been drunk to his return, Jeff Hardy had in formal argot surrendered his place as regent and formally handed him his old pistol as a token of renewed leadership of the gang. Leader? Why, he knew and they knew and he knew they knew he knew that he was not fit to be even an apprentice in that company of blood and steel. Every night for a week after that he could see in the darkness above his bed the sneer in the smile on Hardy&#39;s face as he &quot;surrendered&quot; the leadership which he had already found so sweet. Surrendered it? No wonder Jeff had sneered at the very idea.\n\nMoriarity had been a real leader of men. Guided into the realms of some great manufacturing enterprise, politics or finance he would have been as great as he had become in the world of violence and crime. Instead of the master of the men who work in steel or coal or gold, Fate had decreed that he should become the master of men who deal in crime. And just as disaster overtakes great leaders in great industry, so had disaster overtaken him on the night when &quot;Sailor&quot; Bradley had dared dispute his pre-eminence and met the death the code demanded.\n\nNo one in the underworld doubted who had killed Bradley. Moriarity was alive the next morning and Bradley was dead. That was evidence enough. But there was considerable surprise when the leader of the &quot;Woodchucks&quot; was sentenced to death for murder. Every resource was assembled to prevent his execution and obtain his freedom and these weapons had triumphed. They had brought back their leader but found they had only a weakling in his stead.\n\nWhy, there had been tears in his eyes when the verdict of his acquittal was read in court. Twice he had been seen faltering in his step as he came from the loft building in which the &quot;Woodchucks&quot; had their clubroom. He started at the slightest sound of anything like a pistol shot. And—worst of all—he refused to carry a gun.\n\nThat was the situation during two weeks following the old leader&#39;s return. Then, on a Sunday morning, Terence Moriarity, bright-eyed, square of shoulder, spring in his step and a smile on his face, had gleefully pummeled two new members of the gang who accidentally blocked his path, hurled a bottle through a clubroom window and undisputedly resumed his sway.\n\nThe night before, as all of the world that mattered to him well knew, Jeff Hardy had screamed Moriarity&#39;s name as he died and the old leader had automatically been crowned anew.\n\nIt did not matter so much to the &quot;Woodchucks&quot; how Hardy had died. That was a matter for the police to find out. The police did—to their own satisfaction at least—but Moriarity merely smiled at the sensation their theories caused. He still refused to carry a gun but he still led the &quot;Woodchucks,&quot; more feared and respected than he ever was and with confidence that his path of glory need not lead a man of intelligence again to the death house.\n\nJeff Hardy&#39;s body had been found at the bottom of the elevator shaft in the old loft building in which his gang occupied a portion of an upper floor. Without doubt he had fallen or been hurled six stories to the concrete pit below. That he had not committed suicide was certain. There was no reason why he should in the first place and in the second place two reliable witnesses swore they had heard him cry &quot;Damn you, Moriarity,&quot; as he fell.\n\nMoriarity had been arrested, of course, but released almost at once, because policemen as well as eminently respectable citizens had seen him a block away from the building at the same time that Hardy&#39;s scream was heard by the night watchman and elevator man of the building.\n\nIt had taken some time to drag Hardy&#39;s body from the pit and identify it. This caused a delay, but even at that the police admitted they probably would have been unable to make out a case against the old leader no matter how rapidly they worked.\n\nCaptain Bush, who knows probably as much about gangsters and gang politics as any police officer in the city, had ordered the arrest of Moriarity as soon as he heard of Hardy&#39;s death. He did that even before he knew that the old leader was the last man seen with the new chieftain. He was also the one who recommended the discharge of the prisoner the next morning.\n\n&quot;There are more ways than one of killing a cat,&quot; Captain Bush remarked philosophically to some of his newspaper friends, &quot;and the law doesn&#39;t keep up with all of them.&quot;\n\n&quot;But you admit Hardy was alone when he fell down the elevator shaft,&quot; persisted one of his questioners. &quot;Why do you think he was killed?&quot;\n\n&quot;He was killed as surely as Terence is again king of the Woodchucks,&quot; replied the police veteran. &quot;He was killed because Moriarity had lost his nerve. He was killed in the way he was because of the long nights Moriarity had spent in the death house, by a man who knew that if Hardy was killed by a shot he would walk through the little door instead of the big one on his second trip from his cell. He was killed by a man with brains and that imagination which had made him a tamed slayer.\n\n&quot;I know what happened as surely as I know I am sitting here, but there would be no use in going into court with it.\n\n&quot;Hardy had openly challenged the old leader&#39;s authority. Everybody knows that. Even the boys on the street were mocking Moriarity. He had wept in court. He had been seen twice walking unsteadily out of the building, wiping his eyes with his handkerchief and seeming to be half blinded by tears. Once the elevator man had to help him to the street. Everybody in the district knew about it. He was in pitiful terror at the thought of the time when Hardy would pull a gun on him and challenge him to fight it out. He knew that when that time came he would either have to go back to the death house, be killed by Hardy or disappear. There wasn&#39;t much choice. One was as bad as another for him. So, like the man of brains he is, he discarded all three of the obvious alternatives and found a fourth way out of the meeting he knew would have to come.\n\n&quot;It came last Saturday night. The two of them were alone in the clubroom. Not a man in the gang would have dared to stick his nose inside the door. They knew there would be no question about who their leader was before morning and there wasn&#39;t one of them within a mile of the place.\n\n&quot;The elevator man and the night watchman both heard them quarreling. They didn&#39;t hear the words, but we don&#39;t need them. Hardy taunted Moriarity to try to make him pull a gun. He had two—one his own and another for Moriarity in case he had none of his own. This second gun was loaded with blanks.\n\n&quot;There were two flasks in the room. One had gin in it and was still half full. The other was broken on the floor when Moriarity dropped it as Hardy pulled his gun and called upon him to fight.\n\n&quot;After dropping the flask, Moriarity walked out of the room and down the stairs, wiping the tears from his eyes as he had been seen doing twice before. The watchman saw him. The elevator man was on the top floor with his car. Moriarity had sent him there to put a new bolt on the roof scuttle. He swears the door at the club floor was closed when he went up—but elevator men always say that. Anyway the light was burning in the hall. That&#39;s all he knows until he heard Hardy scream.&quot;\n\n&quot;But how, then, did Moriarity kill him?&quot; a reporter asked as the captain relighted his cigar.\n\n&quot;Ever hear of this new tear gas?&quot; the policeman questioned. &quot;That&#39;s what was in the other flask.&quot;\n\n&quot;But wouldn&#39;t it blind Moriarity, too?&quot;\n\n&quot;It did. But he had experimented until he could find his way out of the building in spite of it. The effect wears off in a few minutes and by the time he had reached the corner he was merely crying a few tears and had his alibi all made to order. Meanwhile Hardy was blundering about until he found the elevator door and fell to his death.\n\n&quot;An act of Providence, I suppose the law might call it, but it was really the act of a damned clever devil.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Rumors and Stories\n  Facts and Truths\n  Confessions and Consequences\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nRumors and Stories\n\nAgnes Miller&#39;s good fortune was the talk of town and country when it was announced that she was to marry Norton Torrey. He was worth half a million dollars, which amounts to wealth, outside the big cities. He had lived for thirty years in Holliston, a pretty little town on the Delaware River, not far from the famous Water Gap, and always had enjoyed the distinction of being the richest man in the place.\n\nAt the time of his engagement to Miss Miller, he was fifty-four years old, and had been a widower for a decade. So far as was known to Holliston people, he had no near relatives except one son, from whom he was estranged. This son was engaged in a manufacturing business in Trenton, New Jersey, and was said to be almost as rich as his father.\n\nAgnes Miller was an orphan when she was four years old. Her father—who survived her mother a little over a year—left a few thousand dollars for his child&#39;s support. This sum was not very well managed by her guardian, but he made up in generosity what he lacked in business ability; and gave the girl a home and an education.\n\nWhen she was seventeen years old, she began to make a little money by writing stories, and thus ceased to be altogether a charge upon her guardian; but her literary ability was not of a high order, and it is doubtful whether she ever could have made a living with her pen.\n\nThis question ceased to be of interest, however, when she attracted the attention of Norton Torrey. It was a foregone conclusion that she would accept him, for, aside from his money, he was a man to win a woman. He was admitted to be by all odds the handsomest man, young or old, who ever had stepped inside the limits of that township. Holliston had two principal &quot;sights&quot; with which to delight visitors. One of them was Mr. Torrey&#39;s house, and the other was Mr. Torrey. He had a commanding figure; he always dressed exceptionally well; his manner was affable, and his conversation was brilliant.\n\nAn ideal husband, truly; and yet there were rumors that the first Mrs. Torrey had not been happy, and even that her death had been hastened by a hidden sorrow.\n\nWith a proper regard for his ward&#39;s interests, the guardian of Miss Miller tried to get some light upon the basis of these stories, but he failed. The girl herself considered them the malicious whisperings of envy. Not even the most hardened gossip dared to hint to Agnes that there was peril in marriage with Norton Torrey. She paid no heed to idle stories; she cared nothing that her husband would be much more than twice her age; she went to her bridal with a light heart, and with the surest expectation of happiness.\n\nSome months later, it was said of her, as of her predecessor in that household. that she was unhappy; but no one could say why. Two years went by; and then, of a sudden, Mr. Torrey&#39;s health failed most alarmingly. No one had ever known him to be ill. &quot;A constitution like Norton Torrey,&quot; had come to be an ordinary form of expression in the town.\n\nHe was a sad wreck when the iron strength that had sustained him through so many years failed at last. No one knew what was the matter with him. A distinguished expert in nervous diseases—summoned at great expense from Philadelphia—supplied the gossips with ponderous scientific names, which became even more incomprehensible after a few attempts at repetition.\n\nThe patient rallied, and soon was able to go out-of-doors; but it was evident to all who met him that he had failed in mind as well as in body, and that he never would be the same man again. He was eccentric and despondent, and as irritable as if he had been an invalid all his days.\n\nOf course, the sad change in him excited no end of talk; but the gossips soon had a better subject in the wife, whose friendship with George Harley, a young lawyer, was said to have become closer than propriety permitted.\n\nHarley was a fine-looking fellow, just out of a law school. He was the son of a well-to-do resident of Holliston, which accounts for his beginning practice in so small a field. For a year or more, he had a little legal work to do for Norton Torrey, but other clients came rarely to the door of his office.\n\nFinally, Torrey heard the stories about his wife and the young lawyer; there was a violent interview between the two men; and the result was that Harley&#39;s law business lost its mainstay. When this became known, there was considerable interest in the question whether Harley would seek a fresh field, since Holliston, which had been worth little, was now worth nothing. But he lingered on to the great satisfaction of the gossips.\n\nIt was an afternoon in May. Mrs. Torrey, rapidly crossing the hall in her magnificent home, met Doctor Frazer, the old village physician. He was surprised to see her—much more surprised than she, apparently.\n\n&quot;Where have you been?&quot; he cried. &quot;We have searched for you everywhere. We have been looking for you since one o&#39;clock.&quot;\n\n&quot;Is it possible?&quot; asked Mrs. Torrey calmly. &quot;What is the matter?&quot;\n\nThe physician did not mark, at the time, that she had not answered his question, but he remembered it afterward.\n\n&quot;Your husband is very ill,&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;Indeed?&quot; replied the lady, without seeming to note the physician&#39;s excited, almost frightened, demeanor. &quot;He seemed no worse than usual when I saw him this morning. I will go up to his room at once.&quot;\n\nShe ascended the stairs, and the old doctor followed her. His hand, upon the banister rail, trembled.\n\nThey found Norton Torrey in his bed. An elderly woman, Mrs. Eliza Ward, who had long been the principal servant in the house, was bending over him. It seemed that she was trying to make him swallow a potion, and that he was unable to do so. His teeth were clenched tightly; his face was pale, and showed the lines of recent and acute suffering. One hand was at his throat, as if he were choking.\n\nAt the sight of him, his wife&#39;s face became as pale as his. She stepped forward hastily.\n\nNorton Torrey&#39;s eyes were upon her, and their look was repellent. He murmured something in a harsh tone, but the words were indistinguishable. One hand remained at his throat, but the other, with which he had been supporting himself in bed, was raised with a peculiar gesture, pointing at his wife.\n\nSuddenly, with a deep groan, he fell back. A convulsive shudder shook his frame. Then he turned his face to the wall.\n\nThe physician leaned far over him, his knee upon the bed. With a strong effort, he turned the patient upon his back, and gazed intently into his face. Then he got down from the bed, and stood beside it with uplifted hand.\n\n&quot;Dead!&quot; screamed the wife, and she fell upon the floor, fainting.\n\nWhen they raised her up, there seemed to be as little life in her as in the form upon the bed; but when they had carried her into another room, the physician restored her to consciousness without much trouble. She speedily recovered full control of her faculties, so that she was able to ask calmly enough for the details of the sudden illness which had terminated fatally in her presence.\n\n&quot;I was sent for about one o&#39;clock.&quot; said the doctor. &quot;Your husband was then very ill, and I soon became alarmed at his condition. Of course, we immediately endeavored to find you. but we could not. I suppose that you were at the house of some friend. We sent to several places—Mrs. Warner&#39;s and others. Unfortunately, we did not send to the right place, wherever that may have been.&quot;\n\nThe doctor paused, as if expecting some reply, but Mrs. Torrey did not open her lips.\n\n&quot;Your husband had not been well during the forenoon,&quot; the physician continued. &quot;He had remained in his room.&quot;\n\n&quot;I was aware of that,&quot; said Mrs. Torrey.\n\n&quot;About noon, he sent to the kitchen for some beef broth, and it was made tor him. Immediately after taking it. he became violently ill. It seems almost as if there must have been something wrong with the broth. I have taken what remained in the bowl, and I shall examine it.&quot;\n\nDoctor Frazer was laboring under great excitement. As he stood before the lady, who sat with her arms resting upon a small table, his fingers played nervously with a fold of the tablecloth.\n\nMrs. Torrey looked up at him with an intense expression, which deepened into horror. She rose slowly, and leaned over the table, so that her face was near his.\n\n&quot;Do you mean to tell me,&quot; she demanded in a whisper, &quot;that my husband was poisoned?&quot;\n\nThe physician was silent for a full minute, during which time he eyed the woman&#39;s face with professional attention. What he saw there seemed to embolden him.\n\n&quot;Mrs. Torrey,&quot; he said, with a sudden access of firmness, &quot;it is my duty to tell you that your husband exhibited all the symptoms of poisoning with arsenic. Deeply as I regret the necessity of adding to your burden at this time, I must put the case into the hands of the authorities for a full investigation.&quot;\n\nHe was a man who had ever been faithful to the honorable rules of his profession, but the expression of his face had never been trained to keep a secret. It could be read at a glance.\n\n&quot;Wretch!&quot; cried the widow of an hour. &quot;Do you dare to accuse me?&quot;\n\n&quot;It is impossible that I should do so.&quot; he replied gently. &quot;There is absolutely no evidence. The case stands thus: This beef broth was prepared in the kitchen, by Mrs. Ward, a woman absolutely beyond suspicion, as I need not tell you. She put it into a bowl, and that into a plate, and carried it to the door of your husband&#39;s room.\n\n&quot;She knocked, and he came to the door, but did not open it. He told her to put the broth on that little stand which is near the door, and he would get it presently.\n\n&quot;Now, Mrs. Torrey, the critical point is this: No one knows how long the broth remained there. Any one in the house might have gone to the spot, and poured the poison into the bowl.&quot;\n\n&quot;But you are not sure that the broth was poisoned,&quot; cried the woman. &quot;My husband has been ill a long time. Natural causes might have—&quot;\n\nThe physician checked her with a wave of the hand.\n\n&quot;In the bottom of the bowl,&quot; he said, &quot;I found a white powder. Of course, I have had no time to analyze it chemically, even if I felt competent to undertake so serious an examination. Yet I have not a shadow of doubt that the powder is ordinary white arsenic.&quot;\n\nThe woman sank back into her chair.\n\n&quot;I am ill,&quot; she said, with a shudder. &quot;Will you call my maid?&quot;\n\nThe doctor touched a bell upon the table, and presently Mrs. Ward opened the door between the widow&#39;s room and that in which the master of the house lay dead.\n\n&quot;Mrs. Torrey wants her maid,&quot; said the doctor.\n\n&quot;Alice has gone,&quot; replied the housekeeper. &quot;She left, this morning, for good. Didn&#39;t you know it, Mrs. Torrey?&quot;\n\n&quot;I knew nothing of it,&quot; was the answer. &quot;Why did she go?&quot;\n\nThe housekeeper could give no information upon that point. Having said so, she left the room, and closed the door behind her.\n\n&quot;Let me urge upon you, Mrs. Torrey,&quot; said the physician, &quot;the importance of answering the question now: Where have you been since twelve o&#39;clock; when, so far as I know, you were last seen by anybody in this house, previous to my meeting you in the hall?&quot;\n\n&quot;I must decline to tell you,&quot; she replied.\n\nThe old physician, who had known her from her infancy, and had, with daily pleasure, seen her grow to beautiful womanhood, pleaded with her to shun the error of concealment in that hour of peril; but she would not heed his words. With a heart that was heavy with black doubts and fears, he left her to herself.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nFacts and Truths\n\n&quot;Mr. Sharpe,&quot; said George Harley, &quot;I have sought your assistance in this case from peculiar motives. In the first place, let me say that I have unlimited faith in your power. I believe that you can establish Mrs. Torrey&#39;s innocence, no matter what may be the evidence against her.&quot;\n\nThe great detective was standing by the window of the young lawyer&#39;s office, looking out upon the familiar beauties of the Delaware.\n\n&quot;Do you mean,&quot; he said, &quot;that you think I can establish her innocence, even if she is guilty? Do not harbor such a thought. You are her legal counsel. It is your duty—or, at least, it is your privilege—to free her by any legal means in your power. My case is different. I shall regard only the facts; and, by the way, the sooner I learn whatever may be known to you the better.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then let us see how the case stands,&quot; said Harley. &quot;In the first place, let me say, that the very devil himself has been in it. The evidence which the prosecution will bring is absolutely conclusive. I know exactly what the case against my client will be, and it is strong enough to convict a saint.\n\n&quot;To begin with, Torrey&#39;s whole life will be raked over. That will be done to show the motive, or, rather, to strengthen the force of it.\n\n&quot;Do you know what that man was? Of course not; you have had no chance to find out. Well, that cultured and dignified gentleman, that walking model of all the virtues, that paragon, whose physical beauty was a perpetual lecture to young men on the rewards of a correct life, is now known to have been that most deplorable of wretches—a secret tippler, a home drunkard.\n\n&quot;Incredible, isn&#39;t it? Yet it is true. That was what broke his first wife&#39;s heart. That was the horror which Agnes discovered within a month after she married that man.\n\n&quot;Almost every evening, in the seclusion of his room, whose privacy no servant dared to violate, Norton Torry drugged himself with liquor. His indulgence was such that it would have sent almost any other man to the grave. Yet so miraculous was the strength of his constitution, that he would awake, after a secret debauch, with scarcely a trace of it about him. A half hour&#39;s vigorous exercise, a plunge into cold water, a careful toilet—and the beast of a few hours before would be transformed into the gentleman that poor Agnes Miller had loved.\n\n&quot;And this wretched farce had been going on for years and years. Talk about the secrets of a great city! Go to the country, if you want to probe the miserable deceptions of human life.\n\n&quot;The first Mrs. Torrey had suffered in silence. Her son had left his father&#39;s house in disgust, but had breathed no word of reproach that the world could hear. I don&#39;t know how much Mrs. Ward knew, but she did not open her lips. Agnes followed their example as best she could.\n\n&quot;It couldn&#39;t last forever. Torres&#39;s health endured beyond the bonds of all hunt an experience, but it had to give up some time. And when it failed, the ruin of body and mind was awful. Oh, he was a nice man to live with, was Norton Torrey! First a drunkard, and then a maniac!&quot;\n\n&quot;And a rich man all the time.&quot; said Sharpe. &quot;I think you have established the motive. Mrs. Torrey would have been more than human if she had not longed to be a widow.\n\n&quot;The prosecution will say as much,&quot; rejoined Harley; &quot;and they will also make some references to myself, if they dare; but I warn them that the man who ventures to intimate that my relations with Agnes were more than friendly, may expect to join the saints in paradise or the fiends in perdition, according to his deserts, and that speedily.&quot;\n\nHe spoke with the tone of a man who meant what he said. The detective regarded him curiously, remembering that he, also, had a motive for desiring Norton Torrey&#39;s death.\n\n&quot;They will prove,&quot; continued Harley, &quot;that Torrey died of arsenical poisoning. I shall not be able to contest that. Chemical analysis has shown the presence of arsenic in the body.\n\n&quot;A part of the powder found in the bowl from which Torrey had taken the beef broth has been analyzed. It is white arsenic.\n\nAlbert Dunning, a young druggist, who recently opened a first-rate store on the center below here, will testify that Alice Holden, Mrs. Torrey&#39;s maid, bought white arsenic powder at his store on the evening before the day of Torrey&#39;s death.\n\n&quot;It was hard work getting that evidence for it will hurt Dunning in this town, and he knows it well. If it hadn&#39;t been that one of his clerks saw the sale made, I think the fact might never have come out. You see, Dunning was in a fair way to run old Doctor Seabrook, the other druggist, out of the business, and this will turn the tables.\n\n&quot;It is rough on Dunning, for, by all accounts, he didn&#39;t want to make the sale. But the Holden girl told him that Mrs. Torrey wanted the stuff to poison rats—the house was overrun with them. It&#39;s the old story, of course. Dunning was afraid of disobliging so influential a woman as Agnes, and so he finally sold the stuff.\n\n&quot;&#39;About half of it was found wrapped in paper in a little drawer in a table in Mrs. Torrey&#39;s room. She doesn&#39;t know how it came there, and I don&#39;t pretend to understand that feature of the case.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where is Alice Holden?&quot; asked Sharpe.\n\n&quot;She has not been found,&quot; was the reply. &quot;Of course, it is natural to suspect her, but that theory will not work. It is positively proved that she left this town early in the morning. She has been traced to New York. It is utterly impossible that she could have put the poison into that broth, for she was a hundred miles away when it was done.\n\n&quot;To proceed, every servant in the house has been examined, and every one can clear himself or herself, as the case may be. There is no doubt whatever that the poison was put into the broth while it was on the little stand outside the door of Torrey&#39;s room. During that time, not one of the servants was alone. In short, though I naturally want to take a contrary view, I am forced to admit that they are all innocent.&quot;\n\n&quot;How about Mrs. Ward, the housekeeper ?&quot; asked Sharpe. &quot;I understand that she made the broth and carried it upstairs.&quot;\n\n&quot;She had no motive,&quot; was the reply; &quot;and her character will clear her. She is one of the best of women, and everybody in this town knows it. I haven&#39;t the faintest suspicion that she did the deed; and, in any case, as a lawyer, I know that it will be perfectly useless to try to throw suspicion upon her.&quot;\n\n&quot;You are perfectly right in that view,&quot; said Sharpe. &quot;Such an attempt would only injure your client. Now, let us return to Mrs. Torrey. Where was she at the critical moment?&quot;\n\nHarley twisted about in his seat, and seemed afraid to answer, though it was evident that he had made up his mind beforehand to do so.\n\n&quot;She was in the house,&quot; said he at last.\n\n&quot;How did it happen that she was not summoned when her husband was taken ill?&quot; demanded the detective.\n\n&quot;The servants did not find her,&quot; replied Harley. &quot;She was in an unused room, which is always locked. No one thought of going there.&quot;\n\n&quot;Was she alone?&quot;\n\nAgain Harley hesitated.\n\n&quot;No,&quot; he said finally; &quot;I was with her.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then, why do you not come forward and clear her?&quot;\n\n&quot;For several reasons,&quot; was the answer. &quot;First, it would damage her reputation.&quot;\n\n&quot;Scarcely so much as an accusation of murder,&quot; suggested Sharpe.\n\n&quot;A woman has strange preferences,&quot; said Harley. &quot;Agnes commands me to be silent. As a matter of fact, I ought not to have been there, but the case was getting to be desperate. Life in that house was becoming unbearable for her. We were discussing the means of ending her captivity.&quot;\n\n&quot;An elopement?&quot; suggested Sharpe.\n\n&quot;Heaven knows!&quot; cried Harley. &quot;It might have come to that. I urged it, for I was mad with love for her. She refused, though she admitted her love for me. Ah, her behavior was noble! Her words might be shouted in the street, and they would do good to all who heard them. Only the secrecy of our meeting was wrong; but in a little town like this, what can one do? She couldn&#39;t come to my office for legal advice. All the gossips were watching.&quot;\n\n&quot;Were you with her all the time?&quot; asked Sharpe.\n\n&quot;All but a moment,&quot; replied the young man.\n\n&quot;She left you in that room?&quot;\n\n&quot;No; I left her there.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why?&quot;\n\n&quot;I went to get a document which was in a writing table in the library.&quot;\n\n&quot;What was that document?&quot;\n\n&quot;A deed of some property, executed by Torrey in favor of his wife.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why did not Mrs. Torrey get it?&quot;\n\n&quot;Because she did not know exactly where it was.&quot;\n\n&quot;Did you not take a risk in passing through the halls at that time?&quot; asked Sharpe. &quot;You did not wish any one to know that you were in the house.&quot;\n\n&quot;That was not important,&quot; answered Harley. &quot;If I had been seen, I should simply have gone to Torrey&#39;s door and rapped. We quarreled once, you know, but of late our relations had been more cordial. I had to take care when it came to the matter of a long, private conversation with Agnes.&quot;\n\n&quot;What time was it when you left that room?&quot;\n\n&quot;About half past twelve.&quot;\n\n&quot;Do you suppose that broth was standing outside Torrey&#39;s door at that time?&quot;\n\n&quot;I know it was,&quot; said Harley, &quot;for I saw it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, upon my word,&quot; said Sharpe, &quot;this is one of the most peculiar situations that I ever saw. You can clear your client if you go upon the stand as a witness, but in so doing you will cast the gravest suspicion upon yourself.&quot;\n\n&quot;That is the point that I&#39;ve been working up to,&quot; said Harley calmly. &quot;Who poisoned Norton Torrey, I don&#39;t know; but one thing is sure: Sooner than see Agnes bear the blame, I will go on the stand, whether she is willing or not. And, if the worst comes, and she is sure to be convicted, I will not only tell the truth, I will go farther; I will lie upon my oath, and say that I put that poison into the broth myself!&quot;\n\n&quot;Let us hope it will not come to that.&quot; said Sharpe.\n\n&quot;My only hope is in you,&quot; replied Harley.\n\n&quot;One more question, and I am done: Could Mrs. Torrey have left that room and you not know it?&quot;\n\n&quot;Impossible! She must have passed me in the halls or on the stairs. While I was getting that paper, the library door was open, and I could see the bowl of broth standing outside the door.&quot;\n\nThis concluded Sharpe&#39;s talk with Harley. From his office, the detective went to the drug store of Doctor Seabrook. The old druggist had assisted in some of the analyses that had been made, and had seen all the chemists&#39; reports, so that Sharpe expected to get accurate data from him. In this he was not disappointed. Doctor Seabrook made it clear to the detective that the case was a genuine one of arsenical poisoning, and that it must be futile to attempt to shake the chemical expert testimony.\n\nThe veteran druggist was very bitter against his young rival in business for having sold poison so recklessly. As to the actual crime, he stoutly defended Mrs. Torrey, and asserted his belief that the case was one of accident, or that the missing maid had done the deed.\n\nAs to this missing woman, Sharpe was much perplexed. It was impossible that she should have done the deed; yet it was admitted that she had bought the poison, and her flight was highly suspicious. She had had a quarrel with her mistress a few days before, but it had not been serious enough to warrant a desperate revenge, or even a sudden quitting of the house.\n\nThe detective had very little time in which to work, for he was very desirous of clearing Mrs. Torrey—if. indeed, she was innocent—at the inquest, which was called for the day after that on which Sharpe reached Holliston. It is, however, no new thing for the detective to be in a hurry; and he used his scanty time to so good advantage that when he appeared at the inquest the next morning he felt in the highest degree satisfied with the status of the case.\n\nIt will not be necessary to enter upon any detailed account of that somewhat remarkable inquiry. The climax came when the representative of the district attorney produced two samples of poison, one of which had been obtained by drying the powder found in the bowl which had held the beef broth, while the other was taken from the little package found in Mrs. Torrey&#39;s room.\n\n&quot;These two are identical,&quot; he said. &quot;They are both white arsenic, a well-known deadly poison, unfortunately too common, and too easily obtained.&quot;\n\nAt this point, Carson Sharpe, who occupied a seat beside the coroner on the bench, desired to know whether the package found in Mrs. Torrey&#39;s room could be proven to be that which the maid had bought. He was informed that the wrapper bore the druggist&#39;s stamp. Druggist Dunning, crestfallen, nodded despondently on the witness&#39; bench. Druggist Seabrook scowled triumphantly.\n\n&quot;Will you permit me to make a brief experiment?&quot; asked Sharpe; and nobody objected, for they all stood in considerable awe of the detective.\n\nThereupon, Sharpe took the two packages of poison and poured a small quantity of powder from one of them into a glass tube, and an equal amount from the other package into another tube. Then, producing a small vial of colorless liquid, he poured some of it into the tube which held the powder taken from Mrs. Torrey&#39;s room.\n\nThere was no visible result, and coroner, jury, lawyers, and spectators looked very much disappointed. Then Sharpe poured some of the same liquid into the other lube which contained the powder taken from the broth.\n\nInstantly there was a lively effervescence. The tube was as full of bubbles as a glass of soda water. The jurymen opened their eyes, the spectators rose to their feet and craned their necks to see.\n\n&quot;Mr. Sharpe,&quot; said the coroner, &quot;I do not quite understand the meaning of the experiment you have performed, but I perceive that it is important. It seems to show that the poison found in the broth is not the same as that found in Mrs. Torrey&#39;s room.&quot;\n\n&quot;On the contrary,&quot; said Sharpe, &quot;the poison is exactly the same. Yet I tell you that I have proved that the drug bought by Mrs. Torrey&#39;s maid was not used to poison Mr. Torrey.\n\n&quot;Let me explain: White arsenic, in the form of powder, as it is sold in drug stores, is rarely pure. It is adulterated with various cheap substances similar in appearance.\n\n&quot;As I have said, the poison which the maid bought is the same as that found in the broth, but the substance used in adulterating the two was not the same.\n\n&quot;That bought by the maid was adulterated with sulphate of calcium; that which killed Mr. Torrey was mixed with carbonate of calcium—in other words, with chalk dust.\n\n&quot;I prove this by adding acid to both powders. It produces no effect upon the sulphate of calcium, but it breaks up the chalk, setting free carbonic acid gas—the ordinary soda-water gas.\n\n&quot;The chemists who have analyzed these two samples, paid no attention to the adulterant. They took it for granted. If the same chemist had prepared both analyses, he would have noticed the difference; but the two reports mention only the white arsenic, since the other substances were harmless.\n\n&quot;Now, what does this prove? Why, it proves that the fatal dose was not bought at Dunning&#39;s store. He gets his white arsenic of Abel, Hanniford &amp;amp; Co., of New York, who use sulphate of calcium as an adulterant.\n\n&quot;On the other hand. Doctor Seabrook buys his white arsenic of Seamen, Wilbur &amp;amp; Co., of Baltimore, and they use powdered chalk. I learned these facts yesterday afternoon.\n\n&quot;Mr. Coroner, if you will permit me to do so, I will suggest that you call Doctor Seabrook to the stand.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nConfessions and Consequences\n\nThe druggist came up, flushed and trembling.\n\n&quot;Question him, Mr. Sharpe,&quot; said the coroner, and the district attorney acquiesced.\n\nLittle questioning was necessary. The old druggist saw himself detected, and he confessed. He had sold the white arsenic which had proved fatal in this case, and the person who had bought it was Norton Torrey!\n\nThe druggist had known how criminal an act it was to sell poison to such a half-mad creature, but he had not dared to offend Torrey, who for many years had secretly bought his liquors through Doctor Seabrook. Not daring to disclose his error, the druggist had taken the risk of sending Mrs. Torrey to the scaffold by his silence.\n\nIt became evident that the case was one of suicide, and when that view was presented, no one was surprised. Torrey&#39;s suicide had been predicted since his mental failing had been noticed.\n\nAfter Seabrook had left the stand, Sharpe explained the purchase of the poison by the maid, and the fact that a considerable portion of it was missing from the package found in Mrs. Torrey&#39;s room.\n\nThe detective, after becoming convinced that the maid had not contributed in any way to the death of Torrey, had sought for a motive for buying the poison.\n\nSearching the house and surroundings, he had come upon the dead body of a pet dog that had been owned by Mrs. Torrey. The dog had died of arsenic. In the excitement of the tragedy in the house, the loss of the dog had not been noticed.\n\nIt was evident that the maid had poisoned the dog in revenge for the quarrel she had had with the mistress, who had prized the animal highly. Having done this cruel and brutal act, the maid had fled.\n\nThis discovery cleared the case up thoroughly. It had ended in a manner most satisfactory to Harley and Mrs. Torrey, for Sharpe&#39;s disclosure had come in time to shield them.\n\nIt was the detective&#39;s opinion that the wife&#39;s conduct had not been so blamable as it had at first appeared, so far as Harley was concerned. He was not sorry that she would inherit the fortune of the man who had clouded her young life by his intemperance; and he viewed with equanimity the practical certainty that Harley would eventually share the money.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Manners sat alone in the upstairs room of the station. He watched the man cross the room.\n\n&quot;Excuse me, sir,&quot; said the stranger, &quot;but are you the detective in charge?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; said Manners. &quot;What can I do for you?&quot; The man glanced about him, and, seeing they were alone, he sighed and sat down heavily beside the desk.\n\n&quot;I—I dislike doing this,&quot; he began, &quot;but I feel it my duty. The madame was always good to me. We thought it best that a report be made to the police.&quot;\n\nManners sat up. &quot;Who are &#39;we&#39;,&quot; he asked.\n\n&quot;Why, the cook, the second butler, and the maids, sir. And myself. I am head of the servants.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;d better begin at the beginning,&quot; said Manners.\n\nThe butler nodded gravely.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right. I am John Fisher, and I have been in the service of Mr. Samuel Ryan for ten years. This is a delicate matter I am about to confide in you. The madame, who is a good many years younger than the master, has completely disappeared. The master&#39;s disposition is jealous; he was very jealous of the madame, because of his nature and because she, being much younger than he, liked to go out and enjoy herself, dancing and the like. Since she disappeared, four nights ago, the master has scarcely stirred from his rooms.\n\nManners had taken this in with professional ear, discounting the story because of servants&#39; usual gossip.\n\n&quot;Probably Mrs. Ryan has just gone away for a time,&quot; he said easily.\n\nThe butler shook his head. &quot;I do not think so. According to her maid, none of Mrs. Ryan&#39;s clothes are missing, except those she wore the night she disappeared.&quot;\n\nThis seemed to interest the detective. He drummed on the desk for a moment with his stubby fingers; then he rose and took up his hat, setting it at a jaunty angle.\n\n&quot;Come along,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;ll go out and see Mr. Ryan. Hell be able to set matters straight.&quot;\n\nThe butler hesitated. &quot;I would not wish him to know that I had reposted the matter—&quot;\n\n&quot;All right. Give me the directions, and I&#39;ll give you a chance to get to the house first.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Refusal to Talk\n\nIt was almost ten p.m. when Manners stepped to the bell of the Long Island mansion set off by itself in immense grounds.\n\nThe second butler answered the door.\n\n&quot;I want to see Mr. Ryan,&quot; said Manners. &quot;If he asks who it is, say it&#39;s the police.&quot;\n\nThe butler nodded understandingly. Evidently he was in league with Fisher. He asked Manners to come inside, and then went up the broad staircase.\n\nHe came down a minute later, looking frightened. &quot;He—he refuses to see you. sir,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#39;s in a terrible state. Perhaps you&#39;d better come back—&quot;\n\nManners shook his head roughly. &quot;I&#39;ll go up,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ll make him talk to me.&quot;\n\n&quot;But—&quot; began the butler, trying to stand in his way, though in a half-hearted fashion.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll tell him I pushed my way in,&quot; said the detective. &quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot;\n\nHe went swiftly up the stairs, the butler behind him. &quot;Where&#39;s his room?&quot;\n\nThe butler pointed to a closed door.\n\nManners knocked with no uncertain fist upon the closed door. A heavy voice growled out a question.\n\n&quot;Detective Manners of New York City headquarters,&quot; called the detective through the closed door.\n\n&quot;Go away. I don&#39;t want to see a detective.&quot;\n\n&quot;The detective wants to see you, though,&quot; said Manners. &quot;Open the door.&quot;\n\nThe voice showed the rage of the man inside.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll break you, man, if you don&#39;t leave my house. What do you mean by forcing your way in here? I&#39;ve given you fair warning: go away.&quot;\n\n&quot;If you don&#39;t open the door, I&#39;ll be forced to break it in,&quot; answered the detective, ignoring the threat.\n\nA moment later, the door was unlocked from within and flung violently open. Before him stood a tall, sinister-looking man of sixty, hair in disorder, eyes sunken with deep circles about them, and drawn face. He wore a silk dressing-gown over his shirt and trousers, and his feet were encased in leather slippers. In one band he held a half-smoked cigar.\n\n&quot;Well—now what do you want?&quot; he demanded.\n\n&quot;I want to speak to you,&quot; said the detective.\n\nHe pushed past the man into the room.\n\n&quot;Your wife has been missing for four days,&quot; said Manners, without waiting for the outburst. &quot;Why have you made no report?&quot;\n\n&quot;Who told you this?&#39;&#39; growled Ryan.\n\n&quot;The neighbors reported it,&quot; said Manners to protect Fisher.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s none of your damn business. What do you mean by breaking in this way?&quot;\n\n&quot;It is the business of a policeman to investigate mysterious disappearances,&quot; said Manners. &quot;Where is your wife?&quot;\n\nRyan hesitated. Then he said, &quot;She has gone away on a visit. Now, get out and leave me in peace.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where has she gone?&quot;\n\nRyan&#39;s temper was not of the best, and at this persistence he flew into a terrible rage. For fully five minutes he stormed at the imperturbable Manners.\n\n&quot;Go to hell! Get out of my house! I&#39;ll break you, my man! You&#39;ll pay dearly for this intrusion.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where&#39;s Mrs. Ryan?&quot; repeated Manners.\n\n&quot;I refuse to speak to you. If you don&#39;t go, I&#39;ll call my servants and have you thrown out.&quot;\n\nManners looked at the furious man. &quot;If you do that,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;ll be forced to put in a charge of murder against you.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nMrs. Ryan&#39;s Dead Body\n\nRyan blanched. He went unsteadily to a large armchair and sank into it.\n\n&quot;Shut the door,&quot; he said at last.\n\nManners complied, and took a chair opposite Ryan. &quot;What I am about to say you must hold confidential, strictly confidential,&quot; said Ryan.\n\nHe stared at the little fire in the fireplace nearby. &quot;What has happened, then?&quot; asked Manners.\n\n&quot;She has gone away with another man.&quot;\n\n&quot;Who&#39;s the other man?&quot; asked Manners.\n\n&quot;A young whippersnapper named Carstairs. He lived nearby, and was here a great deal of the time.&quot;\n\n&quot;How do you know they went away together? Were they seen?&quot;\n\nRyan shook his head. &quot;I am certain of it, because he has disappeared also. His family called me to ask if he was here; he left the night my wife disappeared. They were seen walking together about the grounds at eight o&#39;clock; at ten, I tried to find them and could not.&quot;\n\nThe detective could see the pain under which the man was laboring, the pain of jealousy and broken pride.\n\nSo this was the explanation of Mrs. Ryan&#39;s disappearance. Manners mused for a moment upon servants&#39; gossip; then he rose.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll leave you, then,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I intruded.&quot;\n\nRyan spoke no more; Manners left him with his head sunk on his breast, staring at the fire.\n\nDownstairs, Fisher, the butler, was waiting.\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; said the man, &quot;did you find out what happened to the madame?&quot;\n\nManners nodded. &quot;She&#39;s gone away on a visit to a sick aunt,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about her. It&#39;s all right.&quot;\n\nHe left the house and went back to headquarters.\n\nNext afternoon, he made a trip to the town on the outskirts of which Ryan lived. There he made inquiries concerning George Carstairs, the man Ryan said had run away with his wife, Elizabeth. The Carstairs&#39; home was not so pretentious as Ryan&#39;s; the grounds were smaller and not so well kept Carstairs, a large blond man of thirty-five, had lived with his parents. He had the reputation of being rather fast.\n\nManners had a description of the woman, Elizabeth Ryan, as small, dark-haired, pretty.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s none of my business now,&quot; he thought.\n\nBut the picture of the sad husband sitting with his head sunk on his breast kept recurring to him.\n\n&quot;I wonder if I could get her back?&quot; he said aloud.\n\nIt was worth trying. He made a visit to the home of Carstairs, and questioned the parents of the man, two old people who answered him politely but with a great deal of constraint. Evidently they knew or guessed where their son was. But they could not disclose his whereabouts to Manners.\n\nThe detective managed to steal a picture of the young man from a mantelpiece. He already had acquired one of Mrs. Ryan. With these, he broadcast a description of the runaways.\n\nThe days ran on, with no news. More cases, cruder and more pressing, took up Manners&#39; thoughts.\n\nThen he had a &#39;phone call from Fisher, the butler. The man&#39;s voice was very excited.\n\n&quot;Come out at once, said Fisher. &quot;We&#39;ve found something. Hurry!&quot;\n\n&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Manners.\n\n&quot;Mrs. Ryan&#39;s dead body,&quot; came the voice. &quot;Hurry!&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Master&#39;s Heavy Cane\n\nThe perplexed Manners arrived after dark, and was met at the station by Fisher.\n\nThe butler was very perturbed, and spoke rapidly as the limousine whisked them toward Ryan&#39;s home.\n\n&quot;The gardener chanced upon it, sir,&quot; said Fisher. &quot;She was but a foot or so under the ground, in the bushes.&quot;\n\n&quot;Have you told your master?&quot; asked Manners.\n\n&quot;No. I thought it best to leave everything as it was, until you came. The gardener is guarding the spot.&quot;\n\nIn an outlying patch of hedge, they found the excited gardener, standing over the grave.\n\n&quot;Look what I&#39;ve found, sir,&quot; he said, holding out a stick to the detective, who was already examining the body of the murdered woman by the aid of his flash.\n\nManners took the stick. It was a man&#39;s heavy cane.\n\n&quot;D&#39;you know whose this is?&quot; he asked.\n\nAfter an examination, Fisher answered. &quot;It&#39;s the master&#39;s,&quot; he said in a low voice.\n\n&quot;Where&#39;d you find this?&quot; asked Manners.\n\n&quot;It was in the bushes nearby,&quot; answered Phillips, the gardener.\n\nAn examination of the dead woman&#39;s throat showed marks of strangulation; her black hair held dried blood, and after a good look at the cane, Manners concluded that she had been struck upon the head with it.\n\nManners&#39; mind was working fast. &quot;If Ryan did this,&quot; he mused aloud, &quot;we&#39;ll find Carstairs&#39; body nearby.&quot;\n\nAll through the night, and into the morning, they searched for another grave, but in vain.\n\nThe exhausted detective at last left the search in the hands of the gardener, and went to the mansion. He discovered Ryan in his apartment.\n\n&quot;Your wife&#39;s body has been found,&quot; said Manners.\n\nRyan started. &quot;My God! What do you mean?&quot;\n\n&quot;She&#39;s been murdered—struck on the head, and strangled, too. What have you to say?&quot;\n\n&quot;Say? What is there to say? Where is she?&quot;\n\n&quot;Where&#39;s Carstairs&#39; body?&quot; the detective asked sternly. &quot;Where did you hide it?&quot;\n\n&quot;I? I hide Carstairs&#39; body? Man, don&#39;t you see—he&#39;s killed her. He&#39;s killed her!&quot;\n\n&quot;Your cane struck the blow that cither killed your wife or knocked her unconscious,&quot; said Manners coldly.\n\nRyan repeated his denials. He wept when he viewed the body of his wife.\n\nThe search for Carstairs&#39; body went on. Ryan was taken into custody. The case was strong against him.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nYes, I Killed her\n\nRyan had been in prison for two weeks, when Manners received a surprise. It was in the form of a message from the police of Chicago. Carstairs had been found, or a man answering Carstairs&#39; description.\n\nRyan remembered his action—sending out descriptions of Mrs. Ryan and Carstairs—in order to bring back the runaway wife.\n\nThe detective went to Chicago.\n\nHe found at the police station a large, blond-headed man, with a light beard. Carstairs it was.\n\nHe answered Manners&#39; questions wearily.\n\nAfter some hours of questioning, the prisoner asked for a drink of water. He spoke in a husky tone.\n\n&quot;My God!&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. You&#39;re driving me crazy. I&#39;m almost crazy as it is. I can&#39;t get it off my mind. I loved her, I loved Elizabeth. I thought she loved me. We were together all the time.\n\n&quot;It was like this: I had been asking her to run away with me. Ryan was jealous of me. Elizabeth and I had been going out a great deal together. She half promised to go with me. That night I called at eight, and she came out with me for a walk. As we passed the rack in the hall, she picked up her husband&#39;s cane, and we stepped out into the grounds.\n\n&quot;I argued with her for a full hour; and she said she would never go with me, that she had thought it over, and knew she could not leave her husband.\n\n&quot;I was crazy for her; she had driven me beyond endurance. I tried to pick her up and carry her off; she struck at me with the cane, and I snatched it from her, and in blind frenzy, hit her over the head. In my rage, I grasped her throat as she lay there, scarcely breathing, telling her she must go with me.\n\n&quot;I came to myself a few moments later, and found she was dead. I tried to kill myself there, too; but I was too much of a coward. I buried her hastily, and, throwing the cane in the bushes after wiping it off, ran away. I have been wandering ever since. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s all over. I could not have stood it much longer. Yes, I killed her,&quot; said Carstairs.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Then he turned and swung sharp eyes at the group huddled behind him.\n\n“I suppose,” he said wearily, “none of you know anything about this—”\n\nThree heads shook quickly, involuntarily.\n\nClint Fleming glanced down again at the body of the slender young man. A florist’s knife—the kind used for trimming flowers—was in his chest, in the center of a crimson splash on his white shirtfront. Only the green enameled handle was visible. The head and shoulders were part way under the worktable, and the thin little coroner was complaining bitterly as he crawled out, stood up and brushed off his knees.\n\n“Why,” he asked no one, “do corpses always get themselves in such awkward positions?”\n\nHe picked up his worn satchel, clapped his hat on his head, and said briskly, “I’ll send my report around as usual. Fellow’s been dead about ten hours.”\n\nClint Fleming nodded absently, and nudged the gilt letters that lay in confusion on the cement floor with the toe of his shoe. In his hand he held the letter U he had picked from the dead man’s fingers. The pigeonholed box that had held the letters lay overturned, empty. A cluster of M’s were scattered near the lifeless hand.\n\n“Okay, cover him up,” Detective Fleming jerked over his shoulder to one of the blue-coated officers. Then he turned back to the silent three.\n\nThe redhead was crying soundlessly into her handkerchief.\n\n“All right,” he said, “let’s get down to cases. Tell me again what happened.”\n\nThe girl spoke. Her name was Pat Murray; she was new in the store, learning the flower business. She had discovered the body of Fred Jensen that morning when she had come down to the basement to bring up some vases.\n\n“Who called the police?” Clint asked.\n\nThe tall, sallow young man on the girl’s right answered. “I did. I’m Jack Unger. I deliver the orders. Pat came screaming up the stairs—”\n\n“Unger,” Clint repeated. He glanced down at the paper letter in his hand and his gray eyes narrowed.\n\nThe young man flushed. “Just because that letter was—” he moistened dry lips— “in Fred’s hand, it doesn’t mean—”\n\n“Damn it,” Clint interrupted sharply, “it means something! Why would he have picked out a U? You use these letters to print out sentiments on ribbons, don’t you? For funeral pieces?”\n\nAt his last words the girl squeezed her blue eyes shut, pressed the back of her hand against her mouth. Her slim shoulders trembled under her smock. Jack Unger touched her arm lightly and she drew away.\n\n“It’ll be all right, Pat,” he said softly.\n\nShe did not answer.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nLilacs\n\nThe man on her left spoke for the first time. He was short and stocky,, his black eyes antagonistic.\n\n“Listen, Mister,” he told Clint, “Pat’s had about all she can stand. We don’t know any more than we told you.”\n\nClint looked at him. A brief smile flickered on his lips. Then he shrugged. “Sure,” he said kindly, “but somebody has to ask questions. The Chief has plopped this case in my lap. It’s up to me.”\n\nClint thought: this being a detective isn’t so hot. Nobody likes you —they’re afraid if they do you’ll turn around and pin a murder rap on them.\n\nHe glanced at Pat and she looked hastily away. Any other time, under the right circumstances, a girl like that would smile if a fellow’s eyes showed that he thought— Clint broke off his thoughts. He hadn’t missed the look that crossed her face when Unger touched her arm. Or the fact that the paper U in his hand was the second letter of her last name. It was also the second letter of murder.\n\nHad Fred Jenson been trying to spell cut something?\n\n“Where’s the boss?” Clint asked suddenly. “Who is the Davies this store is named after?” He looked a question at the stocky, dark man.\n\n“My name’s Herb Martin. Thomas Davies owns the store. He’s usually here, but he’s been home the past few days. Heart trouble.”\n\n“He’s been notified?”\n\nThe man nodded. “He said the police are welcome to come out and he’ll tell them what he knows.” Clint made a wry face. “Helpful people rarely know anything of use,” he observed. He started to walk toward the stairs that led up into the shop.\n\n“I wouldn’t take any sudden trips, if I were you,” he told them. Then, with his hand on the wooden banister, he stopped. He took r deep breath of the damp air.\n\nHe turned to Pat Murray and asked slowly, “Isn’t that lilacs I smell?”\n\nShe nodded and pointed to a large table that stood against a gloom-shrouded wall. “They’re over there. We have more upstairs.”\n\nClint pursed his lips. His words, when he brought them out, were careful. “Last week I tried to buy some lilacs—I was told that the season has been over for a half a month. How come you still have them?”\n\nThe girl started to speak, but Herb Martin interrupted with,\n\n“So we’re lucky? So what difference does that make?”\n\n“None at all—I suppose,” Cliff told him slowly. Then he leaned forward and his words were chill, “You know,” he said, “I don’t think I’m going to like you. And if I were you—I wouldn’t make me positive of it.”\n\nThen he looked past the man. “You can have the body taken away,” he told one of the officers.\n\nHe went on up the stairs.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nSuspects\n\nTom Davies seemed more than anxious to help and he sat in a deep leather chair, his bread face puckered into a frown of worry, his fingers picking at the front of his dressing gown. His false teeth flashed whitely when he spoke.\n\n“A terrible thing,” he said. “A terrible thing, really. Fred was a nice boy. Why anyone should—”\n\n“He had no enemies?”\n\nTom Davies’ eyebrows drew down. “I don’t want to say anything that will put blame—but, well, he and Tack Unger were both interested in Pat.”\n\n“And she preferred Jensen?”\n\nThe man nodded. “I don’t think Jack would have—”\n\n“What about Herb Martin?”\n\n“Ob, he’s all right. Bit of a temper, but—”\n\nClint sighed. “You think Unger did it?”\n\nDavies stiffened. “I didn’t say that! In fact—” his eyes narrowed— “this would be just the sort of thing Mike Slone would have wanted to happen. He—” He broke off.\n\n“Go on.”\n\n“Well, Slone has the flower shop on the next corner. He’s been fighting me for years. Plenty tough customer. Lately he’s been making threats.”\n\n“What kind?”\n\nDavies waved a vague hand. “Says I ruin his business.”\n\nClint murmured deep in his throat. Then he stood up. “I’ll go around and see him.” He put out his hand. Davies took it, gripped it tightly.\n\n“I’m going to try to get down to the shop tomorrow,” the florist said. “Let me know if you find out anything.”\n\nClint grinned crookedly at him. “You’ll know,” he promised.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nYellow Roses\n\nClint parked his car at the curb, and went o the door of “Davies Flowers” and rapped on the glass. Pat came to let him in. She was alone.\n\n“How come you didn’t go home?” Fleming wanted to know.\n\nShe smiled thinly at him. “I’d rather work—it keeps my mind busy. There are a lot of orders to get out. Phone orders.” She jerked her red head at the crowd clustered outside the plate glass windows. “Would they love to come in and stare.” “Probably you can open the store tomorrow,” Clint told her. “But, where is everybody?”\n\n“Herb is out having lunch; Jack is delivering.”\n\n“Look,” Clint asked, “mind if I talk to you?”\n\nShe shook her head and walked back to the counter on which she had been working. She picked up a snapdragon spike and with deft fingers stripped off the leaves.\n\nClint watched her until she had finished the bunch. Then she took the coppery blossoms, put them in a water-filled vase. Her hands stopped as Clint asked slowly, “Was Fred Jensen in love with you?”\n\nShe stood a moment, her red lip caught in her teeth, then she answered, “Yes, I guess he was. I liked him—that was all.”\n\n“And Jack Unger?”\n\nShe turned to him then. “Mr. Davies said that Jack killed Fred because of me?” she demanded.\n\nClint lifted one shoulder. “Could be.”\n\n“I don’t believe it,” she said hotly. “Simmer down—nobody’s accusing him. You like him, huh?”\n\nPat tossed her head. “No,” she said flatly.\n\n“He’s been trying to change your mind—and Fred didn’t like that?”\n\n“Well—” she began, then her voice trailed off. Nervously she picked up a glass bottle, unscrewed the cap, poured two white pellets into her palm and dropped them into the vase that held the snapdragons.\n\n“What’s that?” Clint asked curiously.\n\n“Aspirin. It makes them last longer.”\n\n“As long as three weeks?” Clint’s words were quick. “Or more?”\n\nThe girl looked startled. “I don’t know—” she faltered.\n\nClint leaned toward her, over the counter. “Doesn’t it strike you strange that you have flowers out of season when no one else has?” He pointed to a bowl of yellow roses in the window. “How long have they been there?”\n\nPat followed his motion. “Well, they’re pretty expensive; they haven’t sold.”\n\n“How long?”\n\n“About three and a half weeks.” Clint looked thoughtful. “See you later, chick,” he said abruptly, “I’m going down the street.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nU In Murder\n\nMike Sloan’s store was called “The Patio.” It was smaller than Davies’ flower shop. A small, pasty-faced man came around the counter as Clint entered.\n\n“Can I help you?” he began.\n\n“You Mike Slone?”\n\nThe man bobbed his head. “That’s right.”\n\n“Detective Fleming,” Clint said. “Investigating the murder of Fred Jensen. Did you know him?”\n\nMike Slone swallowed hastily. “Yes, I’d seen him around. Poor boy. I heard—”\n\nClint leaned against a glass case, dug in his pocket, pulled out a crushed package of cigarettes, selected one and lit it. He blew out a cloud of blue smoke and asked, “Know anything about him?”\n\nSlone shook his head hastily. “Seemed like a bright boy. Lots of times I wished he was working for me—but I don’t know anything that would help you.”\n\nClint dragged on his cigarette.\n\n“Davies says you’ve threatened him.”\n\nThe little man’s pale blue eyes widened. “I may have done some talking, but I didn’t mean anything by it, honest! He does a good business, and I guess sometimes I get jealous.”\n\nClint looked thoughtful. “I see.” He shrugged, then, “Well, thanks. I’ll be going—”\n\nClint left the store, got into his car. His eyes were narrowed, speculative. That gilt U—where did it fit? U for Unger, U in Murray, U in murder … .\n\nHe steered his coupe through the traffic over to the West side where Jensen had lived. It was a red- bricked rooming house with a sign, “To Let” in a lower, dirt-smeared window.\n\nThe landlady leaned on her broom and waved him crossly up the stairs when he asked Jensen’s room number. He’d sent Wilson and the fingerprint gang over earlier.\n\nWilson opened the door at Clint’s knock. He grinned at the detective. “Though you’d be showing up soon.” Fleming glanced quickly around. “What you find?”\n\nWilson spread wide hands. “Everything—and nothing.” He waved a hand at the disorder of opened bureau drawers, clothes scattered on the floor, the bed ripped apart. “Place was like this when we came. The door had been forced. Somebody was powerfully anxious to find something—”\n\nClint scarcely heard him, for he had walked a few steps, stooped and picked up a half dozen yellow pencils from the floor. He whistled a thin thread of a tune from between set teeth as he studied them. All the points were well worn down. There were teeth marks at the eraser ends.\n\n“Seems,” he observed half to himself, “that our friend Mr. Jensen did a powerful lot of writing lately. Wonder what?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nGardenia\n\nThe next afternoon Clint Fleming was exactly where he had been the day before—nowhere near a solution. He’d been to see the a solution. He’d been to see the chief —which did nothing for his ego, as Chief Cummings had said he’d better start showing some action, or else. And the “or else” had been punctuated by the slam of a big fist on the top of a desk … .\n\nHe walked into the Davies’ flower store and Pat looked up from some violets she was stemming and came over to him. She looked better today —prettier, if possible. Some color had flowed back into her cheeks; her eyes had lost that reddened look.\n\n“Hello there,” Clint said. He smiled, and Pat smiled back. This was more like it— “Your boss in?” he asked.\n\nThe girl nodded, motioned with her red-curled head toward the balcony that ran half way around the inside of the store.\n\n“He’s up in his office.” She rested quick fingers on his arm. “Have you found out anything?” she asked worriedly. Clint shook his head, and glanced past her to where Herb Martin and Jack Unger were standing. Neither smiled, and Herb’s eyes were chill as they met Clint’s In Unger’s, Clint saw sudden jealousy flare. Strangely, Clint wanted to grin—both those men were jealous of him! Of course, it was no wonder when a girl looked like Pat. …\n\n“See you later, chick,” he told her softly.\n\nHe turned and almost tripped over a flat, wood-slatted crate of roses that lay on the floor behind him. The roses were yellow-red and wrapped tightly in waxed paper. He bent and touched one of the buds with a forefinger—the flowers almost looked artificial.\n\nThen, behind him, someone snapped, “Keep your hands off those flowers!”\n\nHe whirled and stared into the narrowed eyes of Herb Martin.\n\n“Why so touchy, Martin?” he asked quietly.\n\nThe man’s fist curled. “Roses cost money and I don’t want a dumb cop spoiling them—”\n\nClint studied him coolly, then deliberately he bent down, broke off a bud and put it in his buttonhole. He gave it a final pat.\n\n“So?” he suggested.\n\nMartin teetered close, his face dark with anger. Then, with an effort he kept his voice quiet. Over his shoulder he said, “Pat, fix Mr. Fleming a gardenia—he wants a boutonniere.”\n\n“Thanks, I already have one,” Clint told him, and turned and went up the stairs that led to Davies’ office.\n\nDavies was behind his desk. “Hello, Mr. Fleming,” he said. He pulled worriedly at his chin.\n\nClint sat down in a straight-backed chair. “Now,” he began, “have you any idea why Jensen was here, alone, last night? Who closed the store?” Davies leaned back. “He did. I talked to Unger and Martin. They, and Miss Murray left the same time. Fred was going to clean up some things in the basement before he went home. I—” He broke off and stared at the rose in Fleming’s buttonhole. “Where did you get the Talisman?”\n\nClint grinned. “It’s one of yours.” Davies seemed to be waiting for him to say more. Finally he asked slowly, “Martin give it to you?” “No—I took it. Why?”\n\nDavies laughed falsely. “Martin’s very fussy about the roses. They’re sort of his department—” He tapped on his desk top with a pencil.\n\nClint’s eyes were narrowed, watching him. “Yeah,” he said absently. Then he got to his feet. “Well, I’ll be shoving. See you around, Davies.” He went down the stairs and stopped at the counter where Pat was making the wired violets into a corsage. Her fingers were stained from the maidenhair fern.\n\nHe kept his voice low, and for her ears. “Look,” he said. “Take care of yourself—”\n\nHer eyes widened. “Why—what’s the matter?”\n\nHe shrugged briefly. “I don’t know, but there’s plenty. Sometimes I get feelings—and I have one now.” He glanced around the shop. “The answer’s here someplace, if only I could find it—”\n\nAbruptly he drew an order pad toward him and scribbled a number on it. He creased the sheet carefully and dropped it into Pat’s smock pocket. “This is just in case. If you hear anything, or see anything you think I ought to know about—call me.\n\nHe caught Martin watching him, so he bent his head to the rose in his lapel. He took a deep sniff.\n\n“This,” he said, “at least smells good—”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nEmpty Buttonhole\n\nA bell was ringing someplace. For a long time Fleming lay in his bed, his eyes closed, hoping it would go away.\n\nIt didn’t. Finally, with a sigh, he opened his eyes and reached for the alarm clock. His hand stopped half way through the motion—the room was dark. It was still night.\n\nHe sat up suddenly, awake now. He scooped the telephone receiver from its cradle on the nightstand.\n\n“Hello?” he said sharply.\n\nA voice blurred at the other end. An excited voice; a voice shrill. Clint broke into the words.\n\n“Take it easy—I can’t understand you.”\n\n“This is Clint Fleming, isn’t it?” the voice wanted to know. He recognized it, then.\n\n“Oh, it’s you, Pat,” he said quickly. “What’s wrong?”\n\n“Clint—I’ve found out something!”\n\n“Yes? What? Where are you?”\n\n“I’m down at the store. I came back tonight. After you said you thought the answer was here, I decided to look around—”\n\n“Crazy kid!”\n\n“Well, I got to thinking about those Talisman roses. There’s something funny about those crates. I never—”\n\nClint cut her off. “And what did you find?”\n\n“I—” she began.\n\n“Yes—go on.”\n\nThere was no answer. Clint’s hand grew clammy on the receiver. He listened—the phone was dead.\n\n“Pat!” he shouted. Still the fear-starting silence.\n\nIn one motion he had dropped the phone and was reaching for his clothes. There was only one reason why Pat didn’t answer—and that reason sent the blood from his face, leaving him white-lipped, trembling.\n\nHe waited only long enough to pick up his gun.\n\nAs Clint Fleming careened his coupe through the deserted streets he suddenly reached up and felt at his buttonhole. The rose was gone; he had lost it someplace.\n\nMentally he damned himself—he’d had the answer on his lapel and never realized it! But what was the connection ?\n\nHe screeched his car to a stop in front of the darkened flower shop, then he thought of calling the chief. But there wasn’t time for that now —not with Pat in danger.\n\nHe didn’t expect the front door to be unlocked, but it was. It swung open under his hand and he walked into the store, his gun fisted.\n\n“Pat!” he called. “Where are you?”\n\nHis voice echoed back at him, there was no other sound. Just the quiet, cool air, heavy with the scent of flowers.\n\nHe walked softly to the basement door, opened it a crack. A light glimmered up from below, and he heard, now, a feverish rustling. Cautiously he started down the wooden\n\nstairs. The third step creaked under his weight, and abruptly the light winked out.\n\nThat was all—no sound, just the darkness rushing in.\n\nClint stood where he was, poised, listening for the rasp of a foot, anything. There was nothing.\n\nHe inched his wry forward, and again the stairs protested.\n\nThen, shattering the quiet, splitting the darkness, a gun spoke! Clint heard the bullet ricochet from the cement wall scarcely a foot from his head. But now he knew the direction, now he had a target for his gun.\n\nHe pulled the trigger twice, but his aim was wrong. Again the orange flame blossomed, and this time the slug was closer. Too close.\n\nHe plunged down into the darkness, firing as he went, aiming a little to the left of the last flash.\n\nThere was a sharp cry that slipped down scale into a moan—he hadn’t missed that time! He felt for the light switch at the foot of the stairs, flicked it. The shadows fled.\n\nTo the left, by a wooden crate, a man was sprawled. Fleming walked to him, turned him over.\n\nHerb Martin!\n\nA trickle of blood seeped out of his hair where Clint’s bullet had grazed him.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nThe Roses\n\nClint looked at the crate. It was the same one he had seen earlier, only now the waxed-paper-wrapped bundles of roses lay scattered on the cement. He stooped, picked up a bunch. The buds were open—but not naturally—they had been forced open. The very center of the roses were missing. And then Clint saw the little pile of white-powder-filled capsules by Martin’s hand.\n\nThe detective whistled softly. “Dope,” he murmured. “So that’s the answer—they were smuggling dope in the roses. …”\n\nBut that would have to wait. Right now he had something more important to worry about—Pat was still missing.\n\nHe turned, went up the stairs, calling her name, searching the office. If she’s here, he thought, she’d answer—if she could.\n\nBut there was no sign of the girl— she had disappeared completely.\n\nHe was just passing the counter, on his way back downstairs, when his foot caught on something. He reached down and felt it. It was a string—no, it was a ribbon, a long streamer that unwound from the big spool on the counter as he pulled at it.\n\nWhere was the other end? He tugged, the ribbon did not give. He hadn’t been able to find the switch that worked the fluorescent lights, so now he struck a match.\n\nThe ribbon curled away into the gloom, toward the side of the store. Gathering it in his hand he followed it. It stopped at the crack of a small, narrow door.\n\nThen he knew. Pat was inside—in the refrigerator! He jerked open the door. The chill, icy air struck him as he went inside. He groped on the floor. His fingers overturned a vase, sent it crashing. Then he touched a shoulder, a face, soft hair.\n\nHe didn’t breathe as he bent over the girl—was she alive? She was, she stirred slightly and moaned. The other end of the ribbon spool was twisted in her fingers.\n\nHe picked her up gently, whispering her name incoherently, and carried her out into the store. He laid her down. He thought savagely. Where is that damn switch—I have to see!\n\nThis time he found it, and the fluorescence flooded the room. In its soft glow he studied her face anxiously. Then he took a deep breath. She was going to be all right. Just knocked out.\n\nHer eyes fluttered open and she struggled to sit up. Then she clung to him, sobbing.\n\n“It’s all right, darling,” he soothed. “The roses—” she began brokenly.\n\n“It’s all over. I know about them. Martin’s down in the basement, unconscious.”\n\n“Then he—”\n\n“Hush, darling.” He helped her to her feet. “You all right now?”\n\nShe nodded, swaying a little.\n\nClint turned and went to the wall phone. He dialed a number, spoke briefly to the chief. Then he hung up and dialed another number. When a voice answered he said, “Davies— come on down, I’ve found your murderer.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nFresh Flowers\n\nThe cops were already there when the storeowner came hurrying in. His broad face was tense, and he looked as if he had fallen into his clothes.\n\nHe went to where Clint was standing, talking to the chief.\n\n“Who did it?” he demanded. “Was it Unger?”\n\nFleming shook his head slowly. “Davies, did you know that Martin was in the dope smuggling business?”\n\nThe man’s eyes widened and his face paled. “No—” he managed. “You mean, here, in my store?”\n\nClint nodded. “Yes. That was why he didn’t let anyone touch certain crates of roses but himself—”\n\n“And Fred Jensen must have discovered it,” Davies cut in. “And that was why he killed him.”\n\nThe detective shook his head slowly. “That may have been one of the reasons why Jensen had to die—but not the only one. Martin told me before they took him to the hospital. Jensen had discovered a formula for preserving fresh flowers. There’s thousands in such a discovery—”\n\n“Yes. Jensen wanted to patent his formula, which was his right. For that, and because he was getting suspicious—he had to die.”\n\nDavies shook his head bewilderedly. “To think that Martin killed Jensen—”\n\nA faint, hard smile flickered at Fleming’s mouth.\n\n“But he didn’t—”\n\n“You said—well, who did then?” Davies exploded.\n\nClint’s voice was very quiet. “You did, Davies!”\n\n“You’re insane!” The man backed away.\n\n“You’re the one who’s insane,” the detective said relentlessly. “Martin didn’t know actually who killed Jensen any more than I did—until I began to add things up. The flowers lasting longer in your store than anywhere else. The fact that Jensen’s room was searched. That damn U in Jensen’s fingers—I finally tumbled to the fact that the poor kid had been trying to spell out something … and ‘formula’ is about the only word with a u in it that would fit into the picture.\n\n“You wanted the discovery yourself, didn’t you, Davies? You pictured yourself cornering the flower market—”\n\n“It’s a lie!” Davies cut in shrilly. Fleming went on savagely, as if he hadn’t heard. “You didn’t even trust Martin, so you did it yourself—and tried to pin it on Unger. Failing that, you would have let Martin die for the murder you committed. He’ll get plenty on the dope charge—but you, you’re going to get the chair!”\n\nOn his last words, Davies lunged at Clint, his short arms flailing. It was almost pitiful, the ease with which Clint’s rock-hard fist arced up and caught him on the point of his soft jaw.\n\nHe sagged to the floor without a sound, and disappeared under a wave of blue-coated backs.\n\nFleming rubbed skinned knuckles and walked to where Pat was standing, white-faced, her hand to her throat.\n\nHe put out an arm and drew her to him. She stared up at him with wide eyes. “How did you know for sure, Clint?” she whispered shakily.\n\nHe grinned and kissed her on the tip of her tilted nose. “There was one little thing that really set me thinking—those pencils I found in Jensen’s room. They were all badly chewed. And then I saw Davies playing with a chewed pencil. I knew it wasn’t his, that he had picked it up someplace— It might have been coincidence—but it started me thinking.”\n\n“But how did you know it wasn’t Davies’?”\n\nFleming laughed deep in his throat. “A guy with false teeth doesn’t go around biting on pencils, does he?”\n\nThen he looked at Pat a long moment. “How good are you at making bridal bouquets?” he asked suddenly.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because I got a feeling we’re going to be needing one.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n\nIt was very still in the library where Judge Lathrop sat reading. The lamp on the table at his elbow shed a soft circle of light in the center of the room, leaving the outer edges dim and shadowy. The house was quiet. A small clock in the room had already struck one. The Judge&#39;s wife and daughter had been in bed for some hours.\n\nAt last the Judge put down the legal tome and sat thinking over what he had read. He became so lost in meditation that the door at his left was quietly opened and closed without his hearing it. Then a low cough brought him out of his abstraction. He turned and gazed at the intruder.\n\nThe man he saw standing near the door in the semi-darkness was about his own age—that is to say, somewhat over forty years. He was dressed in shabby clothes that seemed a trifle too large for him. A slouch hat was pulled down over his eyes. His right hand was thrust in the side pocket of his coat. Even in that subdued light the gleam of triumph in his eyes was only too apparent. Judge Lathrop stared at him blankly without moving a muscle.\n\n&quot;Well, Judge,&quot; said the man with a short, hard laugh, &quot;can you place me?&quot;\n\n&quot;We&#39;ve met before, then?&quot; asked the Judge calmly.\n\n&quot;Met before? That&#39;s good!&quot; The man chuckled evilly. &quot;You bet your life we met before!&quot;\n\n&quot;Then I beg your pardon. You see, you&#39;re standing in the shadow. If you&#39;d be good enough to turn that switch—&quot; The man eyed him distrustfully.\n\n&quot;None of your tricks, now!&quot;\n\n&quot;The switch is directly behind you. You can find it without turning,&quot; the Judge went on in an even voice.\n\nWithout removing his eyes from Judge Lathrop, the man groped for the switch, found it, and flooded the room with light. Then he pushed his hat back and planted himself brazenly before the Judge, a sneering smile on his lips.\n\n&quot;Maybe you remember me now!&quot;\n\nThe Judge looked him over carefully and coolly and as he turned away his eyes a look of contempt spread over his face.\n\n&quot;Humph! Jack Dodd, I believe you call yourself. A cheap crook, a low-down thief—scum of the earth!&quot;\n\nSudden anger flared up in the man&#39;s eyes.\n\n&quot;You be damned careful what you say!&quot; he said between clenched teeth.\n\n&quot;Five years ago I sentenced you to ten years imprisonment,&quot; continued the Judge, as if he had not heard.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; hissed the man, &quot;and I swore then if I ever got the chance I&#39;d get you—and get you good!&quot;\n\n&quot;I suppose you escaped from jail.&quot;\n\n&quot;You suppose right. And I got these duds—well, never mind where I got them. Hell, we&#39;re wastin&#39; time. I come here to get even with you, you dog!&quot;\n\nThe Judge folded his hands and smiled.\n\n&quot;I hope you brought a revolver.&quot; He spoke anxiously.\n\nThe man stared at him a moment, and then brought an automatic out of his coat pocket.\n\n&quot;I got a gun, all right.&quot;\n\n&quot;And I hope you&#39;re going to kill me,&quot; said the Judge in a lifeless tone.\n\nThis time the man&#39;s jaw dropped a little. It was plain he was puzzled. Then he brought his jaws together grimly.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m here,&quot; he said roughly.\n\nThe Judge looked at the man with a smile of thankfulness on his face.\n\n&quot;Jack Dodd, fate has sent you here at the right moment!&quot;\n\n&quot;Say, what are you driving at?&quot; demanded Jack Dodd uneasily.\n\nThe Judge leaned back in his chair with his chin on his breast.\n\n&quot;I have a nasty, cowardly job on my hands, Mr. Jack Dodd. Now, you can do it for me.&quot;\n\n&quot;Dirty work, eh?&quot; sneered Dodd. &quot;When I&#39;m through with you, you won&#39;t have to worry about that.&quot;\n\n&quot;You promise me that?&quot; said the Judge, looking at him earnestly.\n\n&quot;Cut out the mystery,&quot; snapped Dodd impatiently. &quot;What&#39;s in your bonnet?&quot; Again the Judge dropped his eyes to the rug. There was a pause before he spoke.\n\n&quot;When you entered this room,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;I was on the point of— taking my own life!&quot;\n\n&quot;What?&quot; said Dodd in an astonished whisper.\n\nThe Judge nodded.\n\n&quot;Suicide is always a low thing—a coward&#39;s trick, Dodd. But now I&#39;m saved that. You can kill me, Dodd!&quot; Dodd stared at him, a little taken back.\n\n&quot;You mean you want me to kill you?&quot;\n\n&quot;If you will, Dodd,&quot; answered the Judge pleadingly.\n\nThe other made an impatient movement.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s bunk! Why do you want to pass out? You got everything to live for.&quot;\n\n&quot;Dodd, my son was arrested tonight for embezzlement. Tomorrow the papers will be full of it. My name has never been tarnished before. The disgrace of it will be more than I can bear. I prefer to die rather than face it.&quot;\n\nDodd gave a laugh.\n\n&quot;So the Honorable Judge has a crook in his family! No wonder you ain&#39;t got the nerve to face it. The upright Judge Lathrop, all for law and order, no mercy to criminals! Gripes! That&#39;s the best revenge I&#39;ve heard yet.&quot;\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t, don&#39;t!&quot; moaned the Judge as he hid his face in his hands.\n\n&quot;Go on, suffer! Go on!&quot; chuckled Dodd. &quot;I&#39;m eatin&#39; it up.&quot;\n\nThe Judge suddenly sat up and extended his arms sidewise.\n\n&quot;Shoot me, Dodd!&quot; he begged. &quot;Put an end to it! Dodd, for God&#39;s sake—&quot;\n\n&quot;Shoot you!&quot; laughed Dodd. &quot;I guess not! I got half a mind to stick here and make you face the music. I&#39;d go back and do my bit with a smile on my mug if I could see you dragged in the slime.&quot;\n\nThe Judge&#39;s manner suddenly changed. He flashed a dark look at Dodd.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re afraid to shoot,&quot; he said in sullen anger. &quot;You haven&#39;t got the nerve, you yellow pup!&quot;\n\nThe prison pallor of Dodd&#39;s face went whiter, still. He pressed his lips together, but said nothing.\n\n&quot;You low-livered, degenerate skunk!&quot; the Judge flung at him. &quot;I wish I had given you twenty years.&quot;\n\nDodd&#39;s hand tightened on the automatic. His mouth began to twitch.\n\n&quot;Look out, you—&quot; He ripped out a stinging oath.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s it, Dodd!&quot; cried the Judge. &quot;Shoot! Shoot!&quot;\n\n&quot;So that&#39;s it,&quot; snarled Dodd. &quot;Tryin&#39; to egg me on to shoot, eh? It won&#39;t work, mister. I wouldn&#39;t shoot you now if you called me a dude!&quot;\n\n&quot;Is that final, Dodd? You won&#39;t do as I ask?&quot;\n\n&quot;Surest thing, you know. You&#39;re going to live and get your dose o&#39; misery.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then I&#39;ll do it myself!&quot;\n\nThe Judge turned to the table at his elbow and pulled open the drawer. There in the front of the drawer lay a blued-steel revolver. Dodd, who was watching him narrowly, sprang forward with a cry as he caught sight of it. Before Judge Lathrop could get his hand on the gun in the drawer, Dodd had clapped his own hand, which held the automatic, over it.\n\n&quot;I tell you, you got to live!&quot; he cried, frowning down at the Judge.\n\nThe Judge returned this gaze, and for a second, they measured each other with their eyes. Then, with his eyes still fastened on Dodd, the Judge suddenly gave a mighty push and jammed the table drawer shut. There was a howl of pain from Dodd, and the drawer was deep enough so one could hear the automatic fall on the wood bottom.\n\nThe Judge eased the drawer a trifle, at the same time shoving at Dodd with his foot. Dodd staggered across the room, where he stood wringing his hands in an agony of pain. The Judge quickly opened the drawer, picked up the automatic and covered Dodd with it.\n\n&quot;Jack Dodd,&quot; said the Judge, &quot;the crime for which I sentenced you is one of the filthiest, vilest deeds on the criminal calendar. It will give me great pleasure to return you to your keepers.&quot;\n\n&quot;You—you—&quot;\n\nDodd sputtered. &quot;A trick, a damnable trick!&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, a trick, Dodd. There are other weapons beside firearms.&quot;\n\nDodd&#39;s lips curled back from his teeth with venom. &quot;I hope that son of yours ends in the electric chair!&quot; And then followed a string of vile oaths.\n\n&quot;My dear Dodd,&quot; said the Judge as he took up the receiver to telephone the police, &quot;I have no son.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Mr. Carrington Is Calling\n  Silly Nonsense About Bells\n  A Summons To Someone\n  The Call Was For Me\n  The Shade Signal\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nMr. Carrington Is Calling\n\nIt was Elsa Lloyd&#39;s first experience with death as a nurse at St. Luke&#39;s. She was the youngest graduate at the hospital, slender and frail, with blue eyes that betrayed the strain she had been under despite her brave effort to appear self-possessed. The older nurses had been extremely helpful, not at all resentful that she had been chosen for so important a case, but she had pursued her duties to the very end courageously and competently without requiring any assistance. It was nearly over now. Scofield Carrington was dead, his body was soon to be removed to his home, and she was studying the carefully kept chart of her patient preparatory to turning it over to the head nurse.\n\nShe was seated at a little table in the floor office, the chart before her, using this brief respite after the trying experience of the preceding night to collect herself, when the bell rang softly and the indicator clicked over her head.\n\nElsa Lloyd did not look up. As Carrington&#39;s private nurse she was expected to answer only his summons. But presently she was aware that a floor nurse had entered in answer to the bell and, pausing a moment before the indicator, had come up close to her.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s 42 calling,&quot; said the nurse. &quot;Isn&#39;t that Carrington?&quot;\n\nElsa Lloyd came to her feet quickly, her eyes lifting to the indicator, a little tinge of color coming to her cheeks. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said weakly.\n\nHer lips fell apart, her hand caught the back of the chair from which she had just risen, her eyes still fixed on the little plate showing the numerals &quot;42&quot; on the indicator. Her tired brain could not grapple with the strange situation. Carrington had passed away in the early hours of the morning, and only half an hour before she had left his room, her duties over. And now—the bell.\n\nShe turned at last, question in her eyes.\n\n&quot;Perhaps it&#39;s Dr. Stockbridge,&quot; the nurse ventured.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s in the operating room,&quot; said Elsa quickly.\n\n&quot;Or some one else.&quot; And, seeing the weariness in the young girl&#39;s face, she added: &quot;Shall I answer for you?&quot;\n\n&quot;Thank you. I&#39;ll go.&quot;\n\nShe hurried down the long, silent corridor. She paused at the door, hesitated, then knocked lightly.\n\nThere was no response.\n\nHer hand lowered to the knob. She turned it and the door yielded.\n\nThere was no one in the room. Everything was exactly as she had left it half an hour before: the drawn shades, through which the morning sunlight filtered pale and warm; the stillness of death; and, in the far corner of the huge room, the bed with its rigid, silent occupant.\n\nElsa&#39;s first impulse was to turn and escape, but she checked herself, waited, her back to the door, while the rapid beating of her heart subsided.\n\nPresently she moved toward the bed, slowly, her feet scarcely lifting from the floor.\n\nNothing had been altered, not a wrinkle in the sheet that covered the dead man&#39;s body had been changed. She looked down into his face, observed the strong features, immobile in death, the thin lips firmly locked, the square chin thrust forward, defiant, challenging even now.\n\nScofield Carrington had not wanted to die. The great financier, who had feared nothing, had not feared death. But he had not been ready to go. He had wanted to hold off the hand of death only a little while longer, but it had come relentlessly. And his features still showed the marks of the dead man&#39;s struggle, the unhappiness of his last moments, which had come without the fulfillment of his cherished hope.\n\nElsa&#39;s eyes lifted to the bell that hung from the back of the bed, corded wire with a button at the end, the pressure of which had summoned her so often in the past few weeks to the side of her patient—had summoned her even now to his side. Some hand had touched it within the last few minutes. Whose ?\n\nShe lingered a while, baffled, immobile in the presence of the inexplicable circumstance.\n\n&quot;It must be some mistake,&quot; she said at last.\n\nShe spoke aloud, to reassure herself and to reassure any one who might hear her.\n\nSomehow she felt a vague presence in the room.\n\nShe dared not look about her, and, having spoken, she turned and hurried out of the room.\n\nThe nurse was waiting for her at the office door. She noted the pallor in Elsa&#39;s face, the agitation which her strained features did not conceal. Elsa took the hand she extended, leaning heavily on it.\n\n&quot;Some one has been and gone,&quot; she said in a soothing voice. &quot;You&#39;re unstrung. You ought to—&quot;\n\nShe stopped abruptly.\n\nTheir eyes met and they stood close, neither daring to turn. For the indicator had clicked again!\n\nIt was the elder nurse who first summoned the courage to look, and when their eyes met again Elsa knew what she.had seen.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s 42,&quot; said the elder nurse in a hoarse voice.\n\nElsa&#39;s head lowered, a shudder running down her frame, and her companion led her to a chair, into which the girl dropped heavily.\n\n&quot;Sometimes the indicator gets out of order,&quot; muttered the elder nurse. &quot;It may be that, though I don&#39;t recall its ever happening before. The wires may get crossed—or something.&quot;\n\nHer voice trailed away. She knew that her assurances were unconvincing to Elsa—they were unconvincing to herself. She realized that her usual presence of mind was not at her command.\n\nDisciplined in the shadow of suffering and death, she was aware that, for the first time in her experience, she was confronted by the intrusion of an intangible element which eluded her understanding. Carrington was dead. There was no one in his room. Yet his bell was ringing!\n\n&quot;We ought to report it,&quot; she said at last. &quot;Some one ought to be in the room. It&#39;s—&quot;\n\nShe paused as a young interne entered the office. Her face lighted up hopefully.\n\n&quot;Doctor,&quot; she said, coming toward him, &quot;42 is calling. Won&#39;t you—&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s Carrington&#39;s room, isn&#39;t it?&quot; asked the interne.\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, it&#39;s Miss Lloyd&#39;s case. Why doesn&#39;t she go?&quot;\n\n&quot;She&#39;s just been there. And there&#39;s no one in the room.&quot;\n\n&quot;What?&quot; stammered the interne.\n\n&quot;And that&#39;s the second time the bell has rung.&quot;\n\nMore from the crumpled attitude of Elsa Lloyd in her chair than from the words of the elder nurse the interne gathered the meaning of the strange situation. His eyes were wide with amazement. He looked to the indicator and then turned to the nurse. His lips moved, stirred mutely a moment.\n\n&quot;Does Dr. Stockbridge know?&quot; he asked at last.\n\n&quot;No.&quot;\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll tell him!&quot;\n\nAnd he spun about on his heel and was gone.\n\nThe nurse moved toward the indicator mechanically, her hand lifting slowly and pressing the knob that released the number. The indicator was bare. But scarcely had her arm lowered to her side than a bell tinkled.\n\nIt was 42 again!\n\nElsa Lloyd, her elbows on the little desk, her face buried in her hands, did not look up. She knew from the touch of her companion&#39;s hand on her shoulder what the bell meant.\n\nThe nurse slipped into a chair beside the younger woman. For a long time she was silent; then:\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t understand it,&quot; she muttered, half to herself. &quot;I&#39;ve never had such an experience before. I&#39;ve seen so many deaths, and death was always so final, so completely the—the end. Of course, there&#39;s the soul, the spirit—it&#39;s called by so many names and I&#39;ve heard much nonsense about it. I never believed—few of us do—but every now and then something happens … Like this. What can it mean?&quot;\n\nDespite herself a tremor, half of doubt, half of awe, shook her. She turned to Elsa.\n\n&quot;What do you know about Carrington?&quot; she asked. &quot;You were with him for weeks. Can you think of anything that—&quot;\n\nShe did not complete her question, her thought too unformed for words.\n\n&quot;Was there anything,&quot; she resumed in a moment, &quot;before he died—anything that might explain this?&quot;\n\nElsa sat up, but her head was averted as she spoke.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; she said, her voice low and frail. &quot;But when I was in the room just now, I felt—I seemed to be aware of—&quot;\n\n&quot;Of what?&quot; prompted the elder nurse.\n\n&quot;Something. I don&#39;t know what. As though some one were in the room— besides myself and—and it.&quot;\n\n&quot;The corpse?&quot;\n\nElsa nodded.\n\n&quot;He didn&#39;t want to die,&quot; the girl went on after a while. &quot;There was something between him and his son. You know how unhappy he was about him. He loved him, his only son, and he didn&#39;t want to die feeling that young Carrington hadn&#39;t redeemed himself. You know what a black sheep he&#39;s been. Once I came into the room just after his son had left. The old man had been crying. I think it was that that kept him alive long after we knew his case was hopeless. He told me once he couldn&#39;t die until his son had made good, that his spirit would never rest—&quot;\n\n&quot;His spirit? Did he say that?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes.&quot;\n\nThe elder nurse&#39;s eyes closed slowly and her hands met in her lap.\n\n&quot;Do you think—&quot; began Elsa, leaning forward.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; muttered the elder woman, her voice scarcely audible.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nSilly Nonsense About Bells\n\nBoth women came to their feet as they heard hurried footsteps approaching. The interne entered, a coat flung over his arm.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s coming,&quot; he announced.\n\nDr. Stockbridge entered the office, visibly annoyed and angry, his long fingers busy with the laces of his operating apron, which he was removing. Behind him came, unhurried and calm, Carrington&#39;s lifelong friend and the executor of his will, Madison Dodd.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s this silly nonsense I hear about bells?&quot; the surgeon demanded, slipping into the coat the interne held and advancing toward the women. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you notify me sooner? And why aren&#39;t you in the room to find out what it means, Miss Lloyd?&quot;\n\n&quot;She just came from the room. Dr. Stockbridge,&quot; explained the elder nurse, defending the girl. &quot;There was no one there.&quot;\n\n&quot;This is too absurd,&quot; exploded the surgeon. &quot;I&#39;ve never heard of such a thing. Miss Lloyd should be in that room—&quot;\n\n&quot;She&#39;s had no sleep, doctor, and she&#39;s very tired.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then why don&#39;t you go?&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re afraid. How ridiculous. Well, we&#39;ll have—&quot;\n\nHe turned, but the interne was gone. Dr. Stockbridge frowned. His eyes went toward the indicator.\n\n&quot;When did that bell ring?&quot; he demanded.\n\n&quot;About ten minutes ago. And—&quot;\n\nA bell rang and a faint click came from the indicator. The number &quot;42,&quot; which had not been lowered, vibrated.\n\n&quot;Its been ringing every ten minutes just like that,&quot; said the elder nurse, edging away from the instrument.\n\nDr. Stockbridge frowned. Then, striding across the room, he pressed the knob releasing the number.\n\nHe turned to the nurse.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m going into that room myself,&quot; he said severely, &quot;and we&#39;ll have this nonsense over with. Someone is ringing that bell, and we&#39;ll know who it is. If it rings while I&#39;m there, let me know.&quot;\n\nHe stepped toward the door.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll go with you, doctor,&quot; said Carrington&#39;s friend, speaking for the first time.\n\nThe men walked down the corridor, side by side. The door of Room 42 was closed. Dr. Stockbridge pushed it open impatiently and allowed Dodd to enter first.\n\n&quot;I hope you&#39;ll&#39; forgive this nonsense, Mr. Dodd,&quot; he said, closing the door. &quot;These women—they&#39;re—&quot;\n\nBut Dodd, paying no heed to the doctor, was advancing toward the bed, his face grave. He stopped within a foot of it, looking down on the still form beneath him, his hands clasped behind his back.\n\nDr. Stockbridge looked about the room. Its hospital bareness made it manifest at once that no one could be concealed in it.\n\nIt seemed to him absurd and undignified that he should be engaged in such a futile and meaningless undertaking. He paced up and down, pausing every now and then to observe the immobile figure of Carrington&#39;s friend, wondering what he could be thinking of the whole ridiculous episode. He was a little disturbed that Dodd should take the thing so seriously, treat the matter with silent respect. Once he paused beside him.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m a man of science, Mr. Dodd,&quot; he began. &quot;To me there&#39;s no such thing—&quot;\n\nThere was a light tap on the door and he stopped. He strode to the door and opened it. The interne&#39;s head showed.\n\n&quot;It rang.&quot; the young man said.\n\nDr. Stockbridge&#39;s lips parted in astonishment.\n\nHis hand on the knob, he paused, undecided, looking toward Dodd for some intimation the course to pursue. But Dodd had not stirred, and Stockbridge turned to the youth.\n\n&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said, and closed the door.\n\nFor a moment he was at a loss, but, when he tried to speak, he was silenced by Dodd&#39;s beckoning hand. He approached, stopping at Dodd&#39;s side, his eyes following the other man&#39;s finger.\n\n&quot;I want you to tell me what you see in his face,&quot; said Dodd.\n\nThe request seemed so strange to Dr. Stockbridge that he glanced up quickly to see if Dodd were in earnest. What could he see in a dead man&#39;s face but—death? However, a glance was sufficient to assure him of his companion&#39;s earnestness, and he lowered his eyes. A long moment of silent scrutiny, and then the surgeon bent lower, his eyes narrowing.\n\n&quot;Yes,&quot; he muttered, awed by his discovery. &quot;I see what you mean. It&#39;s amazing. It wasn&#39;t that way when he died—&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you see?&quot; interrupted Dodd.\n\n&quot;The mouth,&quot; said Dr. Stockbridge. &quot;The corners seem to droop more. And the eyelids look more strained. His whole face seems to have changed, as though he were—&quot;\n\n&quot;Dissatisfied?&quot; prompted Dodd, as the surgeon hesitated.\n\n&quot;Yes. As though he were restless and unhappy about something.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ah!&quot; muttered Dodd. &quot;I noticed that when I first came into the room, and. I have been held by it. Dr. Stockbridge,&quot; he added, looking up for the first time, &quot;my old friend is restless, dissatisfied. His spirit is not at peace. And that is why the bell is ringing.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then you think—&quot;\n\n&quot;I am certain. And I have been standing here, wondering what he was distressed about, what message he was trying to convey. He is trying to say something to us, doctor. He is trying to direct our attention to something he wants done. And he will not rest, doctor, until it is done. I must try to understand him. I must find out what he wants.&quot;\n\n&quot;Have you any idea?&quot;\n\n&quot;Perhaps, but I am not sure.&quot;\n\nHe turned.\n\n&quot;Shall we go back to the office?&quot; he asked.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Summons To Someone\n\nWhen they re-entered the office, they found a group of internes and nurses gathered in a corner of the room. The report of the mysterious calls from Room 42 had spread throughout the building, and an awed, silent circle of men and women in hospital uniform were watching the indicator for the call that was momentarily expected. An interne came forward as Dodd and the surgeon entered.\n\n&quot;It rang twice while you were out,&quot; he said. &quot;And young Carrington is here, in the inner office. He was told, and when he heard the bell ring and how the number came up he fainted. He&#39;s lying down in there.&quot;\n\nDr. Stockbridge, followed by Dodd, hurried to the inner office. Elsa Lloyd was bending over a couch, on which lay Edward Carrington, his back to the door. The girl came forward as the men entered.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s better now,&quot; she said.\n\nDr. Stockbridge approached the couch, caught Carrington&#39;s wrist and touched two fingers to his pulse. The youth did not stir, his arm hanging limp in the surgeon&#39;s grasp. Dr. Stockbridge looked up at last and nodded reassuringly to Dodd. Then he turned to the girl.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ll look after him,&quot; he said. &quot;We won&#39;t need you.&quot;\n\nThe girl withdrew.\n\nMadison Dodd retired to the window, and he stood there, his eyes fixed on the horizon, in deep thought. The surgeon came up to him.\n\n&quot;Poor fellow,&quot; he muttered. &quot;I can understand how he&#39;d feel about it.&quot;\n\nDodd did not reply.\n\nOnce more the bell in the outer office rang, the indicator clicked. Dr. Stockbridge turned to observe the effect on the youth. He lay there very still, as though he had not heard; but his eyes, turned to the wall, were wide open. He seemed too stunned for any sensation.\n\nAs the moments fled by, the surgeon grew more and more ill at ease under the strain of the silence and the unsolved mystery. He wondered why they were waiting there, inactive, undecided; and yet, when he tried to think what they could do, he was at a loss. He could not wait there all day, however, obedient to a vague call, an. intangible summons from the dead.\n\nIf only he could persuade Dodd of the absurdity of the whole situation. But how could he convince Dodd when he was himself so completely at sea? He had never believed in these things, had always waved aside any testimony concerning spirits as the invention of gullible minds; yet here before him there was evidence that he could not thrust aside so easily. He paced the room restlessly, finally pausing beside Carrington&#39;s friend.\n\n&quot;What can we do?&quot; he asked.\n\n&quot;I am thinking,&quot; said Dodd quietly, his eyes still on the horizon.\n\n&quot;But,&quot; persisted the surgeon, &quot;do you still believe—?&quot;\n\n&quot;I am sure that the bell is a summons to someone. If you do not understand its message, it is because it is not for you. Perhaps it is not even for me, for I do not seem to grasp the meaning of it. But it is calling to some one here, or it would not ring. And that one will understand if he is here.&quot;\n\n&quot;Still,&quot; pursued the surgeon, encouraged, &quot;even granting the existence of a spirit that exists after death, is it conceivable that that spirit can assert itself in this way? As a man of science, it seems too fanciful to me.&quot;\n\n&quot;What,&quot; replied Dodd, &quot;can be more fanciful than science itself ? It is dumb before the mysteries which it pretends to understand. Can you, as a scientist, explain to me why, when a button is pressed in Room 42, a bell should ring in this room?&quot;\n\n&quot;Electricity—&quot; began the surgeon.\n\n&quot;And what is electricity ? Even science does not pretend to know. Is it not inconceivable that it should be able to flow through a solid copper wire? And yet it does. Man&#39;s soul, his spirit, is more mysterious than electricity. Why can it not flow through the ether and create a disturbance in its environment? Released from the body which it inhabited, why can it not hover near by and make its will known to those it wishes to reach? Scofield Carrington&#39;s body died, but his spirit, refusing to die unsatisfied, is still alive, restless, insistent, urging the fulfillment of its desire that it may be set at peace. And it will not give up until it is satisfied. There,&quot; he added, as the bell rang, &quot;it is still calling. It will continue until he for whom it is meant obeys the call.&quot;\n\n&quot;But who is it for?&quot; asked the surgeon weakly.\n\nMadison Dodd turned slowly, but his eyes did not meet the surgeon&#39;s. They made a circuit of the room and came to pause on the figure of young Carrington, who had stirred for the first time and was now sitting up, his elbows on his knees, his face buried in his hands. The surgeon followed his companion&#39;s gaze. It suddenly came to him that perhaps young Carrington, who had not uttered a word, understood; for he could see that, beneath the surface of his immobility, there was a great struggle going on, that a difficult resolve was forming.\n\nHe turned to Dodd, expecting some revelation from him, but the man&#39;s face was a mask. His fingers were twined in the cord hanging from the window-shade and his eyes were fixed on the youth. The surgeon observed the youth once more.\n\nSlowly Edward Carrington&#39;s hands lowered from his face. Slowly he rose and turned. His eyes were clear. His features were firm. And he came forward with decision in his whole bearing.\n\n&quot;Mr. Dodd,&quot; he said in a slow, level voice, pausing before his father&#39;s friend, &quot;that bell was for me.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Call Was For Me\n\nDr. Stockbridge&#39;s eyes grew wide with amazement at this simple avowal. But Madison Dodd&#39;s expression did not change.\n\n&quot;Well?&quot; he prompted calmly, his fingers still toying with the window-shade cord.\n\n&quot;I have been fighting it out with myself,&quot; said young Carrington, &quot;all morning, ever since father—&quot; He paused, and his lips were unsteady. &quot;You know how unhappy he was over me, my failure to live up to his name. And he died feeling that he had failed to redeem me. But all morning I have felt his nearness. And when I came in here and they told me—when I heard the bell and saw the call from his room—I knew. The call was for me. I understood what he wanted me to do. I obey.&quot;\n\nHe came forward a step and his hand went to his breast pocket. When it came forth, it held a long envelope.\n\n&quot;This is it,&quot; he said, handing the envelope to Dodd. &quot;It is father&#39;s will. It leaves me without a penny, as he said it would. I have deserved nothing better.&quot;\n\nThe shade flew up with a bang as Madison Dodd released the cord and extended his hand for the envelope, heavily sealed, and addressed to him. Slowly he put his gold-rimmed pince-nez to his nose and then he thrust his finger under the flap of the envelope to tear it open. But he paused and looked up as he heard a low murmur in the outer office. Dr. Stockbridge looked up too.\n\nNurses and internes were whispering excitedly to each other, their eyes on the clock. The surgeon followed their glance, and then he understood the meaning of their agitation. The minute hand was pointing to the half-hour. The bell should have rung, as it had rung every ten minutes all morning with unfailing precision. It had not rung. The hushed excitement of the uniformed men and women grew in intensity as a minute passed and still the bell was not heard. Two minutes passed. Three minutes … .\n\nDr. Stockbridge turned to Madison Dodd. Carrington&#39;s friend stood near the window, a sheaf of legal papers, evidently the will, in one hand, a typewritten sheet in the other. He was reading this, and he looked up as the surgeon came toward him. He waved his arm in the direction of the outer office.\n\n&quot;Send them away, doctor,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Carrington&#39;s summons has been answered.&quot;\n\nOne by one the nurses and internes filed out of the office in obedience to Dr. Stockbridge&#39;s gesture of dismissal. When they were gone, the surgeon returned to the side of Madison Dodd.\n\n&quot;You&#39;ll understand when I read this,&quot; said Dodd.\n\nHe adjusted his glasses and brought the typewritten sheet closer.\n\n&quot;This is my last test for Ed,&quot; he read. &quot;If he gives this envelope to you, as I instructed him, then my original will stands as it is, leaving all to him. When I gave my boy this envelope, I told him it contained a new will, disowning him and leaving him without a penny. If he has enough manhood to give this to you, then I shall know that he has repented and that he has the courage to take his punishment manfully. In that case, he will prove himself a true Carrington and will deserve the fortune that comes to him. This is exactly as we planned it, old friend. My prayer is that he will make good. My spirit shall not rest until he does. And I trust that my everlasting peace will not be disturbed by my boy&#39;s craven failure to deliver this message to you.\n\nScofield Carrington.&quot;\n\nMadison Dodd looked up, his fingers folding the sheet he had just read.\n\n&quot;Scofield Carrington&#39;s spirit is at peace now,&quot; he said, in a solemn voice.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Shade Signal\n\nThe men&#39;s hands met at the door. It was a silent clasp. Dr. Stockbridge&#39;s lips pursed and his eyes lowered.\n\n&quot;Mr. Dodd,&#39;&#39; he said, &quot;this is the first experience of the kind I&#39;ve ever had. As a man of science—&quot;\n\n&quot;My dear doctor,&quot; broke in his companion, &quot;science is still in its infancy. Some day it may be able to explain many things that are still beyond understanding.&quot;\n\nHe nodded and turned on his heel. There was a smile on his face, but Dr. Stockbridge did not see this.\n\n&quot;Basement,&quot; said Dodd to the elevator man, as the car shot downward.\n\nEmerging from the cage, Dodd hurried down the dimly lighted corridor. He paused before a door over which there was a neatly printed sign &quot;Electrician.&quot;\n\nA man in overalls rose as Dodd entered, touching his cap.\n\n&quot;Did I get that shade signal right?&quot; he asked with a smile.\n\n&quot;Perfectly,&quot; said Dodd, drawing a banknote from his wallet and crushing it into the man&#39;s hand. &quot;And now you may rearrange those wires. You did splendidly. Thank you.&quot;\n\nThe man touched his cap, and Madison Dodd, nodding, passed out of the room.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

The chill had reddened Vance Corey&#39;s oversized nose and ears, and his tall, spare frame shivered frequently within the thin folds of his topcoat. He eyed enviously the heavy ulster draping the short, rotund form of his partner. Mose McCluskey would be wearing a heavy ulster—the heel!\n\nCorey made queer, sniffling noises with his nose, and glanced at his watch. Eight p.m. Four more hours of moping. Four more long hours of prowling around a down-at-heel business section. Phooie!\n\nCorey presently grated: &quot;Say, Mose, how about guzzling a cup of jamok? I got chills.&quot;\n\nMose McCluskey, comfortable in his heavy ulster, snickered. His round, florid face assumed an expression of mock commiseration.\n\n&quot;I sympathize with you,&quot; he said. &quot;I really do. But according to the rules and regulations …&quot; He paused abruptly as several muffled reports sounded.\n\nThe detectives looked questioningly at each other.\n\n&quot;Auto backfire?&quot; said McCluskey. Corey shrugged his shoulders. Their eyes swept the fronts of the small shops lining each side of the street. Mostly pawnshops and men&#39;s cheap clothing stores. Nothing unusual was evident.\n\nThey were about to continue their strolling when a shout drew their attention to a patrolman fifty paces ahead. The officer was facing one of the shops, his service pistol ready.\n\n&quot;Drop it!&quot; cried the patrolman to someone within the entrance of the place, a small pawnshop. The next instant his gun barked, and he lunged forward to disappear into the shop. The two detectives broke into a full run, unlimbering their service pistols.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Pawnshop\n\nAs they approached the pawnshop&#39;s entrance a fusillade sounded within—then silence. The door was wide and the interior dimly lit. With trigger finger tense, Corey bent low and dashed inside. McCluskey followed suit.\n\nJust within the door Corey stopped, a lurid curse on his lips. His narrowed eyes gleamed savagely as they darted about the room. Not a thing moved in the semi-darkness.\n\n&quot;Damn!&quot; breathed McCluskey, now at his elbow. They both looked at two crumpled forms sprawled motionless at their feet. McCluskey bent forward.\n\n&quot;Both goners,&quot; he rasped the next moment. &quot;Donnelly through the left eye, the old Jew with at least three in the chest.&quot;\n\nCorey was about to speak when a faint, distant squeak tensed their fingers. Somewhere a door was being opened cautiously. Corey immediately placed the sound as coming from the rear. He hurdled the still forms on the floor and raced in that direction.\n\nThe rear door was reached through a small stockroom. Corey swore lustily as he nearly lost his footing near the door, which was open. A glance downward showed his path strewn with rings and other trinkets of jewelry. The bandit-killer had dropped his loot in flight. The thought catapulted Corey through the door and into a dingy little court.\n\nCorey halted and looked about him. The court was boxed on three sides by a high board fence, on the fourth by the wall of a neighboring building. At first glance the court seemed empty, but on closer scrutiny of its shadowy confines Corey flung up his pistol. Climbing the fence at his right was a man.\n\n&quot;Halt!&quot; shouted Corey, but his quarry squirmed to the fence top. Corey fired, then cursed. He had been a fraction of a second too late. The fugitive had dropped out of sight on the other side of the fence.\n\nCorey sprang toward the fence, McCluskey at his heels. Corey&#39;s tall form shot to the fence top and over. He alighted in a narrow areaway between two apartment buildings. A faint blur moved at the far end of the areaway. Corey ran hard toward the blur. Behind him, puffing and muttering invectives, McCluskey dropped from the fence top and waddled in his wake at a surprising speed.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Trio\n\nCorey&#39;s pistol spoke twice. But he knew he had missed. The next instant the blur darted from the areaway into Cocaine Alley. A hundred yards in length, narrow and unpaved and unlighted. Cocaine Alley was a notorious spot in a disreputable district.\n\nAs Corey turned into Cocaine Alley the killer was but fifty paces ahead and more clearly discernible. At that instant the fugitive made a flinging motion with his right arm. A faint clunk came to Corey&#39;s ears and his long, lean legs began to work like pistons. The killer had discarded his gun.\n\nBut before Corey could appreciably close the distance between himself and his quarry, the man swerved to his left and vanished into the shadows of a row of small, ramshackle cottages.\n\nWhen Corey reached the spot where the man had vanished he halted and peered into the gloom. He stood before a wretched little dwelling. There was no sign of the killer. He sped to the rear of the cottage. No one there, either. He returned to the front to meet a barrage of questions. McCluskey, wheezing like a winded truck horse, had arrived on the scene.\n\n&quot;Nail him? Where is he? Ugh! Didn&#39;t lose him?&quot;\n\nCorey searched his vocabulary for a choice oath, found none and spat in deep disgust.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s ducked into this joint, or I miss my guess,&quot; he said, jerking a thumb toward the cottage. &quot;Sammy Mondell&#39;s scatter.&quot;\n\nMcCluskey grimaced. The abode of Sammy Mondell, self-styled King of Cocaine Alley, was well known as a favorite hangout of dope peddlers—human vultures who profited from the sale of illicit narcotics to unfortunate addicts but wisely shied from using the stuff themselves.\n\n&quot;You take the back,&quot; Corey barked suddenly. &quot;I&#39;ll take the front. If the mug&#39;s in there, maybe we can flush him.&quot;\n\nAs McCluskey started for the rear Corey approached the cottage&#39;s front door, pistol ready in hand. He tried the knob. The door was unlocked. He opened it and entered.\n\nHe found himself in a well-lighted, sparsely furnished room. Three men were within the room, seated about a table in the room center and apparently engrossed in piecing together a jigsaw puzzle. They studiously ignored the presence of their visitor.\n\nCorey&#39;s shrewd eyes swept the trio. A tall, lanky, swart-featured man in shirt sleeves he knew as Sammy Mondell. Across from Mondell sat hunched in his chair &quot;Mugsy&quot; Lawton, small, slender and rat-faced. The third man was Louis Mink, short, stocky, pleasant featured behind horned-rimmed eyeglasses that lent him a harmless look. Corey eyed Mink hard. He knew the harmless looking one as a petty grifter with a burning ambition to become an underworld big shot.\n\nCorey grinned as he noted Mink fumble in placing a puzzle piece in place. At that moment McCluskey came lunging into the room from the rear. Corey snapped at the trio at the table:\n\n&quot;Hey, you mugs! A little attention.&quot;\n\nThe trio stared casually in the direction of the detectives, their faces expressionless. Corey chortled harshly.\n\n&quot;Anybody besides us come in here during the past couple of minutes?&quot; he brusquely demanded.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Puzzle\n\nThere was a brief silence, then Sammy Mondell said softly: &quot;No.&quot; And simultaneously the three resumed their puzzle piecing. McCluskey muttered an oath and started toward the men, but Corey caught his sleeve and unobtrusively pulled him toward the door. McCluskey found himself led from the cottage and, with mingled puzzlement and anger, heard Corey call out to those within as he closed the door, &quot;Sorry to have annoyed you boys.&quot;\n\nThe cottage door closed, McCluskey growled: &quot;Say, what the hell&#39;s your game? Why not run them mugs in and put the screws to them? They&#39;ll spill their guts quick.&quot;\n\nCorey shook his head. &quot;They ain&#39;t cokies—they are tough babies.&quot; He paused, then added unexpectedly: &quot;Anyway, I know who the guilty character is. So shut up and follow me.&quot;\n\nCorey led the now thoroughly baffled McCluskey to the spot where he had seen the killer discard his gun in flight. After a brief search they discovered a Colt .45 automatic pistol beside a garbage can. Corey realized that the gun&#39;s striking the can had caused the clunk he had heard.\n\nMcCluskey started to pick the gun up but Corey stayed his hand. &quot;Leave it be, Mose. It&#39;s undoubtedly empty and I want it left there.&quot;\n\nMcCluskey grumbled: &quot;Damn! You&#39;re acting like one of them guys you read about in stories. What&#39;s up your sleeve?&quot;\n\n&quot;Follow me,&quot; said Corey for the second time. And grinned. McCluskey consigned his partner&#39;s soul to the Devil and reluctantly followed.\n\nCorey didn&#39;t go far. Only to a large ash heap beyond the garbage can. Behind this they crouched, quite safe from discovery by anyone passing along Cocaine Alley.\n\n&quot;Who you expecting?&quot; said McCluskey irritably. &quot;The mug who threw away that gun?&quot;\n\nCorey nodded.\n\n&quot;Know who it&#39;ll be?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah. Louie Mink.&quot;\n\nMcCluskey swore. &quot;Then why the hell didn&#39;t you nab the rat in Mondell&#39;s joint? He&#39;ll mope plenty fast now.&quot;\n\n&quot;He won&#39;t mope,&quot; replied Corey. &quot;At least I&#39;m betting he don&#39;t. Could have nailed him in the cottage, but we ain&#39;t got no evidence that he&#39;s the killer. Remember, it&#39;s quite certain that only Donnelly and the old Jew saw the killer—and they can&#39;t witness anything now. Besides, there ain&#39;t no fingerprints on that automatic over there.&quot;\n\n&quot;How do you know that?&quot;\n\n&quot;Louie Mink had a pair of gloves in his lap when I saw him last.&quot;\n\nMcCluskey sighed deeply. &quot;One of us is nuts. Me, I&#39;d a-nabbed that Mink character and looked into his mind down at Headquarters.&quot;\n\n&quot;No go,&quot; said Corey. &quot;Mink is hard people. He wouldn&#39;t talk—especially on himself. I&#39;m betting heavy on this gun angle. He&#39;ll show—wait and see.&quot;\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nPatience Rewarded\n\nBut Louie Mink didn&#39;t show during the following hour, nor did anyone else. McCluskey took to growling softly. Corey could sympathize with him. Their crouching positions behind the ash heap were muscle cramping and the cold was growing intense as the night deepened. Doubt of the worth of his strategy began to assail Corey.\n\nThen it happened. The crunching of approaching feet sounded. The figures of the two detectives tensed and their hands tightened about the butts of their service pistols. Cautiously Corey peered over the top of the ash heap. The figure of a man was silhouetted against the gloom near the garbage can.\n\nThe next instant Corey straightened from his crouch. He sprang catlike toward the man by the can.\n\n&quot;Put &#39;em up. Mink—high!&quot;\n\nThe man whirled with a startled oath, the dim moonlight revealing a bespectacled, hate-contorted face. It was Louie Mink. As his hands raised slowly skyward his right hand made a sudden, snapping motion. Corey ducked, barely avoiding being struck squarely in the face with a heavy-calibered automatic pistol, then closed with Mink as he was rushed. They tussled violently for a moment, then Mink suddenly slumped to the ground to lay an inert heap. McCluskey had tapped him rather ungently with the butt of his service pistol.\n\nStraightening his disarrayed attire, Corey eyed the fallen man grimly and said:\n\n&quot;He&#39;ll burn sure, now. That gun of his will clinch matters when the ballistic experts get in their work.&quot;\n\nMcCluskey grunted. &quot;Yeah, but what&#39;s got me stumped is how you figured this rat as the killer right off the bat.&quot;\n\nCorey chuckled. &quot;Wasn&#39;t hard. When I barged into Mondell&#39;s scatter I was certain that the killer would be the last man who had entered before me. Well, I found out quickly who that man was. It was Mink. I noted that he was having much difficulty in fitting a piece of jigsaw puzzle into its proper place. He wasn&#39;t drunk or unusually nervous, either. He just couldn&#39;t see plain. There was steam on his glasses. He had come out of the cold night into the warmth of the cottage&#39;s interior and his glasses steamed up instantly. They hadn&#39;t time to uncloud before I barged in.&quot;\n\nMcCluskey grunted again. He looked down at the fallen killer, who was stirring slightly with the slow return of consciousness.\n\n&quot;He&#39;ll burn, all right,&quot; said McCluskey heavily. &quot;Steamed glasses and all—even if that won&#39;t help a couple of widows and a swarm of kids.&quot;\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

The room was small and done in faded blue draperies upon which were tinsel stars and moons.\n\nThe one window that overlooked Sixth Avenue bore the name of the astrologer in porcelain letters and the information that her hours of business were from two o’clock to five daily. A broad table that stood in the center of the room held a plaster skull and a quantity of astrological charts. Other charts were nailed up on either side of a door that led into an anteroom. The low ceiling had once been painted to give the impression of drifting clouds. Twin gas jets, blackening it, had long past destroyed the effect. The faint though pungent odor of gin hung on the stirless air.\n\nThe owner of the astrology parlor sat at the center table. Madame Sovio wore a flowing Egyptian kimono patterned extravagantly with the mystic signs of the zodiac. She was old, gaunt and unprepossessing. Her untidy hair was wreathed with a greasy veil; her shrewd eyes focused on the financial page of a morning newspaper. From time to time she stimulated herself with small quantities of fluid poured from a square bottle convenient to her elbow.\n\nMadame Sovio finished a perusal of the page she read and was turning languidly to the front sheet of the paper when she looked up. The door of the outer room had opened and closed. With the practice born of long experience she placed both bottle and newspaper in a lower drawer of the table, thrust a few cloves into her toothless mouth, and stood up.\n\nThe “waiting room” of the establishment was even smaller than the inner room. It contained nothing save a number of rickety chairs and a red-faced youth who was pinching out a cigarette ere consigning the stub to a coat pocket.\n\nThe caller was tall, bulky and unattractive. He wore a rusty brown suit and stained yellow brogans with bumpy toes. A celluloid collar held a stringy purple cravat; from under the sagging peak of a shoddy cap a low, protruding forehead, dark, crafty eyes and a loose, rapacious mouth were visible.\n\nIt was evident to Madame Sovio that the youth was flotsam cast up by the turgid rivers of subterranea.\n\nHe met her gaze and shuffled forward.\n\n“You the one that slides out the dope on what’s gonna happen?”\n\nThe woman inclined her head.\n\n“Yes. Come in.”\n\nThe visitor stepped into the room hung with the faded blue draperies. Madame Sovio closed the door after him. She indicated he should take the chair opposite her across the table.\n\n“Do you wish a horoscope or a reading?” she inquired as he sat down.\n\nHe stared.\n\n“A spinner on the docks give me the gab that you had steered him straight on the bang-tails. I’m due to gay-cat tonight on something important. I want a frame telling me how my luck is gonna break.”\n\nMadame Sovio twined her claw fingers together. She understood the youth to mean that some client who had sought her advice as to making bets on the races had recommended him to her.\n\n“The stars,” she began, following a usual procedure, “plan and compel! Their influence falls directly on each mortal. What is planned cannot be changed. A man’s planetary destiny is as inflexible as Fate. It is Fate. I charge one dollar for a reading.”\n\nThe red-faced youth produced a crumpled dollar and pushed it across the table.\n\n“Give me the dope on how I’m gonna make out. Am I gonna be lucky or not ? Get the hop working and give me a buzz. Should I or shouldn’t I?”\n\nThe seamy lips of the astrologer came together.\n\n“What is your name?” she asked in a business-like voice. “What is the date of your birth? Upon what hour of that day or night were you born? I must know these things before I read the messages of the heavenly bodies.”\n\nThe youth continued to stare at her for a long minute. He muttered the name of Joe Carney, informed her of the date of his natal day and, without hesitation, said he had been born at the precise hour of midnight.\n\nMadame Sovio became engrossed in a deep study of her charts.\n\nWhile she bent her gray-crowned head over the table Joe Carney settled back in his chair. He glanced about idly and wrinkled his nose at the familiar odor of gin that could not be disguised by the perfume of the cloves. He sat patiently until a slight exclamation moved his eyes to the woman across the table. He was surprised to see she was staring at a chart with every indication of horror. r\n\n“Not one hour of the twenty-four is propitious! The day is ill-omened! All the planetary influences are dark and evil. Mars, Saturn, Uranus and Mercury are adverse. Jupiter is in a hostile position and is ringed with red. This is the star that guides your footsteps through this constellation. Its scarlet rim foretells but one thing.”\n\nJoe Carney met her gaze.\n\n“What’s that?”\n\nMadame Sovio moved her hand slightly.\n\n“Murder!” she said quietly. “At midnight you came upon this earth and at midnight the stars plan you shall be removed from it. Uranus intrudes and blurs the horoscope. I can read no further. That is all.”\n\nJoe Carney laughed harshly.\n\n“The hell it is! I pay a dollar for that song and dance? Give me the money back. You’re a robber!”\n\nMadame Sovio pushed the dirty bill he had laid on the table across to him.\n\n“Take it! It will bring you no good. You are in the shadow.”\n\nThe red-faced youth pocketed his money, shrugged with contempt and slouched out, banging the door after him. For an interval the woman sat motionless, fingers picking at the thumb-marked chart before her.\n\n“The red ring,” she said half-aloud. “Blood on the stars—murder on earth—”\n\nEmerging onto Sixth Avenue, from the narrow entrance of the building housing the two rooms of the star-reader, Joe Carney laughed under his breath.\n\n“A hell of a spiel!” he said to himself. “I should get glomed for a bone to get that bunk dished out. The old dame is nuts.”\n\nHe crossed to the west side of Sixth Avenue and walked north. A firm believer in the Black Arts, he wished he had not listened to the dock-walloper who had told him of the astrologer. He could have interviewed a palmist or crystal-gazer and not wasted his time. He knew nothing, and now it was too late to seek another seer. Within twenty minutes he had an appointment with Stanley Ray, the leader of the Duster Band; final plans for the night’s adventures were to be unfolded to him.\n\nIn sight of the shopping district Carney entered a side street. He put a number of avenues behind him, passed under the scaffolding of an overhead railroad and presently was on the threshold of the small area of the city, controlled by Stanley Ray’s band of thugs and gangsters. Tenement houses stood shoulder to shoulder in flanks of brick. Down the slope of the side street an avenue where freight cars rolled was visible; further distant was the waterfront and the Hudson River. Frowsy women leaned from countless windows; children played in the gutters; the summer air was dank with the stench of salt water.\n\nInto the avenue where the freight trains ran Joe Carney stepped. He put two blocks behind him and presently came upon a waterfront hotel—a building that had been old when the city was young. Joe Carney passed through the hostelry’s yawning front door and moved into a small lobby. A few loafers, smoking nauseous pipes, played checkers silently or slumbered loudly, shaggy heads tilted forward on flannelled chests.\n\nApart from the group, brooding over his cigarette, sat a tall, heavily built young man with a dark, sinister face in which was largely written both determination and courage. This man stood up as Carney entered, nodded his head slightly and opened a white-washed door a few feet back from where he had been sitting. When Carney had followed him into a small room that was used as a refuge for drug-peddlers and their victims, he closed the door and turned the key.\n\nJoe Carney promptly sat down.\n\n“Well, I’m here.”\n\nStanley Ray inclined his head slightly.\n\n“So I see.” He pulled up a chair and\n\ndropped into it. “Listen carefully. I’m passing you the word that you turn the job on Tenth Avenue tonight. I’ve never told you where you’re to go or what you’ve to do. All that you know is you’ve been picked out by me to swing a deal and keep your peep closed. The frame is set so that all you have to do is to walk in, help yourself and walk out. A half-wit could turn this without a mistake. That’s how soft it is.”\n\nJoe Carney fished in his pocket for the half-consumed cigarette. He lighted it and inhaled deeply.\n\n“I make you. Let’s have it all.”\n\nStanley Ray went to the door and listened. He returned to his chair and leaned forward. He lowered his voice.\n\n“Limping Lou has turned straight— by request. He works for the gas company. Tuesday he went to a flat on Tenth Avenue to read the cellar meter. In the front basement of the place are two rooms rented by a woman called Mrs. Garber. Lou had finished reading the meter and was passing out when he heard a clinking noise. It came from inside Mrs. Garber’s front room. Lou tried to look through the keyhole, but it was plugged. So he went out into the alley and found the side window of the same room. This window was protected by bars, but was open at the top. Lou found a barrel, stood up on it and looked through the top of it.”\n\nJoe Carney drew a breath.\n\n“What did he see?”\n\nStanley Ray leaned still closer.\n\n“He saw Mrs. Garber sitting before a trunk—counting money! Lou said she was tying up bales of the green stuff in old aprons. He watched her until she put the aprons in the trunk, filled it to the top with old clothes and then shut it up! That’s what he saw!”\n\nJoe Carney dropped his cigarette to the floor and ground it out with his heel.\n\n“What else?”\n\n“I stuck a plant up there,” Stanley Ray resumed. “I found out this Mrs. Garber is out every afternoon. She makes her money playing the stock market. It’s no use trying to get into the room during the day because the janitor of the building and a bunch of ginnies are laying pipe in the cellar. I sent the Turk up yesterday. He took a fall out of the bars. He filed them to the bone. A couple of pulls will yank them out. The window’s always open and you can go in over the top of it.”\n\nJoe Carney lifted his head.\n\n“What time do I go in? Will the miser be there when I get to the trunk ? How much long change do I get out of this?”\n\nThe leader of the Duster Band favored Carney with a direct, cold stare.\n\n“You get what I give you! Have you anything to say about it?”\n\nBefore the bland stare of the gangster king Joe Carney’s eyes wavered and fell.\n\n“Nothing,” he said hastily. “Put me right on it!”\n\nStanley Ray smiled faintly.\n\n“I found out this Mrs. Garber gets telephone calls from Levy’s Drug Store. At a quarter of twelve I’ll telephone the drug store and tell them to send for Mrs. Garber. They’ll shoot their kike kid over to the basement. You’ll be in the alley at quarter of twelve. When she goes out you go in. I’ll stall her on the wire as long as possible. It should take you just about ten minutes to grab the dough and exit. Do you get me?”\n\nJoe Carney reflectively rubbed his beard-rusty chin.\n\n“Yes,” he said laconically.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Right Dope\n\nThe night was hot and unstirring. A full moon rode high in a cloudless sky. The dank smell of the river grew more pronounced. The streets were lined with coatless loungers sprawling at ease in doorway or on stoop.\n\nJoe Carney, shuffling up Tenth Avenue, searched each store window for a clock to tell the hour by. It could not be very late. The avenue was well filled’ —a number of shops were open and doing business. Again he regretted some prophet had not been employed to prognosticate the fortunes attending the enterprise. In every task he had set out to accomplish he had been warned in advance as to the condition of his luck. If he had been told it was not favorable lie had postponed the event. And never once had he been apprehended.\n\nHe walked on, hands rammed in the pockets of his coat. He eyed the numbers of the buildings as he passed them, still searching for a clock, growing aware his destination must be only a few blocks distant. He saw the moon creep up over the sullen rooftops and perceived the canopy of brightly shining stars. He thought of the astrologer of the early afternoon and the jumble of her words.\n\n“A murder!” he chuckled, touching the automatic revolver hung under his left arm. “Swell chancel”\n\nTwo more blocks traversed, he came abreast the building in whose basement the wealthy Mrs. Garber resided. And at the same minute his eyes fell upon the face of a clock in a store of the tenement and he started.\n\nThe hands of the clock pointed to five minutes of the midnight hour!\n\nGuiltily realizing he had been delinquent and heedless of time, Carney descended a number of steps that led down into the basement. He found himself in a cement-lined passageway. He followed it to its termination and found himself in the clothesline-hung backyard in the rear of the building. An alley ran into the backyard, presided over by a lean cat. Carney removed the animal from his path with a toe of his boot and crouched against the face of the alley’s brick wall, ceasing to curse the vivid moonlight only when a barred window of translucent glass leaped out to meet him.\n\nA tingle of anticipation ran through Joe Carney. Hex found the same barrel Limping Lou had made his observations from and wheeled it close to the window. He mounted it cautiously and applied an ear to the aperture in the window’s top. All was quiet within. Obviously, he decided, Mrs. Garber was in the drug store or on her way to it. He was ten minutes late and would have to work rapidly.\n\nThe window bars yielded instantly to his grasp. He tore them roughly away, one by one. When the last bar had been wrenched loose, Carney pressed the top half of the window lower and poked a head into the inky blackness of the room. Low but distinctly he heard the monotonous ticking of a clock.\n\nSatisfied that no menace crouched in the gloom, Carney threw a leg over the sash and lowered himself into the room.\n\nUntil his eyes could grow accustomed to the murk he stood motionless. A faint odor of gin assailed his nostrils. Faint stirrings tuned his nerves to a high pitch. With a sense of direction fixed firmly in mind, he crept forward. The treasure chest, Stanley Ray had told him, rested to the right, against the room’s north wall. As the thought flashed through his mind, his knees came in contact with some low-set object. His outstretched hands clasped the top of something he knew immediately was the trunk, and he exhaled a breath of relief.\n\nThe cover of the trunk swung upward at his touch. He felt to make sure that the connecting arms were firmly fastened and delved into a mass of soft garments, placed layer upon layer. These he dug out and flung to the floor, burrowing, mole-like, to reach the apron-wrapped treasure. The scent of gin seemed to envelop him. He wondered why this odor should stir odd recollections—recollections he could not piece together.\n\nHe had pulled the last article of clothing from the trunk when the door of the room vibrated with a sudden staccato rapping. Ere its first echoes throbbed into silence, a nasal voice sup–planted the loud knocks with an insistent statement:\n\n“Mrs. Garber! Somebody wants you on the telephone down at Levy’s!” Joe Carney’s hands closed convulsively. The clock he had looked upon had been fast or the telephone had marred Stanley Ray’s message!\n\nIn either case, Mrs. Garber must be within a few feet of him!\n\nThe messenger from the drug store began his rapping again. Stiff as stone Joe Carney sought to think. Then, as the knocks ceased for the moment, he heard, from some quarter close at hand, the creak of a bed, a soft footfall—a sibilant swish that told of a garment being donned. Followed at once the rasp of an opening door. A vagrant air current, stirred to new action, touched Carney’s forehead—cold against the sweat that had gathered upon it.\n\nBreathless questions rushed through the mind of the intruder. Should he allow the woman to answer the messenger? Or should he strike before she reached the door?\n\nAnother series of footfalls wheeled him silently about. Someone was approaching—had stepped through the door. He thought he could detect a muffled shape of shadow moving closer to him. The suspense of waiting was agony. A breath caressed his hot face and a hand touched his arm. Someone gasped.\n\nAt the same moment he sprang forward.\n\nWith a low growl he felt his fingers dig deep into a soft, stringy throat. Eyes glared into his own; for all of the fact she was a woman, the figure he clutched fought desperately, Carney released his left hand to bring it down with crushing force on the jaw of the struggling figure. Before he had crashed it savagely into the upturned face the woman managed to wrench a scream from between her lips.\n\nCursing, Carney struck again. He gripped the throat again with the hand he had used with hammer force and shook the woman as a terrier shakes a rat. As if from a distance he heard fresh raps falling upon the door—the voice of the messenger:\n\n“Mrs. Garber! Mrs. Garber!”\n\nThen silence.\n\nCarney relaxed the gripping pressure of his death-working fingers. He found he was talking but knew not what he said. He had killed a woman, but it was her own fault. Hot blood pounded within him—rage and a gloating satisfaction. He felt that at that moment he wished she possessed the nine lives of the cat he had kicked from his path. He would strangle each from her.\n\nAnd then he realized the apron-wrapped loot would never be his if he stood longer, clutching the limp figure. He opened his hands. The body slumped to the floor. The moon, swinging around, entered the alley and crept into the room, lighting it up like a pale arc lamp. Carney looked down at the huddle of his victim.\n\nThe woman had fallen on her back. Her face was upturned to him— wreathed with a horrible, fixed grin. He stared, fascinated, eying, too, greasy gray hair that seemed strangely familiar. For a full watch-tick he stared, rigid. The odor of gin—the gray hair—the gaunt face, painted with the ghastly moon glare. All at once knowledge flooded him.\n\nMrs. Garber wore the face of the Madame Sovio who had read the stars for him that afternoon in the Sixth Avenue room!\n\n“Murder!” Carney whispered. “She had the right dope!”\n\nSomething, as he straightened up, stopped the flow of the incoming moonlight. He raised his eyes and turned them to the window. His gaze flashed and fell upon a helmeted head looking in over the lowered top of the translucent window. His right hand darted under his jacket and gripped his automatic. In some blind, dizzy fashion he managed to drag it out.\n\nBut before he could pull the trigger the yellow glare of an electric torch smote him directly between the eyes. A voice, curt and imperious, bade him throw up his hands. Carney, blinking like an owl drenched in sunshine, fell back. His weapon crept up to firing position.\n\nThen the heavy silence was shattered by the sound of six shots, so rapidly fired that they merged as one.\n\nThe automatic fell from Carney’s hand. He wondered vaguely if he had been shot—why his legs seemed to be melting away. Cursing again, his brain reeled and scintillated with sparks. He groaned and fell heavily across something softly yielding … .\n\nThe clock that had ticked monotonously whirred and struck the hour of twelve.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Already Dead\n  The Living And The Dead\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nAlready Dead\n\nTennant stopped outside the door of his wife&#39;s room and went over the details of his plan for the last time. The thing was so absurdly simple that he wondered why he had not thought of it months before. There was not the least chance of a failure. He had only to plant the idea in her diseased brain and she, with the cunning that all maniacs possess, would do the rest.\n\nEveryone knew her suicidal mania. It had been brought out at the time of the hearing. No blame could possibly be attached to him for her death. Had not the nurse frustrated her in half a dozen different attempts? Damn that fool nurse anyway! She had too exalted an idea of the importance of her position.\n\nBut, after all, it was, possibly, a good thing that she had been so vigilant. People couldn&#39;t say that it was carelessness, then. He smiled to himself as he recalled the kind things their friends had said when he refused to send his wife to an asylum after the court had pronounced her insane. They imagined that it was his great love that made him keep her with him. It was laughable how easily people could be fooled. How were they to know that he had made a careful investigation and found that too close a watch was kept on the inmates of such institutions? There was a better chance of her making a successful attempt right here at home. Accidents are always liable to happen in private houses; in public institutions people are paid to guard against such things.\n\nCurse the fool law that prohibited a man getting a divorce from an insane wife. Such laws made a criminal of a person. Otherwise, he could have married Helen a year ago. He must guard against his love for her being found out. It might cause someone to cast suspicion his way.\n\nOf course, they would never be able to confirm their conjectures. But his position in the community was too high to have even the finger of scorn pointed in his direction. It would never do for a deacon in the church and a prominent professional man to let people know that he was guilty of evil, even in thought.\n\nNo, he must keep away from Helen until he had shown the proper amount of respect for his deceased wife—for he had begun to think of her as already dead! After a period of hypocritical mourning, they could be quietly married—and he would still retain the love and respect of his fellow townsmen. Of course it meant several months&#39; waiting. It would be hard—but they would have the rest of their lives together—and both of them were young.\n\nAnd there was the matter of Grace&#39;s inheritance to be considered, too. Good thing they had never had a child. It would be all his now—that is, after the proper formalities had been gone through. Naturally, he would erect an expensive headstone to her memory and give her an elaborate funeral. Some people measured a man&#39;s love for his wife by the amount of money he spent on her funeral.\n\nYes, the scheme was simply Machiavellian in its magnitude, and, with the requisite amount of attention paid to the detail&#39;s, there was not the least bit of danger.\n\nHe turned the knob and entered the room. With a tender kiss for the woman with lusterless eyes, who sat mumbling to herself in the low wicker chair, nervously picking at the folds of her dress, he turned to the middle-aged woman in nurse&#39;s garb who sat in the window near by.\n\n&quot;Better take an hour&#39;s walk, Miss Gorman,&quot; he said kindly. &quot;You look fagged out. I&#39;ll look after Mrs. Tennant until you return.&quot;\n\nThe nurse arose wearily.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s awfully kind of you, Mr. Tennant. I am tired. She&#39;s been bad again today,&quot; she ended, significantly.\n\nTennant&#39;s face took on a worried look.\n\n&quot;She&#39;ll probably settle down again in an hour or so,&quot; he responded. &quot;I&#39;ve a little work to do—I can do it just as well in the other room and still keep an eye on my poor little girl. There&#39;s nothing around that she can get hold of, is there?&quot;\n\nHe settled himself in a chair beside his wife and patted her white hand affectionately. With a tear in her kindly Irish eyes for the little, unostentatious display of love, Miss Gorman left the room and, a minute later, Tennant, from his place in the window, saw her swinging down the street.\n\nThe time was at hand.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Living And The Dead\n\nPressing his wife&#39;s hand tightly between his own, Tennant addressed her in the tone one uses in talking to a little child.\n\n&quot;I&#39;ve often wondered,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;why you didn&#39;t commit suicide, Grace? Of course, I know that you&#39;ve tried it, but your methods have been all wrong. Do you understand what I am getting at? I want to help you.&quot;\n\nHe looked at the woman keenly. He imagined that her dull eyes took on an added brightness—that she was not plucking at the hem of her dress so nervously. He hurried on:\n\n&quot;Now, I&#39;m going to show you how to do it, sweetheart. Then, when the nurse is out of the room, some day, for a few minutes, you can put one over on her. It&#39;ll be a good joke on her. won&#39;t it? Come on, and I&#39;ll show you how to do it.&quot;\n\nApathetically she arose and followed him across the floor to where the big, old-fashioned bed stood in the distant corner.\n\n&quot;Now, watch me, dearie, and see how I do it,&quot; he continued. &quot;The nurse thinks that she&#39;s got you cheated by removing everything that you might use—but we&#39;ll show her, won&#39;t we?&quot;\n\nHe removed the light counterpane from the bed and twisted it into a rope. &quot;See, girlie, how it&#39;s done? Just the right size to hang one&#39;s self with, isn&#39;t it? Now, then, we carry this chair across the room and put it under this chandelier. Get the idea?&quot;\n\nThe demented woman made no answer. But Tennant knew that her suicidal mania was attracted by the scheme—that the seed planted in her brain was already sprouting. She followed close behind him, her dull, impassive eyes watching his every move.\n\nHe stepped upon the chair and attached the improvised rope to the chandelier.\n\n&quot;See how easy it is, dear?&quot; he went on. &quot;Now, next, we make a noose in the rope, like this—see? It&#39;s just as easy as rolling off a log. Then we put the noose over our head and pull it up tightly about our neck. Understand, now? All that&#39;s left is to kick the chair out from underneath—and the devil and all couldn&#39;t keep a person from choking to death, could he?&quot;\n\nFrom his height atop the chair, he looked down upon the woman.\n\nShe was gazing up at him, fascinated, her eyes burning brighter now.\n\n&quot;The idea pleases you, doesn&#39;t it, sweetheart?&quot; he smiled.\n\nShe nodded understandingly.\n\nThen, suddenly, she made a leap for the chair and tore it from beneath his feet! With a frightened yell, the man dropped to the end of the rope, his toes almost—but not quite—touching the floor.\n\nThe maniac stepped back with a shrill little cry of delight and watched him gyrate and whirl as the improvised rope twisted and untwisted itself. His mouth was open. His eyes bulged from their sockets! His tongue stuck out oddly. His breath came gurglingly, sobbingly, gaspingly. His face grew black and mottled. His legs and arms danced about curiously, twitchingly … .\n\nHis peculiar antics filled her with delight. She forgot her depression in her new-found happiness. He was teaching her some new game. She clapped her hands together and shouted for more. And when he hung quiet, she seized him by the legs and swung him to and fro, yelling joyously. And thus the nurse found them—the living and the dead—an hour later when she returned from her walk.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

That has something to do with breeding and background, I’m told. I wouldn’t know.\n\n“Mr. Keogh,” he said in a flat voice, “I have reason to believe my daughter killed a man last night. You were recommended to me by an associate as resourceful and discreet, and I want you to—”\n\nI stood and reached for my hat.\n\n“No,” I said.\n\n“I tell you—”\n\nI shook my head. “I said no, and I’m getting out of here before you tell the test of it, because you’ll only be sorry you spilled it, and you’ll get to worrying what I’d do about it, and I think you have enough on your mind.\n\nAnd that goes for me too, in I started for the door, but he me again. He was a whale of a desk slapper.\n\n“Mr. Keogh,” he said harshly, “if my daughter has committed a crime, I shall be the first to insist she stand trial for it. I will not attempt to hide it from the police. I will not …”\n\nHe went on for quite a while in this civic-minded strain, but it drew me back to the chair beside the desk, even if I wasn’t convinced.\n\n“You know, Mr. Rutherford,” I said when he ran down, “ this wouldn’t sound so much like the speech you gave the Kiwanis boys last week If you had called the police before you got me in. Maybe I’m fat and forty and look dumb, but I’m sales-proof. Why didn’t you call the police?”\n\n“Because, man, I’m not sure! I merely said I had reason—\n\n“Okay, okay. Who’d she shoot?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Where did it happen?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Wow! Maybe you know how or why it happened?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Brother,” I said, “you don’t want a detective, you want a crystal gazer. Didn’t she spill anything?”\n\n“My daughter is in no condition to talk. She was hysterical when she came in at five this morning, and the doctor I summoned said she is temporarily deranged because of shock.” He had a tight rein on himself, but it was too tight and his hands were beginning to shake. “But there was blood on her dress—and not her own blood— and there was a fired revolver in her purse. That’s all I know.”\n\nHe closed his eyes and his hands lay limply on the desk before him. I felt sorry for him, but not too sorry, because I didn’t trust him. I still thought he was trying to get me to pull back the neck his daughter didn’t have sense enough not to stick out.\n\n“And where do I come in?” I asked, just to be talking.\n\nHe took a deep breath. “Somewhere, perhaps, a man is lying dead with six bullets in him. I want you to find that man before the police do.”\n\n“And then?”\n\n“I want you to protect my daughter’s interests.”\n\nI stood up again and this time put my hat on. “Ah hell,” I said, “maybe you didn’t hear me the first time.”\n\nBut he went right on talking in a monotone, as if I hadn’t spoken at all. “I want you to find anything that can be used in her defense if she goes to trial. I want you to get there first because the police won’t be interested in defending a—a murderer, and they will overlook the things that may save her life.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nBlue Chip\n\nI took my hat off again. It was an old hat and could stand it.\n\n“Why are you so sure they’ll connect her with it at all?” I asked.\n\n“Because she went out last night wearing a sable cape and returned without it.”\n\n“And if it hadn’t been for the cape, would you still have called me?”\n\nYou could have cut throats with the look he gave me, but he didn’t answer. We were finished playing games and now it was take it or leave it, so I took it.\n\n“I’m going to soak you for this.” I gave it to him straight. “I’ll cost you five grand, win, lose or draw, in advance—and I still don’t like it.”\n\n“Cash or check?” he snapped.\n\n“Cash.”\n\nHe unlocked the top drawer of his desk and counted out five bills from an envelope. I didn’t hold them up to the light.\n\n“And now,” he said in that frigidaire voice of his, “I think we’ve wasted enough time.”\n\n“Right. Let’s take a look at that dress and the gun.”\n\n“They’re upstairs in my room.” As my eyebrows went up, he added sharply, “I didn’t want the doctor to see them, damn it!”\n\nAs we stepped into the hall, a young man who looked like the sort of son Men of Distinction usually have, came clattering down the stairs whistling a little blues song. He couldn’t have been very blue, for he greeted his father with a big, lopsided grin.\n\n“Hi, Dad,” he said. “Sorry about rolling in stinko at six ayem. It must have been that wild oat I ate last night.”\n\n“That’s all right, son. You’d better get your breakfast.”\n\nThe kid made a face and put his hand to his stomach, but he clattered on by and turned into a room that could have been a kitchen.\n\n“Is he wise?” I asked.\n\n“He knows nothing about it. I’ve postponed telling him, until … I didn’t want to upset him. He’s in charge of the purchasing department.” There was a strong note of pride in his voice. “As you probably know, I control the North American Distilling Company.”\n\n“Yeah,” I said, “I looked you up before I came.”\n\nHe went the rest of the way to his room, and he opened a closet and dragged out a white evening gown that was cut simply enough not to have cost more than two or three hundred. Right down the front was a big brown smear, as if someone had tried to grab her and had slid off. He unwrapped a cheap, nickel-plated .38 from a handkerchief and handed it to me, still in the handkerchief.\n\n“Somebody got it, all right,” I said. “You can’t fire all six unless you fire straight up in the air, and that blood didn’t come from a bird. Let’s see her purse.”\n\nHe handed me a little jewelled thing that must have been a bargain at Tiffany’s, and I emptied it on the bed.\n\nAmong the usual woman stuff was a blue poker chip and seventeen nickels. I picked up the chip. It had a scotch terrier embossed in the center of it.\n\n“That’s her lucky piece,” he said. “She always carries it. I don’t see—”\n\n“Why is it her lucky piece?”\n\n“She won rather a large amount of money gambling one night. She kept the chip out of her winnings.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“I don’t know. Where does one usually gamble? At a gambling house, I suppose.” He didn’t sound like a loving father. He just sounded bitter.\n\nI let it pass and said, “Here’s a funny thing. A girl doesn’t deck herself in all these pretties just to go for a walk all alone in the park. Who was the guy?”\n\n“Carroll Dennis, controller at the distillery. He didn’t come home with her. He was not at home when I called.”\n\n“Why would she want to shoot him?”\n\nThat seemed to surprise him. “Shoot him! Good God, man, they were engaged to be married.”\n\n“There are worse motives.”\n\nHe said good “God, man” a couple more times, but the idea seemed to shake him up. While he was getting used to it, I picked up a pair of white satin evening slippers and gave them a going over, inside and out. Aside from a green smear that peeled right off, there was nothing except an I. Miller label, and I couldn’t hold that against them.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nHopheads\n\nThe scream came with the intensity of a calliope. I was bending over, putting the shoes back on the floor, and gave my head a ringing crack against the mahogany highboy, but old man Rutherford seemed to know all about it, for he turned and galloped down the hall like an arthritic stork.\n\nI was right behind him when he pranced into the room at the head of the stairs.\n\nIf deranged meant screwy, his daughter had it; she looked nutty enough to feed a family of squirrels. A rawboned nurse was struggling to get her back to bed but wasn’t getting very far, because the girl’s not having any clothes on didn’t make her any easier to handle.\n\nBut suddenly she stopped writhing and with graceful movements of her arms began to sing, “Come to me my melancholy baby, cuddle up and don’t be blue, all your fears … .” She hung on fears for a quavering instant before her face snapped into a mask of pure terror. She wrenched herself away from the nurse and leaped under the covers and lay there trembling so hard you could hear it. Then she passed out. The nurse, breathing hard, arranged her comfortably on the pillows.\n\nI stepped quickly to the bed and looked her arms over for pinpricks. There was one on the right arm, high up, that the doctor must have given her, but I didn’t have time for much more, for Rutherford grabbed me by the shoulder and butted and pushed me across the room.\n\n“You leave your hands off her!” he shouted furiously. He looked as if he were going to hit me, but most of that was because I had barged in and saw his daughter naked.\n\nI don’t like being pushed around so I gave it to him as rough as I could. “I’ve seen hopheads act like that, and I wanted to be sure.”\n\nThat cured the parental ire. “Hopheads!” he gasped.\n\nThen the nurse lit into me and yelled if I didn’t know the difference between a poor girl who was suffering from shock, at least she did and so did the doctor, and Rutherford started waving his fingers under my nose, so I said, “Nuts! Let’s get on the phone. I got some calls.”\n\nHe followed me downstairs, still yapping his head off, but I paid no attention. I scooped up the phone and started calling all the cab companies in the book, because if she came home by taxi maybe they could tell us where they picked her up, and that would be something to go on. I didn’t expect to get very far, and I didn’t; they had to check with their night drivers, so I said I’d call them back. I had Rutherford try to get Carroll Dennis again, but there was no answer. He looked discouraged.\n\n“We’re not getting anywhere,” he said desperately. “I’m paying …”\n\n“Yeah, and you’ll get your money’s worth before we’re finished. Where’d they go last night?”\n\n“They went to dinner. I don’t know where.”\n\n“Where’d they usually go?”\n\nHe shook his head helplessly and made a few motions with his hands.\n\nSo I said, “Okay. Did they have anything to say before they left that might be a hint?”\n\nHe wrestled with that for awhile and at last got it down. “She came into the room and said ‘Heil Hitler. I’m strictly from hunger, but I know a coal pile where we can really stoke up.’” He looked anxiously at me, “Is that any help?”\n\nHis eyes kept going to his wristwatch, and he kept trying not to look.\n\n“There ain’t no such place,” I told him, “Not these days. Wait a minute! I take that back. The smorgasbord place out on the highway, the Stockholm, or something like that. And it’s close enough.”\n\n“I’ll get my car.”\n\nI said, “No. I’m going alone.”\n\nA stubborn look, came in his face and he said quietly, “I’m going with you.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThat Shipment Of Rum\n\nI’m kind of pig-headed and I might have argued it out, but young Rutherford stuck his head in the doorway and said, “Hi, Dad. I’m leaving now. Can I drive you anywhere?”\n\nRutherford said, “Well … ” and looked at me.\n\nI shrugged. “We’ll drive down and get my jalopy. He can take us.”\n\nHe took us. We didn’t say much on the way.\n\nThe old man broke the silence once and said mildly, “You should call Tommy and tell him why you weren’t at the apartment last night.”\n\n“I told him last evening, Dad. I wanted to talk to you about that shipment of rum we’re taking in today. I called you last night, but you weren’t in. Now here’s what I wanted—”\n\n“Later, son.”\n\nAnd that was all. Young Rutherford whistled his little blues tune, and if I’d had my zither I would have accompanied him. I hate rides with three in a roadster, unless the fourth is blonde and on my lap.\n\nAs we got out at my garage, Rutherford said in mild reproof, “You should have your car cleaned, son. It’s like a sandpit underfoot.”\n\nYoung Rutherford flashed his grin. “Today, Dad. A promise. I’ll be up for dinner tonight. Right?”\n\n“Yes, son.” Very affectionate.\n\nAnd that should show you what interesting people you meet in my profession.\n\nWe drew a bull’s eye at the Stockholm. I gave them a quick flash of my badge that didn’t say Police, and they were very helpful. Yes, Miss Rutherford had been in last night. They knew her very well, they were glad to say. Was there any trouble? They were glad there wasn’t. Yes, of course, the waiter. He’d be free in a moment, if the gentlemen wouldn’t mind … . Too glad to be of assistance. Too glad.\n\nThe waiter was Swedish and sounded it, but you’ll have to use your imagination because I’m no good in the dialects. He stood up very straight with his hands at the seams of his pants and made his report in that singsong the Swedes have.\n\n“Miss Rutherford and her escort had table three. They first had smorgasbord. Then the young lady ordered frog legs with …\n\n“That’s the cook’s department. What’d they talk about?”\n\n“I did not overhear, sir. The young lady was very gay, but the young man was sad. He did not smile. There was not much conversation during dinner. Just before they left she seemed to be urging the young man to go somewhere with her. She said, heads we do, tails we don’t. Then she tossed something in the air like a coin and said, heads.”\n\nI pulled out the blue chip. It was the same on both sides.\n\n“Was this what she tossed?” I asked and flipped it like a coin for him. With people like that, you have to keep it simple.\n\nHe stood stiffly at attention and watched it. He didn’t bat an eyelash. “I couldn’t say, sir,” he said after he had given it all the attention he seemed to think I expected. “I wasn’t watching very closely. Is that all, sir?”\n\n“That’s all, Sergeant. I’ll recommend you for promotion at reveille.”\n\nHe turned on his heel and marched out. He didn’t salute.\n\nI stopped in the phone booth in the lobby and called the cab companies again. Four of them hadn’t carried Miss Rutherford last night, but would be glad to do so in the future and guaranteed fast, prompt service. The others hadn’t contacted their night drivers and where could they contact me?\n\n“I’ll contact you,” I said. “Thanks.”\n\nI made for the car and Rutherford stuck to me like tar to a fender.\n\n“We’ll chase down that blue chip,” I told him. “It’s a cinch that’s what she was flipping, so it must have been on her mind. She wouldn’t toss her compact, and it wasn’t any of the seventeen nickels or the waiter would have said so. Why seventeen?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nBuy A Fish For A Quacking Cat\n\nThere were a lot of roll-em-and-weep joints along the highway, but all of them didn’t go in for the kind of swank that went with blue chips and ladies in sable wraps. Four that I knew of between here and Trenton—the Midway, the Coq d’Or, the Black and White and McMahon’s. Of course it might not have been any of these, but it sounded reasonable, and I couldn’t see anyone driving thirty miles to the city just to watch a little man rake in your dough when the wheel stopped. Not with the gas shortage.\n\nWe hit the Midway first and bellied up to the bar for a rye apiece. The barkeep was bored and sloppy and didn’t seem to care if he hit the glasses or not.\n\nRutherford’s eyes snapped, but before he could open his mouth I said quickly, “Quiet this time of day.”\n\nThe barkeep said, “Yeah. Chaser?” While he fumbled around with the glasses, a white cat jumped up on the stool beside me, looked into my face and said “Quack,” then it said “Quack” again. I looked at the barkeep and he was grinning.\n\n“Everybody jumps when she says that.” He was friendly now. “It’s her throat. She’s been like that ever since she tangled with the fox terrier down the way. She wants you to buy her a fish. They’re a dime.”\n\nI spun a dime on the bar and he came up with a fish a little bigger than a minnow. He saw the way I looked.\n\n“It ain’t every day you can buy a fish for a quacking cat,” he said defensively, then he grinned. “It’s the boss’s idea, but it’s still a riffle. Hell, for a dime she ought to lay an egg, too.”\n\nWe finished our drinks and I tossed the blue chip on the bar. He picked it up and looked at both sides, then looked at me.\n\n“What’s that for?”\n\n“A blue chip. Worth ten bucks.”\n\n“Not to me, it ain’t. Ours have a monogram and you can’t spend them over the bar. The drinks are a buck.”\n\nNow if you had had a Sears Roebuck badge and a Dick Tracy education you could have done better than that, but I’m fat and forty and try to get by the easy way and sometimes I get careless, like with the chip. I should have known right away a joint called the Black and White would have a scotch terrier on their chips, and I should have known, after the way he acted, the bar-keep’d call them up with a tip-off. Maybe I’ve lived too long, even, in cash.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA Knockout\n\nWe skipped the Coq d’Or and went straight to the Black and White, but they were waiting for us—a committee of two. The barkeep wasn’t behind the bar when we walked in; he was at the end, talking to a tall thin man with a face you could use to peel potatoes. They jumped us when we walked past. The barkeep handed me one on the side the head, then while I was still groggy he grabbed me by the back of the neck and rush me toward the open door. Just before he heaved, I reached back for his wrist and rolled forward. He dived straight over my head and took up a couple feet of the oyster shell driveway with his face.\n\nI let him have a couple high on the cheek as he scrambled to his feet, then kicked his legs from under him and put a rabbit on the back of his neck that laid him down for good.\n\nI sprinted back into the bar, but I could have saved my legs, for the old man was doing all right. Skinny was backed into the corner of the bar and the wall and was holding his wrist and howling and trying to duck each time Rutherford jabbed at him with his fountain pen. I pushed the old man aside and slammed the guy in the belly, then put everything I had right on the button. His head hit the wall like a tom-tom and he slid down and sat on the floor with his head on his chest. He was strictly a punk. I reached down and jerked the pen point out of his wrist and handed it back to Rutherford.\n\n“Here’s your nib, pop,” I said. “You ought to go home.”\n\nHe shook his head stubbornly, so I gave him the phone numbers of the cab companies and told him to call up again.\n\nI dragged the barkeep back into the room and sloshed him with water. His face looked like what happens to your leg when you slide into third base. I slapped him a few times and he came around.\n\n“Look,” I said, “maybe you needed the exercise, but otherwise I don’t get it.”\n\n“Nuts to you, snoop,” he said.\n\nHe gingerly patted his face with the towel I handed him from the bar, and looked at the blood as if he didn’t believe it.\n\n“Pal,” I told him, “I don’t know what your angle is, but we’re looking for the old guy’s daughter. He thinks she eloped but he ain’t sure, and he doesn’t want to call up Missing Persons if she’s going to turn up with orange blossoms from Hoboken, because the newspapers’ll go haw haw and he’s a big executive and lost his sense of humor when he was promoted. Now if you still want to box, just get up and we’ll go a few more rounds.”\n\nHe said “Crisake!” and went behind the bar and poured two drinks. “What’d she look like?” he asked.\n\n“Tall, blonde, white evening dress, sable cape, a knockout.”\n\nHe kept nodding as I spoke. “Yeah, yeah, yeah,” he said, “But I didn’t see her when she first come in. She didn’t show at the bar till late. She’d picked up a couple C’s on the wheel and must have been celebrating inside, because she had a heluva bag on. She was with two guys and kept calling one of them Fred, which wasn’t his name. It looked like she was supposed to know this other guy, not Fred, but she didn’t, and the guys got a laugh out of that. Then she started yelling for clams, but we don’t serve sea fish, but this other guy, the one without a name, said he knew a place and they went out. And if you could have seen them carry her out, she wasn’t doing no eloping. She’s in some guy’s apartment, sleeping it off.”\n\n“Seems as if. What’d these two guys look like?”\n\n“Hell, guys in a tuxedo lode alike to me. Dames dress different. It’s like a uniform, the guys.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nSeventeen Nickels\n\nI didn’t get my hunch until old man Rutherford came back from the phone with that funny look on his face and said there was nothing doing from the cab companies. It was like turning a corner and meeting a friend. I threw the whisky down and didn’t even taste it.\n\n“Thanks, pal,” I said to the barkeep, and grabbed Rutherford’s arm and hustled him out.\n\nA hundred yards down the highway, I swung the jalopy into the old shore road and opened it up. About a half hour in I took the north prong of the fork and kept the pedal down. This stretch, when it hit the shore, was pretty desolate since the hurricane cleaned out most of the summer shacks, but there was a little joint out there, hardly bigger than a dog wagon, that used to get quite a play from the sea food lovers. The new highway had turned that trade south.\n\nThe joint was still there, but it had that barren look an unlived-in place gets. I cleaned a peephole on the window and peered in. There was a lot of dust, but there was a tiny bar with some plates on it and a half empty whiskey bottle, and on the shelf behind it in front of the mirror was another bottle of whiskey, a small keg and a telephone. In the left corner was a jukebox. It looked screwy, but I knew I was right.\n\n“The seventeen nickels,” I said.\n\nI turned away from the window and started trotting down the road that led to what used to be a fishing village. The fishermen’s shacks had gone with the wind, and the big weighing-in house was all that was left. For a road to a deserted village, this one had a lot of tire marks, and a lot of them from heavy trucks.\n\nThe old man was doing his best to keep up with me, but I was running pretty hard, because I wanted to get it over.\n\nIf the body hadn’t been there I actually would have been disappointed; but it was, lying on its face close to the water, and beyond it in the dry sand was something that looked like a dog, stretched out and sleeping. I turned the corpse over. He had taken one of the six shots through the hand, as if he had put his arm up to protect himself. The other five were in the face and chest, and it wasn’t a picture I’d want to carry around in a locket. I heard a stifled gasp behind me and looked up into the old man’s ashy face.\n\n“It’s Dennis,” he moaned. His chest jerked a couple of times. He was going to be sick.\n\n“Take a look at it,” I said savagely, “Take a damn good look.”\n\nI strode over to the sable cape that looked like a dog, and as I bent over, something went Slap!, and I dived for the sand. It went Slap, Slap again, and I guess the only thing that saved me was that the guy was shooting downhill from the dunes and I was lying flat. But the old man was standing and at the next slap, he twisted around and fell. I had mine out by this time and sent a few quick ones at the rim of the dunes that must have sounded dangerous, for after a few minutes I heard a car roaring away but fast. By the time I had floundered to the top of the dunes there was nothing there but a road that curved out of sight almost immediately in the scrub pine.\n\nI ran back to the old man. He had got it in the shoulder, but it wasn’t too bad, and after I tore up his shirt and wound it around, it stopped bleeding. I helped him up, and with a little assistance he could walk.\n\n“A drink’ll fix you up till we get a doctor,” I told him.\n\nI kicked in the flimsy door of the clam joint and propped him against the bar before I went around back.\n\n“Whiskey?” I said, “Or some of this stuff in the keg, whatever it is?” Something Spanish was burnt into the wood.\n\n“It’s rum, and furthermore it’s smuggled. There aren’t any revenue stamps on it. Give me some whiskey.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nA Good Deep Breath Of The Clean Fresh Air\n\nI got the cops on the phone and told them about the body and the old man being shot and I was taking him home. I put down the phone slowly. They had told me someone had just called up about the body. This case was beginning to stink.\n\nThey were at the house when we got there, and so was young Rutherford, for his car was parked at the side. It was dinner time, and later than I thought. They were all in the big living room that overlooked the garden. The two detectives were talking together at the window, and young Rutherford was leafing through a magazine, whistling his little blues song. He looked up and grinned.\n\n“That’s a pretty tune,” I said, “Let’s see, it goes, ‘Come to me my melancholy baby, cuddle up and don’t be blue.’ I heard your sister sing it this morning. Now what could there be about a little tune like that that’d scare the pants off her?”\n\nHe stopped turning pages and his grin froze.\n\n“And what about that body at the shore, and the seaweed on her white shoe and all that sand in your car today—the car she drove home, and you had to come by taxi”—the old man jumped when I said that “—and pretend you were drunk, just so you could explain your car being here. Or did you want to keep an eye on her just in case she hadn’t been too drunk to see you shoot Dennis? How did you feel when she escaped in your car and left you stranded? You planned that for her, didn’t you?”\n\nHe was trying to sneer, but his face wouldn’t stay put because the muscles were making movements of their own. I gave it to him as hard as I could before he could get himself together.\n\n“It’ll be easy to prove,” I said. “We’ll just get her fingerprints from the wheel and call in the cabbie who drove you up. And Dennis got his because he started asking pointed questions about the smuggled rum you were selling to the distillery’s bottling plant. There must have been some pretty funny looking endorsements on those checks that came back from non-existent companies, and to an auditor that must have been as suspicious as hell. You kept your smuggled rum in that weighing house in the old fishing village, didn’t you? It’ll be easy to prove, anyway. There must have been a nice piece of change in that for you—the difference between what you paid for it and what the distillery paid, because there’s no tax on smuggled rum.\n\n“While we’re getting the prints from your car, we’ll look up those checks and let you explain them. And we’ll get the barkeep from the Black and White to identify you as the guy who wasn’t Fred.\n\n“Boy, you’re a dilly. You tried to frame your sister for murder, and tried to cut down your old man and me at the shore, and all in twenty-four hours … Look out! ”\n\nI sprang for the desk. He had a gun under the magazine and the bullets ripped up the floor. The barrage that followed came from the two dicks at the window, and they tore him to pieces, for there was a hell of a lot of blood—all he had, it looked. But the madhouse didn’t stop there.\n\nThe shots started her off again and there was one shriek after another from upstairs, then a scramble on the stairs and she came charging into the room, still stark naked, her eyes rolled up in her head, her hair flying. She must have been as blind as a bat, for she ran smack into the wall and knocked herself out. One of the dicks gladly helped the nurse roll her up in a blanket and carry her out.\n\nI turned to the old man and said, “Well, there’s your five grand worth. But tell me’ something. When you found out from the cab company it was your son they carried, what were you going to do—let your daughter fry, or just have her stuck in the nut house as a homicidal maniac?”\n\nHe worked his mouth like a goldfish, took a tottering step toward me and reeled and fell across a chair and slid to the floor. I looked at the other dick and he shook his head and made a face.\n\nI put on my hat and walked out of the house. I stood for a minute on the porch and took a good deep breath of the clean fresh air as if I had never tasted anything like it before.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

It was a foolish thing to do, for the harbor was full of ground sharks, but the heat and rather too much rum-and-sugar had made me reckless. Probably, too, I had imbibed some of the devil-may-care spirit of this ancient nesting place of the buccaneers.\n\nWhen I reached the dock I was dizzy and blown from my exertions. It was terribly hot. Something seemed dragging at the nape of my neck, and the winking lights in Port Royal harbor looked like the blazing eyes of mammoth animals. I sat down on a cask, and watched the red lantern on the Mary Rose’s stack disappear into the night. I couldn’t quite recall why I had come back to Port Royal. It was because of something someone had told me—damn that rum! My head was like an empty barrel. I could not remember a thing.\n\nAfter a bit I lit my pipe, having tobacco and matches safe in a waterproof bag, as all sailormen should. Gradually the fog in my brain started to shred out. I began to remember.\n\nFirst it was Mary Logan. She had promised to marry me back in New Bedford. She had laid her little hands in my great, horny ones, and pressed her lips against my cheeks, murmuring words of endearment, and promising to wed me in a fortnight. All the time she knew she was lying, for her plans had been laid to run away with Benjy Harrison that very night. Something snapped inside of me then; the world went black before my eyes. Later I shipped on the Mary Rose, bound for Port Royal.\n\nBut it wasn’t Mary’s treachery that had made me leave the old tramp. What was it? I pressed my fists against my aching temples, and tried to think.\n\nAh, I had it!\n\nIt was on account of what Hong Fat showed me—that and the sugared rum, I guess. The filthy, slit-eyed Chinaman was a magician in his own country, he said, and I’ll give it to him that he was clever. For two dollars he went through his whole bag of tricks, but it didn’t satisfy me. I’m a deep-water sailor, and I come from a long line of blue-nosed, psalm-singing Puritans, but there’s a streak of the mystic in me. I always wanted to look behind the veil, and Hong Fat said he could lift it for me.\n\nSo I gave him five dollars to do it. He brought out a little bronze bowl from under his robe, and made some passes over it with his clean, long-nailed fingers. A thick, oily smoke curled up from it and almost hid his emaciated yellow face and beady eyes.\n\nThen he asked me in his crooked Shantung dialect if I could understand Chinese. I told him yes, rather sourly, for the smoke was making me drowsy.\n\n“Sailor man,” he said in his singsong way. “You are a brave one—a brave man, but you have done enough wrong to offend the gods; wrongs that you must atone for.”\n\n“Wrongs?” I said. “I’ve led a pretty rough life, but a square one, and I can’t call to mind anyone in particular that I’ve wronged. I’d like to kill Benjy Harrison, but I haven’t done it, so you can’t call that a wrong. As for Mary Logan—\n\n“No, I can’t call any to mind,” I’ said.\n\nWhat of the smoke there was a tightening around my throat, and my arms and legs had lost all feeling. “Hurry up—tell me—what was it—when—?”\n\n“Not in this life,” droned Hong Fat. “Long, long ago—”\n\nThe smoke flattened out like a gray screen. There were pictures on it, but so jumbled and twisted at first that I could not make head or tail of them. I seemed to see Mary’s face peep out, but I couldn’t be sure. Then the pictures began to take shape. Familiar things flashed up. I seemed to be going back into the past—centuries ago—\n\nSuddenly there sprang into view the old city of Panama, with its houses of aromatic rosewood and the tower of the great Cathedral of St. Anastasius. I could see the slave markets, where black men were being sold, while their buyers sat at tables, sipping Peruvian wine. Beyond the city rolled the green savannahs, and on one side an arm of the sea crept inland. It was the Panama of the old days, before Sir Henry Morgan sacked it.\n\nI don’t know why I recognized it, for the ancient city was gone long before I was born. There is left only a tangle of weeds and sun-cracked limestone. The slave-market is a swamp; the haven a stretch of surf-beaten mud, inhabited by pelicans quarreling over the stinking remains of fish. But, in spite of that, I saw old Panama there in the smoke, and felt as a man does when he comes upon a forgotten nook. Except for this: At sight of all that beauty a crawling horror whelmed up in my throat, and I would have screamed and beat the air, but it was as though only my brain was present. I had no consciousness of a physical body.\n\nMen came into the picture. They were muscular and bronzed, with the rolling gait of sailors. They wore hats, wide of brim and running into a peak, dirty linen shirts and knickerbockers. Around their waists were sashes, bristling with knives, and they carried guns of a make that would seem strange to modern eyes. They were Morgan’s buccaneers on their way to the sack of Panama—to pillage and burn and torture and rape. I recognized them: Dubose, with his swagger and black mustachios, squat Sawkins, one-eyed Peter Harris, Ringrose, and then—God pity me!—I saw myself, running with the rest, sweat stained, ragged, but with the lust of battle flushing my cheeks. At the head of the troop was a tall man, with a face framed by lank gray curls —as cruel and evil and ruthless a face as this old world has ever seen. His clothes, of silks and satin and lace, were as weatherworn as those of his men. No need to ask myself who it was. I knew him as I had known the others—Morgan, the damned!—the man I had followed in a forgotten century across the blood-smeared waters of the Caribbean!\n\nI knew then why Hong Fat had said my wrong was a great one. None could fight under the black flag of this arch brother-of-the-coast without loading his soul with crime.\n\nSitting there in a dazed trance I watched the capture and sack of Panama—living over again the wild excitement of that day. The clash of swords on steel casques and breastplates; the priests and nuns whipped before the advance to place scaling ladders against the walls; hate-twisted Spanish faces in the desperate struggle on the ramparts; the final capitulation of the town.\n\nThe smoke cloud grew darker. The pictures that followed faded as though the scene of torture and outrage were too terrible for the black art of Hong Fat to compass. Through the haze I saw the Chinaman’s yellow face and beady eyes watching me with a sort of sardonic leer.\n\nI tried to speak. I fought the air with my numbed arms, but the words would not come to my lips.\n\n“That is not all,” croaked Hong Fat in his weird dialect. “There is more.”\n\nThe smoke screen flattened again, as though his claw-like hand had stroked it into a semblance of gray velvet. The figures grew life-like on the cursed chart.\n\nThis time it showed the guardroom of the fort at Panama—a room piled high with plunder torn from the ravished town. Through the open casements I could see the fires of the burning houses, and memory brought back the shouts of the pirates and the shrieks of tortured citizens.\n\nThere were two men in the room—Morgan, with his fierce, wrinkled face and—and I was there. You might think it a trick of the Chinaman’s, but as each scene flashed on I recalled it. Oh, yes, I had been there—as vile as any of those bloodstained brothers-of-the-coast. And my punishment was stretching through the ages.\n\nI hung on each succeeding step, my breath whistling through my nostrils like a foundered horse.\n\nMorgan waved his hand, and a woman was led in between two buccaneers. At sight of her the whole tale came back to me. Her face was the face of Mary Logan, dark and proud and beautiful. She wore the dress of a Spanish gentlewoman, and I remembered that back in those fading days of the seventeenth century she bore the name of Donna Isabella de Guayra—and that I loved her then as I loved her reincarnation named Mary Logan.\n\nI had saved her life in Panama before I joined Morgan’s crew, and had killed her Spanish lover when he found me in her garden. They outlawed me, of course, and I became a pirate to come back to her—the only way that was open for me. She swore that she loved me, and would wait. When they led her in my-heart blazed. At last the hour of my triumph had come.\n\nThere on the smoke screen, Morgan leaned back in his chair, and over the ages I heard his voice ringing in my ears.\n\n“This man says he loves you. S’death, you’re worth loving, madame, but why throw yourself away on him when there are better men around?”\n\nI looked at her, my lips moving.\n\n“It is not Harry Morgan’s way to stand back when there are women or gold to get,” the pirate said. “You can have him if your love is so strong that it will face death for him. So sure as you take him I’ll burn you both at the stake.”\n\nMy hand went to the knife at my hip, but I was helpless. The muskets of the two pirates were leveled at me.\n\n“And—and if I do not choose him, señor?” the girl asked.\n\nMorgan’s face wreathed itself in a terrible smile. “If you choose me I’ll cover you with diamonds. By my faith, not a ship on the Spanish Main but will contribute to your wealth. So there you have it. Holyoak and death or Sir Henry Morgan and wealth!”\n\nThe girl’s dark eyes flamed into little golden points.\n\n“He killed the man who loved me,” she said. “He took a life for his own selfish pleasure, senor. Is it not possible that he will also take mine if I cleave unto you?”\n\nThe buccaneer’s pistol was in his hand.\n\n“Stay with me, and Holyoak dies,” said he.\n\nDonna Isabella—who, in this century, betrayed me again, looked me full in the eyes. Her own were hard.\n\n“I will stay with you, Señor Morgan,” she whispered.\n\nThen I saw in the smoke Morgan’s pistol flame. It was the end for me.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nBlue Anchor Inn\n\nI came to myself with a nervous jerk. The lights of Port Royal twinkled at my back. The Mary Rose had disappeared. How long I had been sitting there on the cask, pondering on the strange things Hong Fat had shown me I do not know. My head felt queer. The dragging sensation at the nape of my neck was stronger. I staggered a little as I walked off the wharf.\n\nFor how many æons would Mary’s treachery be repeated in reparation for my murder of the Spanish grandee? As the Donna Isabella she had betrayed me to Morgan. As Mary Logan she had cast me aside for Benjy Harrison. And as surely as we died and were born again she would repeat that treachery unless—unless—\n\nI knew Port Royal as well as anyone, but tonight it seemed strange to my eyes—somehow smaller and older and more cramped. Why this should be I could not tell, unless Hong Fat’s cursed. smoke still twisted my senses.\n\nI followed the crooked street until I came to the Blue Anchor Inn, a tavern huddled under the lee of the old Spanish fort—the very tavern, too, where Sir Henry Morgan had planned the sack of Panama. The night was warm, the doors wide flung, and I heard half a hundred rollicking voices roaring out that melody by the poet of London town, so popular among the buccaneers:\n\n“In frolic dispose your pounds, shillings and pence.\n\nWe’ll be damnably mouldy a hundred years hence.”\n\nWhy should they sing that seventeenth century ballad in the Port Royal of 1920? Controlling, by an effort, the nervous twitch of my muscles, I entered the Blue Anchor.\n\nIt was not the room itself, hazy with the fumes of tobacco smoke and smelling strongly of the native rum, that startled me. It was the men sitting around the tables, pounding the oaken tops with their mugs and flagons, and roaring that old carefree ditty. They were Morgan’s men—dingy clothed, scarlet sashed, heavily armed. God of battles! was I mad? There sat Peter Harris, with a black patch over his missing eye; here swaggered Dubose, mustachios bristling, and at the head of the table, Morgan, as savage and ruthless looking as when he had roamed the Main. That had been before the first King Charles lost his head—and this was 1920!\n\nPerhaps I staggered a bit. At any rate, I stood blinking dazedly through the haze. They saw me, raised their flagons and shouted:\n\n“Holyoak! Welcome, old scoundrel. We sail tomorrow for the sack of Panama.”\n\nI had eyes for none of them but Morgan. He lay back in his chair, one fist gripping the pewter mug, his gaze riveted on me. I rested my knuckles on the table, and stared at him as I sought to control the quaver that I knew would sound in my voice. My brain hammered like a kettledrum.\n\n“So ‘tis you, is it?” cried the buccaneer captain. “Old Holyoak, as I live!”\n\n“Yes,” I said hoarsely.\n\n“And what would you have of me, my bold rover?”\n\n“Your life,” said I, “if I can take it. Are you real—real flesh and blood? If you are, ’fore God, I’ll have a knife between your ribs for what you did to me and the Donna Isabella.”\n\nHis voice was dreamy. “Donna Isabella? I call her not to mind. There were many women in my life—many, many of them. Harry Morgan’s way, you know.”\n\n“At Panama,” I shouted. There was a red mist before my eyes. How I hated the man! If I had much to answer for, what punishment could fit his crimes?\n\n“Ah, yes, at Panama. I tired of her quickly, and she went the way of the rest. But what would you do? I died peaceably in my bed, Holyoak, not on the rack as the Spaniards hoped I would. How can you avenge your black-eyed aristocrat? What can you do to a man who has been dead these two centuries and more?”\n\nThe pirates laughed, and pounded their flagons on the table.\n\nSomething snapped in my brain. The room grew black, save for that lean, sneering face, framed by its gray curls. Morgan had thrust back his chair, and risen, smiling.\n\nI was unarmed, but I rushed at him—all my fear of the man swept away in the passionate urge for vengeance. He carried a long knife in the scarlet sash around his waist. I tore it away—knowing that the man was a ghost and that I could do him no harm. I swung the glittering blade aloft—and then the blackness of death enveloped me—I felt the salt foam on my lips. I—I—\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Most Unfortunate Occurrence\n\nExcerpt from the Port Royal Jamaican:\n\nA most unfortunate occurrence marred the brilliant “Buccaneer Fete,” given in honor of the Governor last night. An American sailor, named Holyoak, deserted from his ship, the Mary Rose, which sailed yesterday for Boston.\n\nHe went to the Blue Anchor tavern, which had been a favorite resort of Sir Henry Morgan’s crew, in the old days of the brothers-of-the-coast, apparently much the worse for drink. An old Chinaman named Hong Fat had persuaded Holyoak that he was a reincarnated member of the buccaneers who sacked Panama. Everyone present in the Blue Anchor had heard of the hoax. They deluded the drunken sailor into believing that they were all Morgan’s men, returned to life. Holyoak apparently became crazed with fear, snatched a machete from the girdle of Lieutenant Buckenham, who was impersonating Sir Henry Morgan, and stabbed himself …\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nMary Logan\n\nOn the same day the New Bedford Herald told of the suicide of a woman named Mary Logan, who had stabbed herself with a sailor’s knife—a curio owned by Benjamin Harrison, and said to have been carried at the sack of Panama by Sir Henry Morgan!\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Introduction\n  A Young Man in Love\n  The Interloper\n  A Bachelor Repents\n  The Fatal Crash\n  A Lover’s Anxiety\n  The Cigarette Case\n  Lucinda’s Killer\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nJohn Burton took a pin from his coat lapel and carefully elaborated the filigree tracery with which he had previously covered the surface of his cigarette case.\n\n“I like that,” said Lucinda Mowbray, gazing at the case across the lavishly-equipped luncheon table. “Give it to me, please.”\n\nBurton gave her the case, and she put it in her handbag, where she had put many another of Burton’s presents during the brief period in which they had been acquainted.\n\nDeprived of this outlet for his nervous energy, he fidgeted in his seat, and flipped open the folded paper which had rested on the table at his elbow.\n\nAs he did so, the bill was placed at his other elbow by a waiter. Burton glanced at it, taking care to display no more than bored interest, and turned again to the paper.\n\n“I see this chap, Dixon Hawke, has recovered those Hatton Garden jewels. I’ll bet he makes some money.”\n\nHe had involuntarily emphasised the “he,” and the girl was quick to notice this.\n\n“But surely,” she said, “you’re not interested in making money?”\n\n“Eh? Oh—er—no. Rather not. I have all I need, thank goodness.”\n\nHe strove to make light conversation, and on this occasion he did not acquit himself too well, for his mind kept drifting back to the subjects of Dixon Hawke, of criminal investigation, and of the business of “making money.”\n\nThings were not going right for him. He had “borrowed” some three hundred pounds from the bank where he was employed as ledger-clerk, and that wealthy uncle of his, Arnold Croxton, had failed to “come across ” with the usual annual substantial gift which would have enabled him to put things right.\n\nThe silly old fool was having a love affair with a nursemaid, and she was the cause of the trouble. Burton had not seen her, and he only knew of her existence through vague rumours from Fenside, Croxton’s country home.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nA Young Man in Love\n\nBurton was feeling a white-hot resentment against this unknown nursemaid, this intruder who threatened to rob him of his inheritance, and even his liberty. Already he saw the prison gates looming ahead on account of her. In a slightly lesser degree, he was infuriated with his uncle.\n\nCroxton, his sole surviving relative, was his mother’s brother. His mother had eloped with a chauffeur, and Burton, consequently, did not belong in Croxton’s class of society, though Croxton had been benevolently disposed to him since his parents’ death.\n\nIt was Croxton who had given him the taste for extravagant living, and the mess in which he now found himself was, he argued, Croxton’s fault.\n\nOn the other hand, it was Croxton who had introduced him to Carlotti’s Club, where he now was, and it was through visiting Carlotti’s that he had got to know Lucinda. And Lucinda meant everything to him.\n\n“I’ll meet you here again tomorrow?” he asked as they rose. Lucinda eyed him half mockingly.\n\n“When are you going to invite me to your place in Mayfair?” she demanded.\n\n“Oh—er—I’ve got the decorators in just now,” he said glibly. “I’m staying at one of my clubs, you know.” As he spoke he was agonisingly conscious of how the bottom would fall out of his world if she ever suspected that he lived in lodgings in Brixton.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Interloper\n\nBurton settled the bill, and having put Lucinda in a taxi, he walked citywards. All the way to the bank, his mind was grappling desperately with reality.\n\nHe had another three clear days. His exposure would then be a certainty. Probably he was already suspected. Would his “borrowings ” be discovered even if he raised the money in time for the audit?\n\nHe thought of Dixon Hawke. His bank retained the services of Hawke. Would the detective come probing, spying, asking questions?\n\nAt the bank that afternoon things began to look blacker for Burton. There was no mistaking the manager’s attitude. He suspected. He might arrange a surprise audit before the three days were up. Something had to be done, and done at once.\n\nAt six o’clock Burton got in the big sports car that was partly responsible for his trouble and drove off towards Fenside. The car had cost him nearly three hundred pounds, and now, such was the condition of the second-hand market, he could not realise a hundred on it.\n\nHe cursed the second-hand market, and fumed against the woman who had won his uncle’s affections. What was her name? he asked himself, as he drove on. Maggs. Sarah Maggs! She was nursemaid to some kids at a house in Moreton, eighteen miles from Fenside.\n\nOld Brown, his uncle’s gardener, had told him about her.\n\nHis uncle, according to Brown, had “fallen for her real bad.” He had bought her innumerable presents, including a baby car. The old ass was being so extravagant in his attentions that he was obliged to neglect his nephew.\n\nThus ranged Burton’s thoughts during the drive to Fenside. The last part of the journey, between Moreton and Fenside, was over steeply undulating hills, gashed in several places by deep chalk-pits.\n\nIn one place the road ran along the edge of one of these quarries. It was dangerous in the extreme. Only a broken-down wire fence and a sloping strip of glass separated the road from a three-hundred-foot precipice.\n\n“A simple way of bumping anybody off—just force their car over the edge!” he reflected, and he started as the idle notion passed through his head.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Bachelor Repents\n\nBurton turned his car in to the drive of Fenside House, his uncle’s home. There was a baby car at the door, and he ground his teeth at the sight of it.\n\nThe butler showed him into the library.\n\n“Mr. Croxton will be with you shortly,” said the man. “He has a visitor at the moment.”\n\n“Miss Maggs?” asked Burton casually.\n\n“Yes, sir. They’re in the drawingroom.”\n\nWith difficulty Burton concealed his impatience and anger, and when the butler had left the room he paced up and down, puffing furiously at a cigarette. Then he strode irritably across to the radio and switched it on.\n\n“Before the news,” said the announcer’s voice, “here is a police message. At six o’clock last night a cyclist was knocked down at Kingston by a blue saloon car, which did not stop. Will the driver of the car, or anyone who saw the accident, communicate with New Scotland Yard, telephone number–”\n\nBurton switched off.\n\nHow often, he wondered, did the police trace these cars which ran people down and failed to stop? The announcements were made frequently, yet one never heard of the driver being traced when his number had not been taken.\n\nHe strolled out through the French windows into the garden, and it was from the shrubbery near the orchard that he eventually saw Miss Maggs depart.\n\nHe could not form any opinion of her personal charms, on account of the distance between them and the fact that her back was towards him all the time she was within view. From his uncle’s solicitous behaviour as he fussed round her, however, it was evident that Croxton had a very high opinion of them indeed.\n\nShe climbed into the baby car and drove off up the steep hill in the direction of Moreton.\n\n“You know, I can’t promise to do this again, my boy,” Croxton was saying a quarter of an hour later. “We all have to learn to draw our horns in at times, I mean.”\n\nHo was forcing a tone of severity, being in a far from severe mood.\n\n“You see,” he said, a trifle diffidently, “I don’t intend remaining an irresponsible old bachelor much longer.”\n\n“Are you going to marry that nurse?” asked Burton bluntly.\n\n“Well,” was the rejoinder, “what if I am? Nice, wholesome, sweet-natured girl. Look after me, dash it! Prevent me doing silly things like this. And anyway she’s not a nursemaid any longer—gave up her job some time ago, on my suggestion. Would never have done for me to be marrying somebody’s employed servant, you know.”\n\nHe took his fountain pen from his pocket and signed a cheque.\n\nBefore he left, Burton learned that Miss Maggs was a nightly visitor to Fenside House, and he was very thoughtful as he drove back to London.\n\nThe next day, after he had made good his defalcations, with the help of his uncle’s cheque, he once more visited Carlotti’s.\n\nLucinda did not turn up.\n\nShe often acted in this capricious way, and her absence served as an acute reminder of what life would be like without her. He could not bear the thought of it. He had to live up to her world. He just had to have old Croxton’s money.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Fatal Crash\n\n“Before the news,” said the announcer’s voice, as Tommy Burke switched on the wireless in Dixon Hawke’s Dover Street study, “here is a police message. At about ten o’clock last night Miss Sarah Maggs, a nurse, of Moreton, drove her car over a cliff-edge near the village of Fenside. She was returning from a visit to the home of Mr. Arnold Croxton, and it is believed that a fast sports car, which drove by without allowing her sufficient room, forced her to drive on to the grass. Her car skidded over the grass, through a broken fence, and toppled over the precipice. She was instantly killed. The sports car did not stop, and continued in the direction of London. Will the driver of this car, who may not have been aware of the accident, please communicate–’ ’\n\n“Arnold Croxton,” said Tommy. “That’s the uncle of one of these bank clerks listed for inquiry.”\n\nCertain irregularities had been suspected by the London United Bank, at a branch of which Burton worked, but no definite proof bad been forthcoming. It had been Hawke’s task to inquire into the mode of life of certain of the staff.\n\nIt was one of those uncongenial but necessary routine tasks, and Hawke had deputed it to Tommy.\n\n“The chap’s name is Burton,” said the youth. “John Burton. He goes to Carlotti’s, but that doesn’t mean anything wrong at the bank. He bites the uncle’s ear a good deal.”\n\nBoth forgot the matter until the following morning, when Hawke was visited by Arnold Croxton himself.\n\nCroxton was in a distracted, almost hysterical state.\n\n“You can’t bring her back to me,” he said, after explaining how matters stood, “but, by heavens, you can see justice done. You must find this infernal road hog. The police are no good. They pigeonhole it. What are we coming to that hare-brained idiots can go about killing people like this, and get away with it?”\n\nHawke did his best to calm the man, and finally accepted an invitation to spend a weekend at Fenside House and make a personal inquiry into the fatality.\n\nOn arrival there he was introduced to a burly and somewhat petulant young man, who sat on a leather fender seat in the drawingroom, moodily scratching patterns on a new cigarette- case with a pin.\n\n“This is my nephew,” announced Croxton, “John Burton.”\n\nFrom the first moment of their meeting Hawke sensed that the young man was curiously interested in him, and this feeling grew to a conviction as time went on.\n\nBurton followed him about, and Hawke several times found him watching him as though about to speak but unable to pluck up the resolution to do so.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nA Lover’s Anxiety\n\nThe detective visited the local police station, where he made a careful inspection of the wrecked car and its contents.\n\nAfterwards he went to the cliff-top and searched the ground.\n\nHe noted that one of the soft wooden posts of the broken wire fence had been struck by some heavy metallic object about a foot from ground level.\n\nPointing it out to Tommy, he remarked: “That was made by the hub of a big car. It wasn’t done by the baby car.”\n\n“That doesn’t get us very far, does it?” exclaimed Tommy.\n\n“I’m afraid not. The chances of our ever tracing the thing are pretty remote.”\n\nReturning to the house, Hawke was cornered by Burton, who, after some display of nervous hesitancy, said: “I wonder if you would undertake a commission for me, Mr. Hawke. I’m very anxious to trace the whereabouts of a friend of mine in London. A Miss Lucinda Mowbray.”\n\nHe spoke in distinctly agitated tones, and worked away furiously with the pin on his cigarette case.\n\n“I’m no good at inquiries,” he explained. “Haven’t the cheek to go up to hotel waiters and other people asking vague questions; but it would be easy for you.”\n\nHawke smiled at this.\n\n“I do my best,” he said. “You sound very interested in the young lady.”\n\n“I am,” was the fervent answer. “I don’t know what I shall do if I can’t find her.”\n\n“Dear me. In that case, I shall have to see what I can do. You’re something of an engraver, I see.”\n\n“Oh, I’m always doing this. I can’t resist a plain metal surface. I want to draw flowers and leaves all over it. Especially when I’m — er — deep in thought. By the way, Lucinda has one of my engraved cases. I gave it to her the last time we met. Perhaps that’s a clue, eh? If you see a young lady with a cigarette-case engraved like this you’ll know its Lucinda, I mean.”\n\n“Quite,” answered Hawke dryly. “I’ll be on the lookout. Incidentally, is Miss Mowbray not likely to try to get in touch with you?”\n\nBurton coloured slightly.\n\n“I—she doesn’t know I’m a bank clerk. You see, she belongs in society, and she thinks–”\n\n“Oh,” said Hawke shortly.\n\nBurton had revealed his snobbishness, and the man from Dover Street did not suffer snobs gladly.\n\nShortly after this interview a very odd thought occurred to the detective, and he returned to the police station, where he had an interview with the superintendent.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nThe Cigarette Case\n\nHawke and Tommy drove back to London on the Sunday night.\n\n“A deucedly odd business this,” commented the detective, and Tommy was puzzled.\n\n“I don’t see much in it, sir; frankly, I don’t.”\n\nThey were passing over the road near the chalk quarry, and Hawke pointed to the grass verge where the disaster had occurred.\n\n“It was no accident,” he said. “The sports car not only drove the little one on to the grass; it followed. It actually pushed the nurse’s car over the edge, for its hub struck that post.”\n\nDuring the next few days Tommy was busy with Burton’s commission.\n\nHe inquired at Carlotti’s, and the commissionaire recalled the lady he sought.\n\n“She hasn’t been here for several days,” he said. “All I can tell you about her is that she sometimes got in a taxi and called to the driver to take her to the Berkeley Hotel.”\n\nSo Tommy inquired at the Berkeley Hotel and learned that no Lucinda Mowbray was known there.\n\n“It looks,” remarked Hawke, “as though she was a fake as well. The instructions to the taxi-driver to drive her to the Berkeley were probably to impress Burton.”\n\n“You think they were a pair of snobs kidding one another about their social standing, eh, guv’nor?”\n\n“Yes, but I’d like to check it as far as possible. See what you can find out from the taxi-drivers.”\n\nWhen all inquiries had been completed Hawke sought out Burton. Six days had slipped by, and he learned that the young bank clerk was spending another weekend at Fenside. He was pursuing a policy of “keeping in” with his uncle.\n\n“That’s excellent,” said the detective. “Just where I want him to be. Off we go. Tommy. He’ll be mightily interested to know that we’ve finally discovered the whereabouts of his Lucinda.”\n\nHe interviewed Burton that evening in the garden at Fenside.\n\n“What news?” asked the young man.\n\n“I’ve traced Lucinda Mowbray.”\n\n“You have? Where is she? For heaven’s sake tell me. I must see her.”\n\nBut Hawke did not satisfy his curiosity.\n\n“All in good time,” he said. “Remember I have other inquiries to attend to. Yours isn’t my only case. There’s this question of the quarry crash, for instance. I have a line on that, and it’s chiefly on that account that I came down here.”\n\nHawke calmly put his hand in his hip pocket and produced an elaborately, though amateurishly, engraved cigarette case.\n\nBurton stared at it, and was beside himself with excitement.\n\n“That’s it. That’s the case I gave Lucinda. Where is she? Did she give it to you to return to me?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nLucinda’s Killer\n\nHawke returned the case to his pocket. “I’m going up the hill,” he said, “to have another look at the scene of that accident.”\n\nHe began to move away, and, as he had expected, Burton came after him.\n\n“I’ll drive you up there,” said Burton. “You mustn’t keep me on tenterhooks. Tell me–”\n\nBurton got out his car and drove the detective up the hill.\n\nAt the latter’s request he drew the car in to the left-hand side of the road, and was still asking vain questions when Hawke set about examining the damaged wooden post.\n\nHe picked it up and carried it across the grass, trailing the wires after it.\n\nHe placed it against the nearside front wheel of the car.\n\n“As I thought,” he said. “This indentation exactly fits your hub-cap. Now, would you like to tell me where you were on the night when Miss Maggs was killed?”\n\nBurton was silent for a moment. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse with terror.\n\n“You—you trapped me into coming up here, you—you–”\n\n“Yes,” Hawke said evenly. “I trapped you into coming here with me. Not only that, but I left word with my assistant to follow us and to bring the police superintendent with him. And there, I think, is the police car coming up the hill now.”\n\nBurton looked round wildly.\n\n“But what–” he choked. “Even if I was the driver of that sports car, it was an accident, wasn’t it? I couldn’t–”\n\n“It was no accident.” Hawke’s voice was pitilessly cold. “I have sufficient evidence to prove that it was murder. You deliberately forced that unfortunate young woman’s car over the edge.”\n\nThe police car came to a standstill beside them, and the superintendent produced a pair of handcuffs as he stepped out.\n\n“Tell me one thing,” demanded Burton, before he was taken away. “Where is Lucinda?”\n\n“You and she,” said Hawke, “were both playing the same silly game of make-believe, each thinking the other a means of social climbing. You both had the same idea, and were, by chance, both introduced to Carlotti’s by the same person. Lucinda Mowbray,” he added, “is dead. Murdered.”\n\n“What!” shouted Burton. “Who killed her?”\n\n“You did. You see, I found this cigarette case in Miss Sarah Maggs’ handbag.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n\nJimmy Dolan, No. 7774, must be on his best behavior if he’s going to get out of the big pen, verify the message and exact revenge on the man who snitched.\n\nThrough that mysterious subterranean news channel that links every big penitentiary with the rendezvous of crooks in the outside world, a message had come to a man who had long since lost his identity in the number, “7774.”\n\nThe message was brief, but it spoke volumes to the convict. It had come from a pal, a former companion in the old days, who had shared in many a job that had required finely sandpapered fingertips to insure mastery over the tumblers of a safe.\n\nConvict No. 7774 had come to number the days when good behavior would end a five-year sentence in less than four. He had planned and resolved, as many men before him down aeons of time, to allow no act or influence to deviate him from a life of honesty. But the message changed him. It set another purpose; made the days seem ages longer than before, although the man could count the nearness of liberation on one hand.\n\nThe day of his release came—a day with a dull-drab sky overhead, a day that enveloped his being in the purpose at hand.\n\nCreeping stealthily along a passageway that admitted no light save that which came through a barred window in a door at its end, Quong Wong, a fence for crooks, and keeper of an opium den, listened until a signal for entrance had been repeated with unmistakable distinction. Only until then did the Oriental approach near the door and open it slightly to scrutinize the features of his nocturnal visitor.\n\n“It’s me, Quong,” a voice whispered, “Jimmy Dolan—don’t you know me?”\n\nThe Oriental continued to stare. He knew the face only too well, but if he recognized the man, he gave no indication.\n\n“Come on, Quong; let me in. You know me. I come your place all the time—long time ago—you remember—got arrested here—sent to San Quentin. Remember?”\n\nAfter a moment, the Oriental asked: “You in trouble?”\n\n“No—no trouble, Quong. Why you ask?”\n\nThe Oriental did not answer. He drew back and allowed the white man to enter. The visitor strode down the passageway with a quick, nervous step. At the other end he admitted himself to a dimly lighted room, where a row of bunks on each side gave it the unmistakable identity of an opium den. The Oriental followed quickly behind him.\n\n“Where’s the gang, Quong?” asked the man.\n\n“All gone,” was the reply. Then, after a pause: “Police-a-man come, raid. Slim, him get catched; the kid, too.”\n\nThe name “kid” smote upon the white man, and if the Oriental had noticed he would have seen his eyes narrow.\n\n“What’d they get the kid for?”\n\n“Police-a-man say break safe.”\n\n“He lies—some one snitched!” And the white man’s attitude for the moment was menacing. Quickly he recovered himself.\n\n“Who stooled?” he persisted, and his eyes bored through the Oriental until the slant-eyed heathen had to shift his gaze.\n\n“No understand.” The Oriental has fortified himself behind two English words which furnish an impenetrable barrier for further questioning when the wily yellow race chooses to evade cross-examination.\n\nThe white man shifted on his feet. “Come on, Quong, get the layout; I haven’t had a smoke in ages. Quit a five-year sentence this morning, cut to three and a half.”\n\nThe Oriental went to a closet and returned with a large tray and a thick pipe. The white man took off his coat and prepared to smoke. The Oriental watched the man’s every move—all but one. Had his eyes remained on the white man, he would have seen a quick substitution of the opium to a harmless, hard substance, with the same pungent smell as the deadly drug, that went into the pipe instead. The white man stretched himself on a lower bunk, and, drawing deeply on the pipe, dropped off into the apparent lethargy that the juice of the poppy brings to its slaves.\n\nSatisfying himself that his visitor had gone to the land of dreams, the Oriental stole quietly from the room. If he had turned, he would have caught the white man’s eyes following his movements. Half an hour elapsed. The white man never moved. Then the Oriental came back into the room. A figure followed him closely, but neither spoke.\n\n“Him same dead,” the Oriental said, after a silence, before which the newcomer had gone to the side of the sleeping man and raised an eyelid. “Him no smoke four years—sleep much now,” the Chinaman continued.\n\n“All right, Quong,” the man spoke for the first time, “keep an eye on that bird and let me know every time he comes here. We don’t want him now, but you can never tell. He’s only out a day. Give him time. He’ll go back to a moral certainty. Thanks to you, Quong, his pal has a home in Folsom for a bit that’ll keep him out of mischief for fifteen years. Clever job, Ouong. Without the tip we’d never’ve got him. This bird ought to be at Folsom with him. Quong”—and the man started toward the door—“you’ve sent more crooks to the pen than the whole department. Might drop in later when this bird comes to. Want to break the news that the kid has gone on a long journey.” Glancing back in the direction of the man who lay sleeping, he passed through the door.\n\nAn hour later, Detective Jos Goss, of the San Francisco Chinatown squad, rapped a signal on a door of a house in Wakeley Alley. There was no response. Then he tried the door and found it open. Groping his way along a passageway, he stumbled over a body. Stooping, he took an electric flash light from his pocket, and the first thing its bright rays disclosed was a pool of blood; then the still, white face of Quong Wong.\n\nThe detective didn’t stop to notify the morgue—there was more important business at hand. In twenty minutes a police net had been spread throughout the city for Jimmy Dolan, ex-convict, and, until that same morning, known as convict No. 7774.\n\nIt was almost dawn when Goss was summoned to the city hospital. At the door of the accident ward, he was met by a plain-clothes man.\n\n“We got him, Goss, but he put up an awful fight. The doc says he’s done for—light’ll go out any minute now.” Stepping over to the bedside of the wounded man, Goss bent over him. Dolan opened his eyes when the detective spoke to him.\n\n“You’re going to die, boy. Why did you do it?”\n\n“I should worry,” the dying man gasped, “for I got that dirty yellow snitch.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Clinsey smiled grimly. Ten years he’d waited for Marmaduke to die, but this was better. Now the old man would soon know the black knife had struck again.\n\nClinsey eased his foot off the gas, letting the red coupé drift to a stop in front of the Lake City post office. He slipped his fit lie body from under the wheel, stretched, smoothed the wrinkles from his clothing, looked around.\n\nHere he was again, for the fourth and final time, to strike the last blow for Happy Charley. He. whom they called the Black Butcher, three times a killer in their midst, the phantom who had faded away leaving three black knives in three white throats, back again!\n\nHe could not forego a twinge of apprehension as he recalled his last visit here, when he had struck down the gambler, Simon LeFrage. They had nearly trapped him then. One of them had seen his face — old Joe Marmaduke. But now he was safe, for the old man — the only person in the world who could identify him as the Black Butcher — was blind.\n\nWith Marmaduke blind Clinsey could operate freely, safe to wait a right opportunity for leaving black knife number four in Saul Dickson’s throat.\n\n“I’m living at the local hotel,” Clinsey told the postmaster, “but I’d like to rent a private postbox.”\n\nThe postmaster produced a postbox rental contract, asked Clinsey his name.\n\n“Percy Clinsey. Occupation, engineer. I’m employed by the Browne Construction Company who is doing the highway resurfacing just north of town.”\n\nClinsey was telling the truth. He was an engineer, though he hadn’t followed the profession for years. He was employed by the Browne Construction Company on the highway project. He’d entered the company’s employment that morning, and was to begin active work a week hence when the regular engineer was to enter military service.\n\nThe postmaster said, “First class outfit, the Browne Company. Saul Dickson knows how to manage an outfit like that, but he’s been at it for twenty years. Long enough to learn the ropes, eh?”\n\n“I met Mr. Dickson only yesterday,” said Clinsey, “but he impressed me as being an able construction man.”\n\n“None better in this man’s country,” complimented the postmaster. “Everybody thought he went a little too far when he accused Happy Charley Tage of murdering Henry Browne, but it turned out Dickson knew what he was doing. Happy Charley was guilty, all right enough.” He assigned Clinsey a box number, handing him a slip of paper containing the box combination.\n\n“I’m a stranger to this state,” lied Clinsey. “I never heard of Happy Charley Tage and Henry Browne. Did this murder occur recently?”\n\n“Nope,” said the postmaster. “It happened ten years ago. The story’s too old for telling.”\n\n“Not if it’s a good one,” said Clinsey, his tone slightly urgent.\n\n“A good one? Well, I guess’ it’s a good one, if you mean by that, is it interesting? The three leading citizens of this town had their throats cut in the space of three nights, because they had testified in court against Happy Charley Tage. Judge Henry Brebaker, Ralph Kuttering, a wealthy merchant, and Simon LeFrage, a broker, all murdered in their homes in the dead of night. Dickson was to be the fourth victim, but I guess marrying Lona Tage, Happy Charley’s widow, saved him. But Lona died last month. Now there’s nothing to stand in the way of the Black Butcher, and — ”\n\n“The who?” questioned Clinsey.\n\n“The Black Butcher,” said the postmaster, his eyes widening in surprise that Clinsey should ask such a question. “But, of course, you’re a stranger here. . He shook his head gravely. “We called him the Black Butcher because be used a black butcher knife in each of his murders. Nobody ever learned his true name. But old Joe Marmaduke saw his face.”\n\nHis eyes, troubled and tinged with fear, held Clinsey’s a moment. “They .say the Black Butcher will return for Dickson, now that Lona is dead and Joe Marmaduke is blind and can’t identify him.”\n\nClinsey laughed lightly. “Nonsense,” he said. “The Black Butcher, as you call him, is probably dead or in prison by now.”\n\nThe postmaster shook his head doubtfully. “I guess he’s still alive and loose, all right,” he said. “He wouldn’t return as long as Lona lived and Marmaduke could see, because he isn’t truly a killer. An ordinary killer would have returned long ago, killed the man who could identify him, ignoring the woman who had been the wife of his dead friend, then waited his chance to cut Dickson’s throat. But the Black Butcher wants only the Wood of four men — Brebaker’s, Kuttering’s, LeFrage’s, and Dickson’s. And he’ll have Dickson’s yet. You mark it well, he’ll slit Dickson’s throat from ear to ear, like the other three.”\n\n“I hope it doesn’t happen soon,” Clinsey said lightly. “I’m to go to work for Dickson, you know. He promises to be a mighty swell boss.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Welcoming Committee Of One\n\nClinsey was in his room at the hotel sitting at a desk writing letters when somebody rapped.\n\n“Come in,” he said, watching the door.\n\nThe man who entered was one of the most comical looking persons Clinsey had ever seen. He was small, thinnish, duck-legged, skinny-necked, with a large head that was completely bald. He was smiling a smile that split his face wide open. It was a merry smile, warm and clean.\n\n“Hello,” he said. “My name is Baldy Clark.” He suddenly produced a package of gum from his coat pocket and held it toward Clinsey.\n\n“Have some,” he said easily, abandoning his entire face to the smile. He winked at Clinsey. “The stuff’s tough to get now. It ought to be. The guy that does the scrapping ought to have first right to do the chewing.”\n\nClinsey took a stick of gum, bent it into a perfect roll and put it in his mouth. “Thank you,” he said amiably. “May I be of some service to you, Mr. Clark? Won’t you sit down?”\n\n“No time for sitting down now,” said Clark. He continued to smile. Besides being one of the most comical persons he’d ever seen, Clinsey thought him the most friendly. “I just dropped in to welcome you to Lake City,” Clark went on. “You see, I’m chief of police around here, and for years it’s been customary for me to welcome newcomers. The town council chose me as a — a welcoming committee of one, sort of.”\n\nClark’s smile narrowed as he became a little self-conscious. “I was at the post office awhile ago and heard you talking with the postmaster. I — well, I hope you give the Browne Construction Company all you’ve got in the way of engineering ability, and find it pleasant and convenient to remain with us for a long, long time to come.” Clark showed relief at having delivered his little speech. It was evident that he smiled better than he talked.\n\n“Well, thank you!” said Clinsey. “You mean you make it a practice to welcome all strangers in this manner?”\n\n“I don’t give them all gum,” said Clark. “Some I give cigars. I give handkerchiefs and candy to the ladies. I gave you the gum because the hotel clerk said you used it.”\n\n“I’m very fond of gum,” admitted Clinsey, smiling lightly, showing interest and amusement.\n\n“Glad to give you some then.” Clark was still embarrassed from the effects of what to him had been a long speech and showed signs of wanting to get away.\n\n“Well, make yourself at home in Lake City, Mr. — what was the name?” His smile quit suddenly; and it was as if he lifted a false face. Minus the smile his face was solid and a bit bleak, his eyes steady and sad. The smile was absent only a moment, but in that moment Clinsey saw many things. One of them was danger.\n\n“My name is Percy Clinsey,” he said coolly.\n\n“Well, welcome to our metropolis,” said Clark. The smile was working full time again, the eyes as roguish as an Irish barber’s. “Now I’ll be letting you alone with your correspondence, Mr. Clinsey,” he said. “Good night.”\n\n“Cute fellow,” Clinsey told himself, making an effort to return to his letter writing. But it was no use. In a minute he gave it up, rose and began pacing the floor. “That fellow Clark is too smart,” he muttered. After about ten minutes he put on his coat and hat and went out,\n\nHe passed Clark in the lobby, nodding to him. Clark said, “Finished with your letter writing so soon, Mr. Clinsey ? Making them short but sweet, eh ? Well, that’s a good method. Many a man has been hanged for writing too much,”\n\nClark, Clinsey decided, was going to prove troublesome. As he walked through the town, enjoying the coolness of the night after what had been a remarkably hot day for early summer, Clinsey decided to make quick work of Dickson and get out of town.\n\nWhen Baldy Clark wasn’t smiling there was something annoyingly familiar about his face.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nStill Sharp\n\nSomebody had moved Clinsey’s letters. He knew how he’d left them because he always left them precisely the same way, stacked neatly, edges even, with the four corners pointing north, south, east and west. It was an old method of his, and now the letters on his desk were out of position. He shrugged lightly.\n\nOh, well, nothing there, nothing anywhere. He didn’t leave clues. But he must be on his guard. For some reason, and it worried him not to know why, he was under suspicion.\n\nBefore going to sleep Clinsey repledged himself to the destruction of Saul Dickson.\n\n“A little longer wait, then you can rest in peace, Charley,” Clinsey said. “I’m back now, near Dickson. The last knife is still sharp.”\n\nThat night Clinsey dreamed that he was cornered, trapped, and that a number of men, swinging clubs, was closing in on him. Leading them was old Joe Marmaduke, not blind at all, pointing a gnarled finger at him, saying, “His is the face! He is the Black Butcher!”\n\nThe next day Clinsey spent in his room reading. He went out for lunch and called at the post office for his mail. Renting a box and calling for mail was a sham. He had used it before to create amongst townspeople the feeling that he considered himself a permanent resident.\n\nTo his surprise there was a letter in his post box. He worked the combination quickly, without consulting the slip of paper the postmaster had given him with directions for working the box lock. The letter was from the postmaster, telling him when his box rent would be due, stating the fee for a year’s rental.\n\nHe met Baldy Clark as he left the post office. The chief of police was smiling, his eyes merry. Clinsey had the thought that if Clark was taller and a little more stoutish he’d make a first rate department store Santa Claus come Christmas.\n\n“Hello, Mr. Clinsey,” Clark said. “Did you have a good night’s rest?”\n\n“Very good,” said Clinsey stiffly.\n\n“Glad to hear it,” said Clark. “There’s an old superstition, you know, concerning first night in a strange bed. All dreams are supposed to come true. I hope you had nice dreams, Mr. Clinsey.” lie laughed gaily and passed inside the post office.\n\nClinsey’s heart missed a beat as he recalled his dream of the past night. He, in a corner … old Joe Marmaduke putting the finger on him … naming him the Black Butcher …\n\nThat evening after a light meal Clinsey took a short walk, directing his steps toward the little house where Joe Marmaduke lived alone. He slowed down as he walked past the unshuttered windows. He could see into the room. There, beneath a reading lamp, a book opened on his knees, sat Marmaduke. Clinsey stood staring into the room for. a long minute before he noticed how Marmaduke was tracing the pages with his finger.\n\n“Braille!” whispered Clinsey, relieved. For a minute he’d believed the newspaper account of Marmaduke’s blindness was faked, a lie told in public print for the eyes of the Black Butcher, bait to bring the murderer to the hook.\n\nBut Marmaduke was certainly blind. His lingers moving back and forth across the Braille proved it. Clinsey walked on, easier in his mind. Two blocks away Baldy Clark suddenly stepped out of a dark alley in front of him.\n\n“Nice evening, isn’t it, Mr. Clinsey?” he said, smiling broadly.\n\n“Yes, so it is,” agreed Clinsey, hiding as best he could his surprise at seeing Clark.\n\nClark walked back to the hotel with him. As they parted in the lobby Clinsey was convinced of one thing. He was beginning to be afraid of Clark. This living replica of something out of a comic valentine was smart and dangerous. There was a smug sureness about him that fought to undermine one’s self-confidence.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nBlood Hunt\n\nFor over an hour Clinsey sat in his room without turning on the lights, trying to recall his every act since his arrival in Lake City. Had he made a slip somewhere? Had any of his actions been such as to arouse suspicion? Since Joe Marmaduke’s blindness and Lona Dickson’s death the town was Black Butcher conscious. Everyone was talking about the ten year old murders, speculating on the possibility of the killer’s return.\n\nClinsey didn’t like the prevailing atmosphere. Still, if he worked wisely, it was the very atmosphere to be desired. The people were expecting an attempt to be made on Dickson’s life. All right, give them what they expected at the time they expected it, and it would come as a complete surprise. He’d always had most success when he applied the principles of this reasoning, besides he couldn’t afford to stay idle too long. Nerves would stand only so much, even the nerves of the Black Butcher.\n\nHe paced back and forth in the dark, his pulse quickening as he traced every step in his plan for cutting Saul Dickson’s throat. Somewhere in the outside stillness he heard, a clock strike midnight. He stopped pacing, broke open a fresh pack of gum, bent a stick of it into a roil and put it between his teeth. While he massaged it, letting its delicate sweetness flood his mouth, his hand – drew the black butcher knife from the sheath at his armpit. He let his thumb move lightly down its blade, sensing the razorlike keenness of the cutting edge, examining the needlelike sharpness of the point.\n\n“Tomorrow night, then,” he whispered as if speaking to somebody. “Dickson, I’ll get you this time!”\n\nStanding in the darkness his thoughts went back to those last few minutes in the death cell during his last visit with Happy Charley. His words were strong in his memory. “I’ll never rest, Charley, until I get the last one of them — Brebaker, Kuttering, LeFrage, and Dickson. Four for one, Charley, and you worth a million of them!”\n\nHappy Charley’s words came back to him, “Get them for me, fellow. The dirty rats! Cut their virtuous throats for them. While you’re doing it, I’ll be with you, in spirit. I’ll never let you down.”\n\nClinsey smiled grimly. Well, the blood hunt was about over. Just one of them left, Saul Dickson, businesslike, matter-of-fact, so deeply engrossed in constructing a turnpike that he would not be thinking of death, not until the black knife was at his throat.\n\nThe postmaster had said that Charley Tage was guilty. And so they all said, and so he had been. But Brebaker, Kuttering, LeFrage. and Dickson had been equally guilty. They’d all bargained to cut the cards. If any other of them had cut low and gone out and shot down their common enemy, the man who was set to expose their criminal work in doctored concrete, would the others have squealed? Not by a long shot they wouldn’t have. The deal had been fixed; the deck had been a deck of deuces.\n\nHe knew, didn’t he? Happy Charley had stayed free long enough to get possession of the deck. He’d broken into Judge Brebaker’s house and taken it from Brebaker’s desk. If they’d been smart they’d have destroyed that deck. But they’d felt safe, thinking that Happy Charley was alone, a man without friends. Well, so far, three of them knew better than that. Clinsey turned on the light and took the deck of deuces from a secret pocket inside his coat. He riffled the deck, ran out the cards one by one, letting them fall on the writing desk. Three of the deuces were marked with the three names, Brebaker, Kuttering, LeFrage.\n\nHe was returning the deck to his coat when somebody rapped on his door. He gritted his teeth, glancing at the clock. It was after midnight. Who?\n\n“Come in,” he said lightly.\n\nBaldy Clark entered, smiling cheerily. “Hello, Mr. Clinsey,” he said. “I saw your light come on and thought maybe you were lonesome. Thought maybe you’d like a little game of cards ?”\n\n“Do you ever sleep?” asked Clinsey.\n\n“Yes, when things are noisy. When things are quiet I stay awake. Noise is safe; silence is dangerous.” He stopped smiling for a moment, his face going solid. His merry eyes hardened, and a haggard look stuck in them.\n\nClark’s face without its smile was amazingly familiar to Clinsey. He’d known a face like it somewhere.\n\n“Well,” said Clark, “how about the little game? Will it be casino or rummy?”\n\n“Casino,” said Clinsey.\n\nThey sat down at the writing desk. Clark produced a deck from his coat pocket, handed it to Clinsey for the deal. Clinsey shuffled the cards quickly, began flicking them off the deck with his thumbnail. It was not an economical way to deal, because after so long it scarred the cards, his thumbnail cutting little ridges in the end edges.\n\nThey played for three hours, winning an even number of games. Finally Clark took his leave, saying that traffic was beginning to move in the streets again, which cured his insomnia. Clinsey invited him back for another game sometime.\n\nClinsey slept until noon the next day. When he awoke it was raining. A grim satisfaction welled within him. The nights the other three had died it was raining.\n\nAfter breakfast he went to the post office for his mail. There was no mail for him, but he met Saul Dickson outside the post office.\n\nDickson greeted him warmly. “There are some details concerning the work you are to do that need discussing, Mr. Clinsey,” he said. “The engineer is leaving day after tomorrow. We three should get together and talk things over before that time.”\n\nClinsey nodded, “How about tonight? I’m free anytime.”\n\n“Tonight will do nicely,” said Dickson. “Suppose you come to my apartment at nine. Willets, the engineer, will be there. We’ll cover all aspects of your work. Willets will give you all the necessary information.”\n\n“Very well. Expect me at nine,” Clinsey said.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nA Fixed Deck\n\nAt a few minutes of seven, after eating a light meal, Clinsey went to the garage and drove out the red coupe. The suitcases he’d taken to his hotel room were fakes, packed with bundles of waste paper. His clothing had never been removed from the turtleback trunk of his car. He drove into the country a short distance, driving slowly to conserve gasoline and pass the time. He was ringing Dickson’s doorbell at nine sharp.\n\nTwo and a half hours were taken up with Willets explaining details of the work, then the engineer took his leave. Dickson and Clinsey were alone in the apartment. Dickson brought out a bottle of old wine and two glasses. He poured Clinsey a drink, then himself one. Outside the little town grew quiet as its citizens went off to bed. At midnight Clinsey rose as if to take his leave. Dickson went with him as far as the reception hall.\n\n“I’m alone here most of the time, Mr. Clinsey,” Dickson said. “Any evening you feel like stopping in for a visit, do so.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Clinsey. He was thinking of Baldy Clark then, glad that it was raining. The wet weather would probably keep Clark off the prowl. He reached for the doorknob, then turned quickly to face Dickson. A snub-nosed automatic was in his hand, its snout leveled at Dickson’s face,\n\nDickson paled, his mouth sagged. “Why, Mr. Clinsey, I — ”\n\nClinsey’s face was changing to an evil thing. Sight of its transformation clogged the words in Dickson’s throat.\n\n“We’re going to have a little game of cards, Dickson,” Clinsey said. The deck of deuces was in his left hand. “You’re to have the honor of first cut, low man loses. Loses his life, Dickson!”\n\nDickson stared at the cards, his face paper white. He made no effort to speak.\n\n“You stood the expense of arranging this deck, Dickson,” Clinsey said. “You bought thirteen packs to get fifty-two deuces, because you and your slimy friends couldn’t take a chance on anybody else having to kill Henry Browne, president of the Browne Construction Company, except Happy Charley Tage.”\n\nDickson said nothing, but his lips began trembling as if he wanted to speak. He looked Clinsey straight in the eyes, stark fear filling his own.\n\n“Browne found out about the rotten concrete you and the directors, Brebaker, Kuttering, and LeFrage, meant to put into the university job. He knew it was loaded with sand. He knew if it went into the university stadium that someday it would crumble, mash out maybe thousands of lives. So you brought in your greenhorn engineer, a boy named Charley Tage, who wasn’t too nice to turn a crooked dollar, and who had more guts than brains. You five cut cards, low man to kill President Browne.”\n\nClinsey paused to lick his drying lips. He was smiling grimly. “So you fixed a deck of deuces. LeFrage thought of it. You prepared the deck. Then you four rats extended Happy Charley the honor of first cut. After he turned up a deuce, what need was there for anybody else to cut for a lower card ? Then when Happy Charley killed Browne you four double-crossers thought him too dangerous to your safety to be left alive. So you framed him, and the state hanged him.\n\nClinsey drew a quick breath, licked his lips again. He was holding out the deck of deuces toward Dickson, inching them closer and closer.\n\n“But you slipped up twice, you four wise men! Once when you didn’t destroy this deck. Again when you figured Happy Charley to be a man without friends. Because I was Happy Charley’s friend. We went to the same engineering school together. We were like brothers.”\n\nFor a moment Clinsey’s eyes clouded over, then a fiendish expression struck in them.\n\n“Cut, you coward!” he said. “Cut a deuce, you dog! And take what has been coming to you for ten years. Your pretty lies won Happy Charley’s widow for you, but you don’t have her to shield you now. Cut, Dickson, and lose your life!” Words came from Dickson at last. He whispered, “You are the Black Butcher. I thought Clark was — ”\n\nClinsey pushed the cards close, touching Dickson’s chest with them. “Cut. Dickson!” he hissed.\n\nBut Dickson didn’t touch them. He went into lightning action, smashing out with his right fist.\n\nHe missed Clinsey’s chin, but crashed his shoulder. The gun flew from the Black Butcher’s hand. The cards went scattering. Dickson smashed out again and missed. Clinsey caught him with a well-aimed right, his knuckles crunching the jawbone. Dickson’s eyes blanked.\n\nIn a flash Clinsey was on him, the black butcher knife in his hand.\n\n“Wait a minute, Mr. Clinsey!” said Baldy Clark from the hall door. “Wait! Drop that knife or I’ll have to blow your brains out!” He was smiling his cherubic smile, his eyes sparkling merrily.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nSomething Familiar\n\nClinsey dropped the knife and stood up from Dickson’s prone body, glancing at the police positive in Clark’s right hand — a hand that was solid and businesslike.\n\n“You do get around, don’t you, Mr. Clark?” he said.\n\n“Everything was too quiet. I couldn’t sleep,” said Clark.\n\nClinsey was tense, alert, as he said, “For the fool you look, you’re quite an efficient policeman.”\n\n“Not so efficient as you might think,” said Clark. “I’ve been almost nine years working to find out what you just told me in a couple of minutes. I knew all along Charley Tage didn’t work solo in the Browne killing, but I couldn’t prove a thing. Now with what you just told me the county prosecuting attorney and I will hang Dickson.”\n\n“Hang — Dickson?” Clinsey wasn’t believing what he heard. He stared his doubt at Clark.\n\n“That’s what I said. What do yon think I came to this town for — my health? Listen, Clinsey, I’ve got the sweetest little private sleuthing business built up in Kansas City you ever heard of. I came here and worked like sixty to get to be a policeman just for one reason. Happy Charley Tage was my brother.” The smile left Clark’s face. For a minute it was sad and a little tired.\n\n“You — Happy Charley’s brother!” Clinsey was surprised, but he knew now that something familiar about Clark’s face when he wasn’t smiling.\n\n“I knew you were the Black Butcher the minute I saw you at the post office opening your box so easily,” said Clark, the smile returning to lighten his face,\n\n“How?” Then he had slipped up … then there had been direction behind Clark’s annoying interferences …\n\n“The postmaster rented you Mr. Kuttering’s old box. He didn’t notice doing it, but I took account of it. The first time you worked its combination, you did it without a hitch, just like you’d worked it a hundred times. And you had, remember? When you were over here before, collecting the dope on Dickson and his friends, you used to rifle Kuttering’s post box? It was in the records that you did, anyway.”\n\nClinsey nodded. Yes, he had learned the combination of Kuttering’s box ten years ago. But —\n\nClark answered his puzzled frown. “They’ve made some changes in the furniture down at the post office. The tiers of boxes have been moved. That’s why you didn’t recognize the box as the one Kuttering used to rent.” Clark’s smile broadened as he continued, “Then the way you roll your gum before chewing it. A roll of gum like that was found near Brebaker’s corpse. It’s in the records.” “That’s why you gave me gum as a token of welcome?” asked Clinsey.\n\n“Yes. I wanted to see what you’d do with it. I let you ruin a deck of cards for me for the same reason.”\n\n“Ruin a deck of cards for you?”\n\n“Yes. You have an ugly way of scarring the ends of cards when you deal. You’ve no doubt noticed yourself doing it. You do it with your thumbnail — like the Black Butcher did with the deck the night he played cards with Simon LeFrage before killing him.”\n\n“You’re smart, Clark,” admitted Clinsey. “But having the same blood in your veins as Happy Charley you’d have to be. So, I hate to — ” He flung himself at Clark, ducking under the gun, butting his head into thd3 police chief’s chest. Clark went down.\n\nClinsey was on him like a tiger, tearing the gun from his hand. “I can’t kill you — not Happy Charley’s brother, but — ” He picked up the black butcher knife, keeping Clark covered with the police positive. “You can see a demonstration of how I — ”\n\nSuddenly Dickson rolled over, snatched a gun from his coat pocket, and shot Clinsey in the back of the head. It was evident by his ability to act so quickly and accurately that he had been playing possum. He swung the snout of the gun, still smoking, in line with Clark’s heart “I’m going to kill you, you little meddler,” he said hoarsely.\n\nClinsey used the last of his ebbing strength to kick the gun from Dickson’s hand just as it went off. In the next instant, Clark leaped forward and his fist crashed Dickson’s face. The construction boss went out for the second time.\n\nClark used the telephone on the hallstand to summon, a doctor, but Clinsey died before the medico arrived. He died in the arms of Happy Charley’s brother, Clark “Baldy” Tage, Kansas City detective.\n\nHis last words were said with a smile, “You’ve got plenty of evidence to hang Saul Dickson, Clark, and I know you will.” Then, weakly, “You’re smart, Baldy. But not as smart as your brother, Happy Charley. The difference is you’re honest-smart, and that’s not being just smart. That’s being truly wise.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

It streamed from the sky at an angle, and caused\nColonel Graham to jump to his feet and close the windows. He smiled as\nhe returned to his guest.\n\n“Rain at last, Hawke!” he said. “This will make the farmers happy. The\nground has been fairly parched.”\n\n“And it will cool the air and make a good night’s sleep possible,” Dixon\nHawke remarked. He yawned and glanced at the clock. “Eleven-thirty! By\nJove, how the time passes when one talks about old times!”\n\nThe criminologist puffed reflectively at his pipe. He had been invited\nto Bambourne to spend a long weekend with his old friend, Colonel\nGraham.\n\nAfter a final nightcap Hawke and the Colonel prepared to go to bed, but\nwere startled by the sharp ringing of the front door bell.\n\nThe servants had already retired, and the Colonel opened the door\nhimself. The village constable stepped into the hall, shaking the rain\nfrom his cape.\n\nThere was a brief conversation between the officer and Colonel Graham,\nwho was justice of the peace for the district.\n\n“Hawke!” the criminologist’s host called out. “Here’s a nasty business.\nConstable Sanders has just found a dead man up the lane! He says his\nhead has been smashed in, and it looks like murder. Do you want to\ncome?”\n\nHawke agreed to go, and they slipped into mackintoshes and followed the\npolice officer out of the house. He led them to a narrow lane a few\nhundred yards from the gates, and shone his torch on the body of a man\nsprawling on the wet ground. Hawke knelt and made a swift examination.\n\nHe discovered bruises on the man’s face, but they were minor injuries\ncompared with the dreadful wound on the side of the head. Hawke looked\nat the colonel and nodded.\n\n“No accident,” he said. “There was some sort of fight, and the poor\nfellow was knocked down. He was struck with a blunt weapon as he tried\nto rise. There’s still warmth in the body, so he must have been alive\nabout half an hour ago. The constable is right. It’s a case of murder!\n\n“Do you know him?” asked the criminologist, after a pause.\n\n“Not from Adam. We’d better go through his pockets.”\n\nThe man’s clothes were rather shabby. They turned out the pockets\ncarefully. There were several letters addressed to Mr. William Cargill\nat a London post office. The initials “W. C.” were on a fob hanging from\nthe watch-chain of the dead man, so his identity was established.\n\nColonel Graham read the letters by the light of the constable’s torch.\nHe looked very grim as he passed them to the criminologist.\n\n“They’re from a local fellow,” ho said. “Do you remember Jim Thornton\nwho lives in a cottage near the church? A mysterious sort of chap who’s\nbeen here some years, but keeps to himself. Must have a small private\nincome.\n\n“Well, judging by these letters, Cargill was blackmailing him. Read this\nnote. It was in an envelope with yesterday’s postmark, Hawke.”\n\nThe criminologist read it carefully.\n\nThornton had written: “I will meet you between eleven and midnight near\nthe stile in Butt’s Lane. You’ll have the money, but it’s the last I’ll\never give you. You’ve bled me white, you rat! They ought to kill things\nlike you!”\n\nHawke could well guess what had happened.\n\nCargill had made some fresh demand, and Thornton had just lost his\ntemper. He had knocked the blackmailer down and struck him with a stick.\n\nIn silence the three men lifted the body and carried it to a shed on the\ncolonel’s property. Hawke got his car out, and they drove up to the\nvillage.\n\nThe constable pointed to a lighted window in a house near the church.\nThey stopped the car and watched the shadow of a man’s figure crossing\nand recrossing the window as he walked up and down the room. Colonel\nGraham sighed and led the way up the path. He felt pity for Thornton,\nand hesitated before he knocked.\n\nA minute passed before the man came down. He was tall and thin, and his\nhair was prematurely grey. There was a cut on one cheek, and his left\neye was swollen. The blackmailer had apparently put up a fight.\n\n“Thornton,” the colonel said, “I’m confoundedly sorry to be here on this\nmission. Did you meet somebody in Butt’s Lane a short time ago?”\n\n“I did! ” Thornton’s eyes flashed. “So he had the nerve to complain to\nyou? Well, I’m not afraid. He was blackmailing me! He—”\n\n“He’s dead! ” Colonel Graham said grimly.\n\n“Dead? But he was alive when I left. I knocked him down after I’d given\nhim the two hundred pounds he demanded from me! He’s not dead! ”\n\n“In the heat of your temper you didn’t know what you did. You struck him\nso violently with your stick that you killed him. Will you go quietly\nwith the officer?”\n\n&amp;lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&amp;gt;Back to Top&amp;lt;/h6&amp;gt;\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Poacher’s Evidence\n\nDixon Hawke did not see Colonel Graham until lunch the next day. The\nColonel had been busy with the police superintendent who had come to\ntake charge of the case. Formal evidence of arrest was to be given\nagainst Thornton that afternoon.\n\n“It’s a clear case,” said the Colonel to Hawke. “We’ve got a witness who\nsaw them together—Tom Mason, who prowls about a lot at night.”\n\n“Ah! The poacher!”\n\n“Yes. He happened to pass the lane and saw Thornton and Cargill\ntogether. They were shouting at one another. According to Mason, it was\nthen about eleven o’clock, for he got home shortly after that hour. He\nlives with old Sam Dill, his uncle, at Millstream Cottage.”\n\n“So that clinches the case?”\n\n“I’m afraid so. One curious point. Thornton swears he gave the\nblackmailer two hundred pounds in small notes. As you know, there was\nlittle money on him—a handful of silver, if I remember rightly. We’ve\nchecked with Thornton’s bank, and it’s quite true he drew the money.\nWe’ve searched his house, but can’t find it. Thornton also claims that\nit was nearly eleven-thirty when he met Cargill, and that Mason couldn’t\nhave seen them.”\n\n“Mason may have been mistaken about the time.”\n\n“Oh, no! His uncle let him in when he came home. He had to knock him up\nbecause he’d forgotten his key. It was then eleven o’clock, according to\nold Sam.”\n\nAfter lunch the Colonel hurried away to take his place on the Bench for\nthe brief appearance of the prisoner.\n\n&amp;lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&amp;gt;Back to Top&amp;lt;/h6&amp;gt;\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nQueer Behaviour of a Clock\n\nThere were one or two points about the case which puzzled Hawke despite\nits apparent clearness, and later that afternoon he dropped in for a\nchat with old Sam, with whom he had become acquainted on a previous\nvisit.\n\nHawke found the old fellow standing on a chair glaring at the face of a\ngrandfather clock.\n\n“Dang thing’s gone daft! ” he grumbled. “Never known it do a thing like\nthis before! ”\n\n“It’s rather an old clock, Sam.”\n\n“Not more’n a hundred years, sir, and what’s that for one o’ they\nclocks? Time’s perfect, right to the second by the wireless. But\nstriking! Well, you listen to it! ”\n\nThe minute hand was nearing the ten-past three mark when the deep notes\nof the chime rang out. Hawke counted them. The clock had struck four.\n\n“Dang silly thing! ” muttered old Sam. “Striking four at ten past\nthree!” Dixon Hawke laughed. “You’ll have to get a watchmaker to it,” he\nsaid. “By the way, Sam, that was a nasty business last night, wasn’t\nit?”\n\n“It was that, sir. And me nephew saw them at it. He’s gone to court to\ngive evidence now. Wish he weren’t coming back! ”\n\n“Why do you say that?” asked the criminologist.\n\n“Well, it’s hard for a chap with my small pension to have to keep the\nlikes of him. Not a stroke of work will he do! And even when it comes to\npicking up an occasional rabbit, he ain’t smart like I used to be.\nBesides, I don’t hold with a young ’un coming in late and getting an old\nman like me out of bed to open the door.”\n\n“Does Sam make a habit of that?”\n\n“He has a key, but last night he forgot it. Banged about and yelled\nuntil I woke up and came down. We had a rare set-to and I put him in his\nplace proper. Told him all honest folks’ doors should be locked before\neleven o’clock.”\n\n“So it was eleven when he came home?”\n\n“He pointed that out to me. Fair cheeky he was. Old clock began to\nstrike when we were a-shouting, so it must have been running all right\nthen. And him standing there with the rain dripping from his hat and\na-telling me—“\n\n“Rain?” exclaimed Dixon Hawke.\n\n“Cats-and-dogs outside, sir! ” Hawke was staring at the grandfather\nclock with considerable interest.\n\n“How long after Tom came in did you stay up?” he asked abruptly.\n\n“About five or six minutes. He calmed down and said he’d lock up, so I\nwent back to bed.”\n\n“I hope he won’t upset your sleep again, Sam. By the way, when he came\nin and the clock struck, did you count the chimes?”\n\n“The argument was too ’eated for me to do that, sir.”\n\nShortly after Hawke left the cottage, and when he was outside, he\nglanced at his watch. He walked briskly to Butt’s Lane and looked at his\nwatch again. Hawke’s expression was grim as he hurried to Colonel\nGraham’s house and got his car out of the garage.\n\nHe drove down to the village and stopped at the Memorial Hall, which was\nalso used as a courthouse. A crowd of people stood outside the door.\nHawke whispered to the constable on duty and went in, finding himself a\nseat at the back of the hall.\n\nThe proceedings were very informal, the prisoner standing before a long\ntable where the magistrates were sitting. Superintendent Moss was\npresenting the police case, asking for Thornton to be committed to the\nAssizes.\n\n&amp;lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&amp;gt;Back to Top&amp;lt;/h6&amp;gt;\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nHawke Asks Some Questions\n\nThe cold facts lined up by the officer left the prisoner in a hopeless\nposition. It was proved that he had been blackmailed by the murdered man\nfor several years, and that he had paid out until his capital had almost\ngone.\n\nThe superintendent explained how the two men had met in the lane; how,\non the prisoner’s own admission, they had quarrelled and Cargill had\nbeen knocked down. When the officer stated that Thornton had struck him\nwith a stick as he tried to rise, the prisoner interrupted for the first\ntime.\n\n“That’s a lie! ” he shouted. “I tell you, Cargill was sitting up when I\nleft! I did not kill him!”\n\n“I have one witness to prove there was a quarrel,” the superintendent\nwent on. “Step up, Mason.”\n\nA big man came up to the table and took the oath in a mumbling voice.\nOld Sam’s nephew was shifty-eyed and surly, and looked rather\nfrightened.\n\nHe told how he had been returning home about eleven and had passed\nButt’s Lane. Loud voices had caused him to look round, and he saw\nThornton and the dead man standing close together. The prisoner had been\nin a violent mood.\n\nAt the back of the court Dixon Hawke was scribbling on a piece of paper,\nwhich he sent up to the Bench. Colonel Graham passed it to his fellow\nmagistrates, and after a whispered conversation with the superintendent,\nHawke was called.\n\n“Mason,” Hawke said. “You got home at eleven?”\n\n“Clock was striking when Uncle let me in. That’s proof, ain’t it?”\n\n“Was it raining?”\n\n“Might ha’ been.”\n\n“Your uncle says it was raining hard and there was thunder. Now, I\nremember when it began to rain, Mason, and so does Colonel Graham. It\nwas exactly eleven-thirty when the first roll of thunder started the\ndownpour!\n\n“There was no rain at eleven,” Hawke said, “so you did not come in at\nthat hour! ”\n\n“That’s a lie! My uncle can prove it! He knows it was eleven. That clock\nof his ain’t never lost a minute, and you can go down and look at it\nnow!”\n\n“I have already done so. It’s accurate—but it strikes an hour in advance\nof the proper time, and at ten minutes past the hour, mark that! Do you\nknow what that means? It means the clock was put back as it was about to\nstrike midnight! The chiming mechanism runs independently, and moving\nback the hands won’t make it change.”\n\n&amp;lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&amp;gt;Back to Top&amp;lt;/h6&amp;gt;\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n“Sensation in Court”\n\nThere was a long silence. The prisoner had lifted his head and was\nstaring at Hawke. Superintendent Moss was frowning. When he spoke, there\nwas a note of surprise in his voice.\n\n“Are you suggesting that the witness tampered with the dock?” he\ndemanded.\n\n“I am!” Hawke replied. “He claims he had forgotten his key and had to\nknock up his uncle to enter. But it is my belief that he entered the\nhouse secretly just before midnight and moved the clock back an hour.\nThen he went outside and knocked for Sam Dill to let him in. He\ndeliberately made a scene with the old man and drew his attention to the\ntime.\n\n“When Dill went to bed, Mason put the clock on to the proper time! ”\nHawke continued. “The hand had to go past the hour mark again, and, as\ntwelve had already been struck when the hands were pointing at eleven,\nit struck one — when the hands were pointing at ten minutes past twelve!\n” Hawke turned to the witness and rapped a single question. “Why did you\ntry to make an alibi for yourself?”\n\n“I—I—what be you trying to do?”\n\n“I’ve proved you were out at midnight, that you did not see the start of\nthe quarrel between Thornton and Cargill, but the end of it. You saw the\nprisoner go away after knocking the other man down!\n\n“Mason, I’ll tell you what happened last night. You were poaching near\nButt’s Lane, and you saw the two men together. You saw Thornton pass\nover a roll of money. You saw the quarrel and the dead man knocked down.\nThornton went away and you thought Cargill was stunned. The money was\ntoo much of a temptation. You bent over him to take it. He surprised you\nby starting to get up. In your hand was a cudgel you used for killing\nrabbits. You struck him with it and stole the money.\n\n“Then you ran home and fixed that alibi. You thought you were cunning,\nbut you were very stupid. If you hadn’t tampered with the clock and\nroused your uncle, you would never have been suspected! ”\n\nA shriek of rage came from Mason. He dived a hand into the deep pocket\nof his coat and pulled out a short but wicked-looking club. He sprang\nforward and rushed at Hawke viciously, catching him a glancing blow\nwhich caused him to fall to his knees.\n\n“I’ll kill you! ” yelled Mason.\n\nThe attack had been made with such suddenness that everyone was too\nstartled to move, and the club was lifting for another blow when the\nprisoner suddenly went into action. He flung himself forward and the two\nrolled to the floor, clinging to one another and fighting desperately.\n\nThe superintendent and the village constable made a rush, and between\nthem they separated the pair. Handcuffs clicked, and Mason, still\nscreaming with rage, was forced into a chair.\n\nDixon Hawke rose to his feet and smiled grimly as he felt the bruise on\nhis head.\n\nThen he bent and picked up the cudgel. He examined it carefully before\ngiving it to Superintendent Moss.\n\n“It has been washed,” he said. “However, a laboratory test will surely\nshow traces of blood and hair. This is the weapon that killed Cargill! ”\n\n“And here’s the money, sir! ” interrupted the constable, who had been\nsearching Mason. “It was tucked away in the lining of his coat. It will\ntake more than an alibi to explain that away!”\n\n***\n\nSome time later Dixon Hawke, his head bandaged, was sitting in a\ncomfortable chair at Colonel Graham’s house. Thornton, cleared of the\ndreadful charge, was opposite him. There was a look of contentment on\nhis haggard face.\n\n“And now I’m free,” he said. “Free from everything! It’s all thanks to\nyou, Mr. Hawke! ”\n\n“You can thank last night ’s storm! ” the criminologist said.\n\n“Storm?”\n\n“If it hadn’t rained at exactly eleven-thirty, I would never have\ndoubted Mason’s claim that he was home at eleven. And if I hadn’t\ndoubted that I would never have given a second thought to the strange\nbehaviour of Sam Dill’s dock!”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

An audible gasp went up from the well-dressed crowd around the crap-table. They had seen Corcoran make six straight passes; watched him run a ten-spot up to six hundred and forty bucks.\n\nThen, since there was no limit in Spot Shelton’s ultra-select gambling establishment, Corcoran had shot the works.\n\nAnd lost.\n\nLoudly the girl alongside him said: “You were foolish, honey. You should have dragged down.”\n\nHer name was Margie Zaine. She wore her blue-black hair sleekly coiffed; she had a Madonna face. Her figure was a poem of curves sheathed in a crimson satin evening gown. Men had a hard time keeping their eyes away from her.\n\nShe was a capper for Spot Shelton’s place. Sucker-bait. But Corcoran was no sucker. He was a private dick.\n\nHe grinned down into her dark eyes. She was playing her part to perfection. Nobody on Spot Shelton’s staff would possibly suspect her of disloyalty to Shelton tonight … .\n\nNor could anybody guess what Corcoran was really up to. Thus far he’d played his part of a reckless sap to the hilt.\n\nBut it had been a tough job trying to make the dice obey orders.\n\nLuck’s a fickle jade; when a man wants to lose, he almost invariably wins. It had taken him more than ten minutes to go broke.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Teller At My Bank\n\nThe tuxedoed croupier said: “Still your dice if you want them, Mister.”\n\nMargie Zaine pressed herself closer to Corcoran. She was trembling a little.\n\nAt the far end of the table a tall, nervous young man flashed a veiled glance at the private dick; flicked his eyebrows. Corcoran took his cue.\n\nHe said to the croupier: “I’d like to keep on shooting, but I’m cleaned.” He passed the cubes to the player on his right. Then he said: “Could I get a check cashed?”\n\nUp at the end of the table, the tall young man was listening to a willowy blonde in daring décolletage. He seemed annoyed. The blonde looked sore. The croupier beckoned an attendant.\n\nThe attendant came up to Corcoran and said: “How large a check, sir?”\n\n“Oh, about five hundred.” Corcoran drew a checkbook from his dinner jacket pocket. He didn’t produce the flat .25 automatic which also reposed in that pocket. The attendant frowned dubiously.\n\n“I’m afraid I’ll have to let Mr. Shelton pass on that, sir. It’s more than I’m authorized to cash. I’ll take you to his office.”\n\nMargie Zaine said: “Never mind. I’ll show the way.” She looked archly at Corcoran. “I know Spot Shelton. I’ll introduce you. Come along, honey.”\n\nThat was a chuckle, of course, Margie knew Shelton. She worked for him! But she wouldn’t be working for him after tonight. Corcoran slipped an arm around her waist. She led him out of the casino-room and down a long, carpeted corridor. She knocked on a closed door.\n\nA voice said: “Come in.” It was Spot Shelton’s voice, sleek and purring.\n\nThey entered. Margie said: “Hello, Spot. This is my friend, Mr. Jones. He wants a check cashed.”\n\nShelton’s eyes were heavy-lidded and crafty to match the thin gash of his avaricious mouth.\n\n“Glad to accommodate you,” he said affably. “How much will you need?”\n\nCorcoran raised his ante. “A thousand will do.”\n\nLike a light turned off, Shelton’s smile faded abruptly. “A thousand?” he said sharply.\n\n“Sure,” Corcoran said, “I’ve got plenty in the bank. Want proof?”\n\n“What kind of proof?” Shelton purred.\n\nCorcoran nodded.\n\n“Send for Harry Greer. He’s out at the dice-table. I just saw him. He’s a teller at my bank. He knows the balance I carry. Call him in. Ask him.”\n\nShelton spoke into a house-phone.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nYou Might Call It A Stick-Up\n\nIn a moment the door opened. A tall, nervous young man came in, the one who had flicked his eyebrow at Corcoran a while ago.\n\nHe said: “Why, hello, Margie. Good evening, Mr. Jones,” he added politely to Corcoran. Then he looked at Shelton. “You want me?”\n\nCorcoran said: “He wants to know how much money I’ve got on deposit in your bank, Harry. Tell him.”\n\nGreer cleared his throat; it was his only sign of uneasiness. “Why, more than thirty thousand dollars, roughly speaking.”\n\n“Ah,” Shelton smiled apologetically to Corcoran. “In that case I’ll be delighted to cash your check, Mr. Jones.”\n\nHe went to the wall behind his elaborate desk, shoved aside an etching, and toyed with the dial of a counter-sunk safe. A big yellow solitaire diamond glittered on the ring finger of his right hand as he opened the safe’s circular door.\n\nCorcoran pulled out his .25 automatic and said: “Thanks, Shelton. Now step back and sit down before I blast you.”\n\nThe gambler whirled, his sallow cheeks pale. “What is this?”\n\n“You might call it a stick-up,” Corcoran said. “But I’d sooner say it’s a bit of justice outside the law. I’m not a hood. Just a private shamus working for Harry Greer and Miss Zaine.”\n\n“Why, you dirty — !”\n\nCorcoran said: “Tie him to the chair, Harry. And Margie, you grab the dough out of the box. Just thirty grand.”\n\n“Thirty grand — ?” Shelton snarled an oath at the girl. “You double-crossing vixen!”\n\nGreer slugged him in the teeth. The gambler sagged into his chair.\n\nGreer produced a skein of picture-wire, and bound Shelton’s wrists and ankles, saying: “Maybe Margie used to be a double-crosser. But not any more. She’s all through capping for you, Shelton.”\n\nMargie was pulling packets of currency out of the safe, stuffing them into her beaded purse.\n\nGreer went on: “She got me to play your crooked games, Shelton. But you didn’t count on her falling for me, did you? Well, that’s what happened.”\n\n“Falling for you? That’s a laugh, you dirty — ”\n\nGreer said: “I’m marrying Margie, see? That’s why I hired this detective to help me get back the thirty thousand dollars you took away from me with your loaded dice. Now I can put back what I took from the bank — before the auditors catch up with me. And from now on, Margie and I are going straight.”\n\nThe gambler squirmed helplessly.\n\nTo Margie he snarled: “Don’t be a sap, kid! Greer’s playing you for a sucker. He won’t marry you. Look what he did to Jackie Allan. Made her fall for him, too, then handed her the air. He’ll treat you the same way! Put that dough back, baby — and I’ll forget the whole thing.”\n\nHe added: “You can keep out five hundred if you want to. That’s all Greer ever lost to me, the lousy liar. He never dropped any thirty grand!”\n\n“I don’t believe you, Spot,” Margie said quietly. She snapped her purse shut. It bulged with the currency.\n\nShelton raged: “You put that dough back in the safe or I’ll get you if it’s the last thing I ever do!”\n\nGreer hit him on the jaw again. The gambler sagged against his bonds, unconscious. Greer went over to him to make sure the wires were tightly knotted.\n\nHe said: “Okay. He won’t get loose for a while.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nCould I Kiss The Bride?\n\nThe door opened. A feminine voice said: “That’s what you think.”\n\nIt was the willowy blonde who had approached Greer at the crap-table.\n\nGreer said: “Jackie Allan — !” in a scared whisper.\n\nIn spite of her heavy make-up she was gorgeous. Her hair was spun gold. She said: “I told you I’d get even with you for handing me the gate, Harry. I warned you I’d get something on you.”\n\nGreer sputtered: “You — you — !”\n\n“Take it easy, Harry,” she said frigidly. “And put that money back where it belongs. Spot Shelton was plenty decent to me after you walked out on me. This is my chance to make it up to him. You put that money back, or I’ll scream the place down.”\n\nCorcoran went into action. He jumped at the blonde and slapped a muffling hand over her mouth. He looked at Greer.\n\n“What about this, Harry?”\n\n“A pack of lies!” the bank-teller said harshly, indignantly. “It’s true I was nuts about her for a while. She was the one who first got me into playing Shelton’s crooked games. When I found out she was one of his come-ons, I ditched her. Then I fell in love with Margie, here. Margie came clean with me; promised to help me get my money back from Shelton … ”\n\n“Okay. Hand me that picture-wire,” Corcoran snapped. He took the skein, tripped Jackie Allan to the floor, tied her. When he got through, she was gagged with a handkerchief and trussed like a turkey.\n\nCorcoran got up.\n\nTo Greer he said: “Get your coat and hat and go home. Margie and I will phone you from her apartment, later. We’ll leave shortly. It wouldn’t look good for all of us to be seen pulling out of this joint together.”\n\nWhen Corcoran and Margie strolled casually back into the gaming-room a little later, Greer was gone. Corcoran stopped at the roulette-table long enough to lose the fifty that Margie had slipped him. That was to make everything look okay. After all, he was supposed to have cashed a check … .\n\nAfter four wrong guesses at the wheel, he yawned.\n\n“Let’s beat it, Margie. I’m tired,” he said loudly.\n\nShe fastened herself to his arm. They went out; found a taxi. They headed for her apartment.\n\n“You were swell,” she said. “Now Harry and I can be married, and — ”\n\n“Could I kiss the bride?”\n\nShe gave him her lips in gratitude.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nAnd Finally, Silence\n\nThe cab stopped in front of her apartment building.\n\nThey went into the lobby. It was deserted and dimly lighted at this late hour. They made for the automatic elevator.\n\nFrom a curtained alcove to the left, a hand appeared. It was a white, soft-looking hand wearing a yellow diamond solitaire and holding a revolver.\n\nAs the gun crashed, Margie Zaine screamed and clutched at her breast. Blood spurted through her fingers. She dropped her handbag and fell.\n\nCorcoran made a grab for his automatic. He fired at the drapes. He knew he must have missed, because there was no answering fire.\n\nBellowing, the private dick smashed toward the curtained alcove. As he hit the drapes, something thunked down on his head. He was stunned. Fireworks exploded inside his brain. He reeled drunkenly; pitched to his knees.\n\nBy the time he got up again, the alcove was empty. There was a doorway leading to the alley alongside the building. The door was open … .\n\nCorcoran stared stupidly at Margie Zaine’s sprawled form. Death’s waxen mist was on her Madonna face. Her handbag was open and empty. The money she had taken from Spot Shelton’s office wall-safe was now gone.\n\nShelton, who had threatened her … Shelton, who had worn a yellow solitaire diamond on the ring finger of his white, effeminate hand … !\n\nCorcoran snapped out of his daze. He was thinking of Harry Greer, now. Maybe the bank-teller would be next on Shelton’s list of victims. Maybe it was already too late —\n\nSprinting out into the night, Corcoran grabbed a passing owl cab. It zipped him to Greer’s apartment house, an unpretentious three-story structure with exterior fire- escapes marring its old-fashioned red brick façade.\n\nCorcoran raced up to the second floor. He reached the bank-teller’s door and pounded on it.\n\n“Greer — let me in! It’s me, Corcoran — and hell’s to pay!” A muffled pistol-shot answered him. Then a heavy thump, as of a body falling. And finally, silence.\n\nCorcoran hit the door. It bruisingly rebuffed him. He backed away and smashed at it again, putting his full two hundred pounds behind the impact. This time the portal gave way. He stumbled into the room.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nPinched For Murder\n\nAn open window framed the iron fire-ladder just outside. In the room’s center lay Harry Greer, breathing heavily, with his eyes closed. Thick clotted blood wept from a raw hole in his left shoulder. A thin drift of gunpowder-smoke eddied in the dull light from a table-lamp.\n\nCorcoran ran heavily to the window; stared outward, downward. He couldn’t see anybody. He returned to Greer and worked over him. At last the teller opened his eyes. “God … my shoulder … !” he groaned faintly. “Who drilled you? Was it Shelton?”\n\n“I … don’t know! I was … getting ready to … start for Margie’s place … and a shot … came from … the window … .”\n\nGreer sat up weakly. “What are you … doing here? My God … if Shelton shot me … he may go … gunning for Margie … You should have … stayed with her … .”\n\n“I’m sorry, kid, but Margie — Margie’s dead.” Corcoran tried to break the news to him gently. “‘Take it easy while I try to do something to fix this shoulder of yours.”\n\n“Margie … dead … ?”\n\nThe teller pushed Corcoran away. “Do something … .!” he cried hysterically. “Call the cops … trail that dirty rat … get him … kill him … !”\n\nHis lips twisted vengefully.\n\nCorcoran said: “Yeah. Trail Shelton. That’s a large order. He’ll be on the lam for sure, now. He must’ve got loose in his office; reached Margie’s place ahead of us. Then he blasted.He killed her — and thought he killed me, too. So he came here to bump you. But just as he fired at you from the window, he heard my voice out in the hall. He realized he hadn’t croaked me. And now he knows he’s in the soup; knows my testimony will convict him. He’ll go into hiding.”\n\n“You’ve got to find him!” Greer sobbed. “Get going! I’ll phone the cops. Move, blast you!”\n\nCorcoran went out. It was going to be tough, trying to locate Spot Shelton. Corcoran didn’t know where to start. Then he got an idea. He found a drugstore and a phone book. He looked up Jackie Allan’s name and found it. He made a note of her address.\n\nA taxi took him to a bungalow court. He rang her bell. When she opened the door, Corcoran drew his automatic and shoved the muzzle against her.\n\nHe said: “You’re pinched for murder, baby.”\n\nShe was wearing lounging pajamas. Her wrists were red and chafed from the wire with which she’d been trussed back in Shelton’s office. There were marks on her ankles, too. The ankles themselves were slender and dainty, to match the rest of her.\n\nShe said: “Pinched … for murder? What do you m-mean?”\n\nHe backed her into the little living room and kicked the door shut behind him. He pushed her onto the divan and stood over her, glowering.\n\n“What happened after I left Shelton’s joint?”\n\n“Why — why — I managed to spit that gag out of my mouth. I yelled for help. People came in and untied me and Shelton, too. Spot brought me home.”\n\nCorcoran said: “Straight home?”\n\n“Yes.” She seemed puzzled.\n\nHe said: “You’re a liar, baby. You hated Harry Greer’s guts because he ditched you. You hated Margie Zaine for taking him away from you. So you gunned the both of them, to get even.”\n\nIt was preposterous, of course. Corcoran knew that. But he wanted to throw a scare into Jackie Allan.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nTo Save A Guy’s Life\n\nAll the color drained from her cheeks.\n\n“I — I don’t know what you’re talking about!” she said.\n\n“Margie’s dead. You killed her. You tried to kill me. And you put a bullet through Harry Greer’s shoulder.”\n\n“I — I didn’t! My God, I wouldn’t — ” She reached up and grabbed his gun-arm. “D-don’t point that thing at me. And you can’t believe I’d — ”\n\nHe looked at her, steadily.\n\n“There’s just one way you can buy yourself out of this mess, baby. I want you to tell me where I can find Shelton.”\n\nFrom the hallway, a voice growled: “That’s easy, snoop. Here I am. And this thing in my hand isn’t a saxophone. It’s a rod. It shoots bullets.”\n\nCorcoran said: “How did you get in here?”\n\n“I’ve got a key,” Shelton said. “Why not?”\n\n“You’ll be getting a key to the hot squat before long,” Corcoran said.\n\n“I gathered that. I was home listening to the radio when I heard a bleat go out for me on a murder rap. That’s why I’m here now.” He looked at the blonde girl. “Why did you kill Margie, babe?”\n\n“But I didn’t — I didn’t! That’s what I was trying to tell this copper — ”\n\n“That’s okay. I understand the setup.” The gambler glared at Corcoran. “You’re not arresting her, snoop. I won’t let you.”\n\nShelton shifted his gun to his left hand, doubled his right. He hit Corcoran on the button.\n\nTwice. Hard.\n\nCorcoran’s knees buckled. He took the count.\n\nWhen he awoke, Shelton and Jackie were gone. The house was all upset, as if a hurried job of luggage packing had been accomplished during the private detective’s unconsciousness. Corcoran felt his bruised jaw. The flesh wasn’t cut.\n\nHe stumbled out of the cottage. He walked four blocks before he found a cab. He gave the driver Greer’s address.\n\n“And step on it — to save a guy’s life!” he panted. Seven minutes later he burst into Greer’s apartment.\n\nGreer had contrived to bandage his nicked shoulder. He stared at Corcoran.\n\n“What — ?”\n\n“Shelton’s still on the loose. He’s got a gun. He may be on his way here to finish you!” Corcoran said. “But we’ll trap him.”\n\n“H-how?”\n\n“Have you got a roscoe? He took mine.”\n\nGreer opened a desk drawer. He brought out a revolver. Corcoran snatched it and jammed it three inches into the bank-teller’s belly.\n\n“The jig’s up,” he said grimly. “You bumped Margie. Where’s the dough?”\n\nGreer turned a pasty yellow. “Are you crazy?”\n\n“Like a fox,” Corcoran snapped. “Listen. Shelton told the truth tonight when he said you only lost five hundred to him. When he told Margie you never intended to marry her. You were a smart skunk, Greer. You’d never swiped any dough from your bank. That was just a stall to make Margie fall in with your schemes.\n\n“You planned to rob Spot Shelton. He looked like an easy touch. And you did a lot of groundwork before you pulled the strings.\n\n“You first tried to work through Jackie Allan; but when she wouldn’t work with you, you ditched her. You took up with Margie. Margie fell for your line. She really figured you loved her, wanted to marry her. And she believed you when you said Shelton had gypped you out of thirty grand. That was a lie. And besides, Shelton’s dice are straight … .\n\n“Well, after Margie agreed to help you, you hired me. We pulled the heist; got the dough from Shelton’s safe. Shelton made threats. You saw a chance to get the money, be rid of Margie — and pin her murder on Shelton.”\n\nGreer gulped noisily. “You’re all wrong — ”\n\n“Nuts. You swiped Shelton’s diamond ring off his finger while he was tied to his chair, knocked out. Then you went ahead to Margie’s apartment house. You waited behind that drape.\n\n“You wore Shelton’s ring when you shot Margie. All I saw was your gun-hand — and the ring.\n\n“You didn’t drill me. You wanted me alive — so that I could testify it was Shelton’s hand I saw holding the murder-gun. You just conked me.\n\n“When I came to and rushed here to your place, you fired a shot out your window, so I’d hear it. Then you fell on the floor and played possum. You wanted me to think Shelton had come here and drilled you.\n\n“But the wound in your shoulder was from my bullet, Greer! I winged you when I shot through that drape after you drilled Margie!”\n\n“No, Corcoran! You’re crazy!”\n\n“Nuts! I should have guessed it right away, when I looked at your shoulder the first time. The blood had already started to clot. But I was dumb. I was dumb up to the time Spot Shelton slugged me on the jaw in Jackie Allan’s bungalow a little while ago. Then I saw the truth.”\n\n“Wh-what do you mean?”\n\n“Shelton poked me with his right — but it didn’t cut my cheek. He wasn’t wearing his ring!\n\n“That was the tip-off. Maybe somebody else had the ring. Not Jackie Allan, because her hands were smaller than the one I saw through that drape. And why didn’t Shelton croak me in Jackie’s bungalow when he had the chance? If he’d been guilty, he’d have drilled me to keep me from spilling. Instead, all he did was biff me. He just wanted a chance to get Jackie away — because he thought she was the killer. He loves her; wanted to protect her.\n\n“Okay. Jackie wasn’t guilty. But if Shelton thought she was, it meant he was innocent himself. Get it? So that cleared everybody but you, Greer.\n\n“You had motive: greed. You had opportunity. And you had my bullet hole through your shoulder. You also had a roscoe — which I just tricked away from you. Got anything to say now?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nTurn ’Em Loose\n\nGreer snarled: “You’ll never take me, Corcoran!” and swatted at the revolver in the private dick’s fist. Corcoran shot him through the other shoulder.\n\n“So you’ll suffer a little before they burn you,” he said. He was thinking of poor little Margie Zaine lying dead because she had loved unwisely … .\n\nA search disclosed the thirty thousand dollars that Greer had taken from Margie’s handbag. And Corcoran also found Shelton’s diamond ring, under Greer’s mattress. Corcoran phoned police headquarters.\n\n“Come and get the guy that bumped Margie Zaine,” he said.\n\n“We’ve already got him. Spot Shelton. Picked him up with a blonde a while ago.”\n\nCorcoran said: “Turn ’em loose. They’re clean. And you might tell Shelton that a dumb cluck named Corcoran would like an invite to the wedding … .”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

He was not yet used to the silent dignity of the hospital atmosphere.\n\nInside he took off his soft hat, crushed it in his hand, and instinctively softened his footfalls as he stepped to the information desk.\n\n“Mrs.—el—Follis?”\n\nThe girl silently plugged in the switchboard. A question, an answer:\n\n“Corridor B, room 8. They are waiting for you,” she said.\n\nSoftly, almost on tiptoe, he walked down the long corridor, passing a nurse in the light blue, white trimmed, uniform distinctive of the hospital, turned to the right, and lightly tapped at a door on which the figure “8” appeared.\n\nA nurse opened the door, looked at him, turned and beckoned to someone in the room.\n\nA physician, young, alert, came to the door, glanced at him a moment, came out and closed the door behind him.\n\nThe man before him nervously moistened his lips.\n\nThe physician looked at him keenly. The man’s eyes returned the look questioningly.\n\n“The time’s almost here,” said the physician. “It’s serious—the mother, or the baby. I’ve told her. She says to speak to you.”\n\nA lightning expression passed over the man’s face. The physician’s boring gaze noted, but did not fathom it.\n\n“May I see her?”\n\n“Yes—but only for a minute.” The physician turned and opened the door. The man advanced haltingly in the semi-darkness to the bedside.\n\n“John!” and two weak arms reached up and clasped him around the neck.\n\n“The doctor says—” her voice choked “the doctor says,” she whispered in weak tones in his ear, “that it is baby— or me.”\n\nA flash of pain winced her face, and she paused as it took her breath.\n\nIn a moment:\n\n“I told him I’d leave it to you,” she whispered as it passed.\n\n“My brave girl! My brave girl! I want you—of course I want you,” he answered, low voiced, but vibrant.\n\nA look of ineffable joy came over her face.\n\n“He wants me!” she said feebly, bright-eyed, joy-flushed, to the physician standing at the bedside. “He’s come back at last—and he wants me!”\n\nA spasm of pain convulsed her.\n\nThe physician leaned over quickly, and turned to the table of instruments at his side.pThe nurse gently took the man’s arm and led him to the door. Even in her pain the woman’s eyes lovingly followed him.\n\nThe door closed. A moment passed. It opened again, and the man’s head appeared inside.\n\n“Doctor!” he whispered softly.\n\nThe physician turned, looked, walked to the door. The man beckoned silently, and the physician went outside, closing the door quietly behind him.\n\n“Well?” he questioned.\n\n“Save the baby,” the man replied.\n\nThe physician stared at him … turned and re-entered the room.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Last year I’d met Jane in Hollywood and we’d made the joints\ntogether. She was a swell sport and we struck up a nice friendship. When\nI put her on the Sunset Limited for the east coast, she said, “If you’re\never in New York, look up my old man. He’ll know where I am. And if you\nwant a location for one of your sultry pictures of South Sea wenches,\nuse the family estate back of Miami.”\n\nLon’s picture was about a marine flyer that landed on a Pacific isle\nafter his plane conked out. I went to New York and saw Mr. Morgan. He\nsaid it was O. K. to use the place, so here I was in Florida.\n\nThe location was made to order. Palm trees, Spanish moss, palmettos,\nlush swamp grass and a tropical lake— everything the boss had ordered.\n\nHowever, instead of finding a deserted house and grounds, inhabited only\nby a lone caretaker, I found a lot of activity. Interesting activity,\nI’ll admit. Unknown to her old man, who thought she was in Aiken for the\nhorse shows, Jane had taken a breezer with three friends and a chaperone\nto the Florida estate and set up housekeeping in the mansion for a long\nweekend. An ideal spot, located in a remote section off the Tamiami\nTrail near the Everglades.\n\nThe three friends were Bill Drake, a handsome fellow, just out of Leyte\nand the army, with a Jap bullet in his leg; Betty Williams, his fiancée,\na blonde with a figure and looks that would stop traffic at Hollywood\nand Vine, and a guy named Harrison, whom I did not get to see. Harrison\nhad dived into the lake the first day they got there and cracked his\nhead on the bottom. He had gone back to Miami to get it fixed.\n\nThe chaperone was a sweet old lady named Mrs. Smythe. She had a\nmiddle-age spread and grey hair frizzled into ringlets about her head,\nand she would go around punching pillows to make people comfortable when\nshe wasn’t in the kitchen cooking.\n\nThe first day was perfect. I subbed for Harrison with the cracked head.\nWe danced and had a few drinks and looked at the moon and took a canoe\nride on the lake.\n\nThat night, what with the lake breezes, I popped off to sleep like a\nbaby. My room was on the second story, and it faced the lake. A long\nbalcony ran the length of the house. A cool breeze blew across the lawn\nand filtered through the big windows at the foot of my bed. It was\nthrough those windows that the gibbering came.\n\nI thought for a moment I was dreaming. I lay still, with my eyes fixed\non the big patch of pinkish blue that was the changing of moonlight into\ndawn.\n\nIt came again. A low, throaty, insane noise that grew in volume.\n\nI slipped from the bed and flattened against the wall as a shadow swayed\nacross the fluttering curtains. The shadow suddenly came into silhouette\nand developed into something out of a horror picture. It seemed tall,\nincredibly tall, though it stooped grotesquely, and its body was covered\nwith coarse hair. But the head was what started me talking to myself. It\nwas flat and long, covered with scales, and swung from side to side as\nthough set on a pivot. The snout protruded and the jaws opened and\nclosed with rhythmic regularity. An odor of rotting flesh swept in\nthrough the windows.\n\nAs it came into complete view I dived for my suitcase, where I had a\n.32. The thing was carrying a woman in its arms.\n\nAs I got to the window, I heard a thud. It had dropped from the balcony\nwith its burden, and I could see it scurrying, crab-like, across the\nlawn. I didn’t dare aim at it from that distance for fear of hitting the\ngirl, but I blazed away over its head and saw it drop her and streak for\nthe heavily wooded banks of the lake which bordered the far end of the\nsloping terrace.\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nRefugee From Frankenstein\n\nI whipped into a bathrobe, pounded down the stairs and out across the\nlawn. Then I stopped dead a moment. A figure, glistening in the\nmoonlight, had risen from the beach of the lake and was running towards\nme. I dodged behind a bush and waited until the figure was opposite,\nthen I dived for its legs. It was Bill Drake. He grunted and started to\nfight, then recognized me.\n\n“What’s all the shooting?” he demanded.\n\n“You swimming this time of morning—before daybreak?” I asked.\n\nHe nodded. “Yeah. I couldn’t sleep. I was on the beach and thought I\nheard shots.”\n\nI said “Some refugee from Frankenstein dragged a girl by my window. I\ntook a pot shot at it, and it dropped her near the lake.” I had pulled\nhim back towards the pond. “There she is now,” I added as a form on the\ngrass became visible in the moonlight.\n\nDrake struck a match. “God! It’s Betty!” he said.\n\nOn the grass, her clothes half torn from her body, Betty Williams lay\nwhimpering. I dropped down beside her and laid my hand against her\nthroat. A fast pulse pounded. “She’s O.K. Just out from fright.”\n\nDrake lifted her and she moaned. “Everything’s all right,” he said.\n“This is Bill.”\n\n“Take her back to the house and give her a shot of brandy,” I said. “I’m\ngoing to look around for that small edition of King Kong.”\n\nI slipped fresh cartridges into the .32 and pushed into the heavy\nunderbrush where I had seen the monster disappear. A few broken bushes\nshowed where it had fled; but the trail was soon lost in the darkness. I\nwent on toward the lake, but, after half an hour of wandering, the\nground became so marshy that it was almost impossible to go further.\n\nI turned back, cut sharply to the right, and came to the cottage of\nMiddings, the caretaker. When I knocked, there was no response. However\na light showed through a shaded window and I tried the door. It was\nunlocked. As I entered I sucked in my breath.\n\nOn the floor, with lips tightly curled in a hideous grin of death, lay\nan old woman. Her eyes, almost protruding from her head, seemed to be\nfixed straight on my face. I half expected to hear a scream of insane\nlaughter come tearing out of that horribly grinning mouth. Something had\ntorn away her throat. Blood still welled softly from the ghastly wound\ninto an ever-widening circle on the worn carpet.\n\nI glanced around the ill-lighted room and yanked at the .32 when I\nspotted a figure crouched in a corner. Then I relaxed. It was a girl of\nabout eighteen. A rough gingham dress, faded and torn, clung to her\nbody. She was barefoot, and her face—beautiful in a savage way —spoke of\nstark terror. I walked towards her.\n\n“What are you doing here?” I asked.\n\n“Me and Maw come over to see Jake?” the girl stammered.\n\n“At five o’clock in the morning?”\n\n“No, sir. We come over last night. We live a ways down the creek. When\nwe started home, Maw got skeered and we come back. Jake let us sleep\nhere and said he’d take the tool house out back.”\n\nI nodded towards the corpse on the floor. “Was she your mother?”\n\nThe girl kept her eyes on mine. “Yes, sir. Likewise, that is, she ain’t\nmy real maw, but I been livin’ with her since I can remember.”\n\nI studied the girl. A product of the swampland, beautiful, half-savage,\nwith a mass of black hair framing her oval, olive face, she was\nshivering like a high-strung, sleeping dog.\n\n“Where’s Jake Middings now?” I asked.\n\nShe lifted well-rounded shoulders. “I reckon he went up to the big\nhouse. I woke up when somebody was shooting. I thought it was Miss\nMorgan’s friends hunting ’possums. I must of gone off to sleep again.\nNext thing I knowed, there was that lamp lit and something awful was\na-hanging over Maw. It had a ’gator head. I got so skeered I musta\nfainted, because the next thing I knowed you was here and Maw was on the\nfloor—”\n\nShe started shaking as though on the verge of hysterics. I pulled her to\nher feet. “Come on, we’re going to the house. I’ll call the sheriff and\nget a posse here. What was your mother’s name?”\n\nThe girl huddled close to me as we went through the doorway. “Folks just\ncalled her Maw Tober. I’m Lissa.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nSomething Prowling The Swamps\n\nAt the house, Betty Williams was lying on a couch. Bill Drake sat beside\nher, an empty glass in his hand. Mrs. Smythe stood by with a bottle of\nsmelling salts. The brandy and salts had partly restored the girl’s\nnerves.\n\nJane Morgan ran to me as I entered. She had a touch of her old man’s\nsquare, stubborn jaw, but her face would have made a movie scout turn\nhandsprings. “Betty told me what happened,” she said. “Did you find\nanything?”\n\nMiddings, the caretaker, came in and interrupted my reply.\n\n“Miss Jane,” he said. “The phone’s dead. I can’t get the operator.” He\nturned to me. “Mister, did you really see it?”\n\nMiddings was a typical son of the soil. A large man, stooped from a\nlifetime of hard work, and a face lined from squinting in the Florida\nsun. He rubbed his hands together and I could hear a whispering rasp\nfrom his calloused palm. His voice was a soft-spoken Southern drawl.\n\nI nodded to his question. “Yes. I saw it.”\n\nThe caretaker backed away and I saw fear in his eyes. “Oh, Lawd!” he\nmoaned. “I never believed it till now.”\n\n“Believed what?” I asked sharply.\n\n“Ever since the last big wind,” he said, “folks been talking about\nsomething prowling the swamps nights. Dogs been bit and tore on dry land\nwhere no ’gator ever was, yet the way they was chewed up was just like a\n’gator does. Maw Tober heard something last night when she left my\nplace. She and Lissa was so scared they come back and spent the night at\nmy shack.”\n\nI thought of the pitiful body lying on the caretaker’s cabin floor. “I’m\ndriving to Ferndale to get the sheriff,” I told them. I headed for my\nroom where I changed my pajamas for a rough jacket and slacks.\n\nIt was light as I entered the barn which served as a garage. Inside were\nthree cars—my coupe, Jane’s Mercedes roadster and a station wagon.\n\nI swung into the coupe and pushed the starter. The motor whirred but\nnothing happened. I tried again and still no response. I got out, lifted\nthe hood, and found every spark plug smashed off at the base.\n\nI checked the Mercedes next, then the station wagon. Each had been\nsabotaged. Things were shaping.\n\nI had a tingling down my spine as I turned to go out of the barn. At the\ndoor I ran head-on into a man. He grunted and dropped his pipe. I backed\noff, fingering my gun.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nRiding to Ferndale\n\nHe was a seedy-looking character.\n\nPig-eyes that were bloodshot, a worn coat of loud plaids, and a denim\nshirt opened at the throat. He reached down and picked up his pipe.\n“Morning. Just taking an early stroll through old man Morgan’s grounds,”\nhe said.\n\nI looked down at his shoes—and saw one pants-cuff covered with blood.\n\nThe stranger followed my gaze. “Horse of mine got a wire cut,” he\nexplained. “I was fixing his leg this morning.”\n\n“You live nearby?” I asked.\n\nHe nodded. “Yep. Next estate. Name’s Sterling. John Sterling. Maw Tober,\nwho does my cleaning, said some folks were here. I was coming over later\nand pay my respects.”\n\n“Come on up to the house,” I said. “My name’s Ferguson.” We walked a\nhundred yards in silence. The name Sterling rang a bell. I had seen the\nnames Sterling and Morgan on the financial sheets of the Los Angeles\npapers. The two were big competitors in Wall Street.\n\nSterling whipped at the grass with a crop he carried, then chuckled.\n“You been here long enough to see the phantom ’gator?”\n\nI looked at him sharply, saw him grinning, but he avoided my gaze, still\nwhipping at the grass.\n\n“Yes,” I said. “It tried to kidnap one of Miss Morgan s guests—”\n\nSterling’s grin vanished. He stood still and gaped at me. “You kidding?”\nhe shrilled.\n\nI told him no, and explained what had happened that morning. We walked\non towards the house. He kept shaking his head. “You know, there’s been\ntales going around the natives about an alligator that waits on its hind\nlegs, and has eyes that flash fire and that sort of rot—You sure you saw\nthis thing?” He was staring at me now.\n\nWe had reached the steps of the house. “Yes,” I said, “and I’m going to\nnotify the sheriff. Do you have a car I can borrow? The ones in the barn\nhave been put out of commission.”\n\nSterling shook his head. “No. Mine’s in Miami getting new rings. But I\ncan give you a horse. You could make Ferndale in a couple of hours.”\n\nSuddenly what I had said dawned on him. “Good God Almighty! What do you\nmean, ‘put out of comm—’ ”\n\nJane Morgan came out of the front door and interrupted his shout. I\nintroduced her neighbor and he smiled with crooked, tobacco-stained\nteeth. I could see she didn’t like him as she turned to me. I pulled her\naside.\n\n“Listen,” I said. “Someone smashed the plugs in the three cars. This\nfellow Sterling has offered us a horse, so, if it’s all right with you,\nI’ll send Middings to Ferndale to get the sheriff. Things are getting\ntoo thick for me to leave.”\n\nShe nodded silently and I could see she was frightened. I patted her\nshoulder. “I’d better get Middings started. I want to pick up this\nalligator’s trail now that it’s light.”\n\nI called Middings, and he left with Sterling for the latter’s place to\nride for the sheriff. I crossed the wide lawn and splashed into the\nmarshy ground that bordered the lake.\n\nDank underbrush slashed my legs and, as I went further into the swamp,\nthe thick growth covered my head. Brush slapped at my face and tore my\nhands. For a moment I had an eerie feeling that those twigs and branches\nswayed as though alive. Palm trees rattled their fronds with a noise\nlike that of giant lizards slithering over a wall.\n\nA raindrop hit my forehead. Glancing up, I saw that clouds were\ngathering fast and obscuring the sun. I hurried towards the woods at the\nfar end of the lake, reaching them just as the storm broke.\n\nThe rain came down in crashing sheets as I halted by a huge fallen palm\nat the edge of the lake. It had left a small cave where its roots had\nbeen, and into this I crept. The waters of the lake lapped into the\nfront of the hole, but further back it was drier, I crouched there,\nwatching the storm for almost an hour. In spite of my uncomfortable\nposition, the steady pounding of the rain made me drowsy. My eyes had\nbecome fixed on a little pool of water in the cave. The rain made the\nsurface shimmer like silver.\n\nAs suddenly as it came, the tropical storm stopped. The water of the\nlake shivered and became placid. The little pool I had been watching\nbecame mirror-clear. As I crawled from under the bank, a bright object\non the bottom of the pool caught my eye. I rolled up my sleeve, thrust\nmy arm down, and picked up a coin. Kneeling in the water, I examined it\nand found it to be an old Spanish gold doubloon.\n\nAnd then it came again—that insane gibbering, starting low and\nincreasing in volume until it reached a screaming crescendo, hammering\nupon my ears. Mirrored in the pool was the image of the monster, poised\nover me, its mouth opening and closing.\n\nI tried to roll and pull my gun, but the monster crashed down, and\nthrust me into the pool. My head smashed against a stone and the lake\nand palm trees seemed to spin. There was a smell of rotting flesh as\nclaw-like hands closed around my throat. Then the water closed over me\nand I was out.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nMaw Tober’s Cabin\n\nI woke up slowly to a throbbing headache. I heard a slight rustling\nnoise and opened my eyes.\n\n“Feelin’ better?” a soft voice drawled.\n\nI looked up. Standing over me was the swamp girl, Lissa. The room was\ndimly lit and furnished with rustic pieces of homemade furniture. I was\non a bed and over me were piles of blankets. I tried to sit up.\n\nThe girl leaned over and put her hand on my shoulder. “Just be quiet.\nYou’re in Maw’s and my cabin. Here.” She handed me a steaming glass of\nwhiskey toddy.\n\nI drank obediently, studying the girl. She had changed from the gingham\ndress she had worn when I first saw her into a pair of jeans and a man’s\nshirt.\n\nI finished the drink and fumbled the glass to the floor. “How’d I get\nhere, Lissa?” I asked.\n\n“I fetched you,” she answered with a quick smile. “Found you laying in\nthe path just outside this cabin, with a knot on your head and you\nsoaking wet.” The drink burned pleasantly in my stomach and the\nthrobbing of my head subsided. My mind skipped back to the lake, the\nrain, and gold coin and the gibbering thing that smelled of putrefied\nflesh. I sniffed and wondered if the odor there in the cabin was a trick\nof imagination. No, it was there—a faint, elusive smell of the dead.\n\nI shoved the blankets aside and swung my feet to the floor. The girl had\nsaid I was lying on the path outside the cabin. I went to a window and\npushed back the flour-sack curtains. Rank undergrowth pushed against the\nside of the house.\n\nI turned to Lissa. “How far is it from the lake?”\n\n“’Bout half a mile. Judging by the bump on your head, I figger you\nwandered around and happened to end up here. The path leads from the\nlake.” She turned towards the kitchen. “I got your jacket drying by the\nstove. I’ll get it.”\n\nAs Lissa disappeared through the door, I wondered how she knew I had\ncome from the lake. Funny she didn’t ask about the crack on my head. She\nwas supposed to be at the Morgan house. Obviously, she had come back to\nher cabin through the rainstorm, because she had changed clothes. I\nsniffed again. That damned smell of rotting flesh—\n\nI glanced about the room. Dimly outlined on a packing case, at the far\nside, ticked a battered alarm clock. I walked towards it. Four o’clock.\nIt had been morning when the monster attacked me. I had been unconscious\nseveral hours, if that clock was right. I felt dizzy again, and rubbed\nmy hand over my face and massaged my eyes. As the blur disappeared, my\neyes focused on the packing case. Stencilled on its sides was “MARINE\nEQUIP. SALVAGE CO., KEY WEST.” I wondered if it had contained parts for\na motorboat, then remembered that the lake boasted of nothing more than\na couple of rowboats and three canoes.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA Bit of Swimming Before Dark\n\nThe entrance of Lissa interrupted my thoughts. Over one arm she carried\nmy jacket, and in her hand was another steaming glass. As she brushed\nthrough the kitchen door I noticed even more strongly that stench of\ndeath.\n\nFrom outside came a crackle of the underbrush. The girl’s eyes widened\nand her gaze shot towards the window. The drink she held slopped over\nand burned her hand; the glass crashed to the floor. She turned madly\nand dived into the kitchen, slamming the door. I heard a bolt shot into\nplace.\n\nI went to the window and listened. Something was coming. The brush\nsnapped and swished but the thick growth along the path hid whatever it\nwas from view. I picked up my jacket from where Lissa had dropped it and\nran my hand into its pockets for the gun. It was gone.\n\nA heavy iron poker leaned against the clay fireplace. I hefted it,\nflattened against the wall by the door, and waited. There was a footstep\non the porch and the doorknob turned slowly. I raised the poker.\n\n“Lissa!”\n\nIt was Jane Morgan’s voice.\n\nI pulled the door wide. The girl’s strained face turned to one of\nrelief. “Tom. Thank God. I was afraid you were dead.”\n\nI rubbed the welt on my forehead but said nothing.\n\nJane’s gaze swept the cabin. “Is Lissa here? She left the house shortly\nafter you did. I thought she had gone to be with her mother at the\ncabin.”\n\nLissa came quietly into the room and leaned against the kitchen door.\nHate smouldered in her eyes as she glared at Jane. “If you city folks\nhadn’t come down here, maybe—” She stopped. Fear again crept into her\nface.\n\n“Maybe what?” I asked.\n\nShe became sullen. “Nothing,” she murmured.\n\nI turned back to Jane. “Did Middings get back with the sheriff?”\n\nShe shook her head. “No. That’s why I’m so worried. Neither he nor\nSterling returned. I’m afraid the storm caught them. There’s a creek to\nford on the Ferndale road, and it might have flooded.”\n\nI whipped into my jacket. Things were clearing. I grabbed Jane’s arm.\n“Come on. We’re going back to the house. This alligator scare is still\non the loose and there’s no telling where it’ll strike next. Besides,\nI’ve got a bit of swimming to do before dark.”\n\nJane looked at me to see if she had heard right. “Swimming?”\n\nI nodded. I would explain later. “Have you a gun at the house?” I asked\nher as we pushed through the undergrowth.\n\n“Yes, Bill Drake has one. We used it to shoot at tin cans the first day\nwe got here.”\n\nThe three of us reached the house just as it was getting dusk. I went to\nmy room, changed into swimming trunks and came downstairs. Drake handed\nme his gun and started to ask questions, but I brushed him aside. It was\ngetting dark. I needed daylight and every minute counted.\n\nI started at a trot across the acre wide lawn, then slowed to a cautious\nwalk as I pushed into the tropical growth and headed for the deep end of\nthe lake. It was a twenty-minute walk and it skirted the caretaker’s\ncottage. The house was in shadows and the clapboards weather-worn—a\ncrypt for the murdered body of Maw Tober.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nThe Phantom ‘Gator\n\nAt last I reached the lower end of the lake and stood beside the fallen\npalm where I had met the monster a few short hours before. I glanced\naround for any sign of life, but only an eerie silence prevailed. The\nsudden “pung” of a bullfrog convinced me I was alone.\n\nThe sun was sinking fast but the water was still clear. I could see the\nsandy bottom. I took a deep breath and dived straight down.\n\nThe depth was deceptive. I went deeper and deeper and my lungs started\naching. The lump on my head began its crazy tattoo into my brain but I\nfought my way to the bottom. At last I felt sand against my fingers, and\nscooped frantically with both hands. Hugging the sand close to my chest,\nI kicked my way to the surface, where I gasped for air. Then I looked at\nmy sand. There were three gold coins in it, similar to the one I had\nfound during the storm. The bottom of the lake at that point was covered\nwith the scattered gold of some ancient treasure.\n\nA faint breeze stirred across the lake and brought to my nostrils the\nsmell of death. Dead leaves rustled in the path above me on the edge of\nthe lake. A gibbering rose and fell. I ducked under water and stroked\nsilently to an overhanging bank. Directly over the cave where I had laid\na towel, weighted down with the gun, was the alligator-monster. Its head\npivoted wildly, its jaws opening and closing.\n\nI ducked under water again and kicked my way fifty feet from the cave.\nSlipping out onto the path, now almost hidden in the darkness, I crept\non hands and knees towards the yammering thing.\n\nSuddenly there was a wild scream from a woman’s throat. I jerked up and\ndived for the cave. By the water’s edge, struggling in the grasp of the\nmonster, was Lissa. She was fighting against the claw-like hands that\ngripped her throat.\n\nAs I went into a flying tackle it saw me and dropped the girl. I landed\na belly-flopper on the towel and gun, and managed to roll upright. I\nheld the .32 aimed at the belly. “Hold it,” I said, “or you’ll get\nblasted.”\n\nOnly an insane scream came from the creature as it sprang. I slammed\nfour slugs into its belly in mid-air. It became limp as it fell, and a\nhuman, gurgling cough belched from it. The grotesque mask that formed\nthe head lolled wildly a moment, then was still. I jerked it off,\nrevealing Middings. The caretaker’s fast-glazing eyes glared at me in\nimpotent hate as a bubble of blood showed at the corner of his mouth. He\ngagged, and another belch brought a gush of blood. The stench of death\nwas sickening.\n\nI turned to the girl, who was making feeble efforts to get up. I raised\nher gently. “Are you hurt?” I asked.\n\n“No,” she said, and fainted.\n\nJane and Bill Drake met us half way back. They had heard the shots and\nstarted out to find me. At the house we forced brandy down Lissa’s\nthroat and she came to. She stared around wildly.\n\n“Is Jake dead?” she whispered.\n\nI nodded.\n\n“Thank God!” she said.\n\n“You mean you knew Middings was the monster?” I asked.\n\n“Yes,” said Lissa. “You see, Jake found a lot of gold. It was a Spanish\ntreasure that folks hunted for years ’round here. It’d been buried under\na palm tree which was blowed down during the last big wind. When the\ntree fell, it flung most of the gold in the deep end of the lake. Jake\ntold me about it, but said he’d kill me if I told anybody. He bought a\ndiving suit, but the day he got it Miss Morgan and her friends come.\n\n“Jake went crazy over the gold. Swore you all had come down to take it\naway from him. He rigged up an old ’gator head to fit the diving suit\nand covered the suit with ’coon skins; said he was going to scare you\naway or kill you all.”\n\nI interrupted. “Lissa, have you any raccoon skins at your cottage?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nLissa’s Story\n\nShe nodded. “Yes. Nailed up outside the kitchen.”\n\n“O. K.,” I said. “Go on with your story.” Now I knew where the stench\ncame from. Skins drying in the Florida sun don’t smell like attar of\nroses.\n\n“I was afeared Jake was going to kill me after he got the gold,” said\nLissa. “Yesterday he tried to get Miss Williams.”\n\nBetty Williams shuddered and pressed close to Drake.\n\n“I was afeared you all would get scared and leave,” continued Lissa, “So\nI busted the spark plugs.” She looked up guiltily at me and I grinned\nback at her.\n\n“Last night Maw and me was over to Jake’s and he told Maw about the\ngold. She said he should write Mr. Morgan.”\n\nThat forged the last link. “So that’s why he killed her,” I said.\n\n“Yes,” said Lissa. “Jake got mad and we left for home, but he must of\nrun ahead and hid. He scared Maw and me so that we run back to the\ncottage. He come in a few minutes later; acted like he wasn’t mad and\nsaid we could stay over night. This morning he sneaked in, dressed in\nhis ’gator suit, and killed Maw. I was afeared to tell on account of\nwhat Jake might do to me.\n\n“When you started out this morning, I knew Jake was going to follow. Him\ngoing for the sheriff let him out easy. I made like I wanted to be with\nMaw. I followed Jake and caught him just as he was choking you. I talked\nhim into not killing you; said it would bring the law down here and he’d\nnever get his gold, so we carried you to my cabin.\n\n“Tonight, when you said you was going swimming, I knew you had got onto\nthe treasure and I knew if Jake caught you he’d kill you for sure, so\nwhen you left I sneaked out soon as I could. I got to the lake after\nJake did. He saw me coming. He wouldn’t listen to me. Said I’d told on\nhim and about his treasure. Then you come along and shot Jake.”\n\nThe sheriff came in then, followed by John Sterling, whose head was\nbandaged. He explained that Middings had attacked him at his house and\nleft him for dead. He’d come to several hours later and gone after the\nsheriff.\n\nI told the sheriff the whole story. He rubbed his chin. “But how did you\ndiscover the gold?” he asked.\n\nI explained. “When I found a gold Spanish coin in a hole I had crawled\ninto out of the rain, I thought of the Spanish treasure story I’d heard\nin Miami. Later, at Lissa’s cabin, I saw a newly opened box from a\nmarine company. The box suggested a diving suit, so I put two and two\ntogether and figured there must be more coins on the bottom of the lake,\nand that somebody knew about them.\n\n“When I found out from Jane that Middings hadn’t returned, I decided he\nmust be the one who knew about it.\n\n“I went to the lake, dived down, and found the treasure scattered on the\nsandy bottom. Jake showed up in his alligator rig and attacked Lissa. I\nhad to shoot him. That’s about all.”\n\nThe sheriff nodded. “Yep. I reckon that’s about all. Except for goin’\nand gettin’ Jake’s body. Mind taking me to the spot?”\n\nOnce more I cut through the lush swamp undergrowth, but this time with\nthe sheriff with me and no fear of things lurking in the dusk.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

He snorted as he\nopened the door of the police car and stepped into the drizzle of rain.\nThe cobblestones of Shadwell Dock were slippery, and nearby the muddy\nriver splashed against the wharf as some big liner nosed downstream.\n\n“I don’t know why the Excise people called you in, Hawke,” Baxter said\ngruffly. “It’s a job we can handle.”\n\n“Sorry!” The famous criminologist smiled as he followed the Yard officer\nfrom the car. “I told them the same thing,” he said, “but they insisted\nI should look into this murder.”\n\n“It’s a routine job,” Baxter went on. “I believe you know the bare\nfacts? Inspector Thomas Ware of the Customs Service was stabbed to death\nat the entrance to this dock. There was a thick fog and nobody saw the\nkiller. The only clue is that Ware was on the watch for dope-smugglers,\nand had information that stuff might be brought in on this ship.”\n\nAs he spoke, the inspector pointed to a rusty tramp-steamer moored to\nthe wharf. She was the S.S. Rover, a three-thousand-ton craft which had\narrived from India two weeks previously. The ship was unloaded and was\ndue to sail again, but she had been held up for inquiries.\n\n“Ware was on the watch from the time she arrived?” Hawke asked.\n\n“Day and night. He was positive the dope-runner would try to bring the\nstuff ashore just before sailing. I have men on board making a thorough\nsearch. In the meantime, the crew are confined to the ship, and they’re\nnot pleased about it.”\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Dope Discovery\n\nGroups of sullen men were standing about the deck when the investigators\nwent aboard. Captain Brent, the commander of the vessel, was outspoken\nregarding his displeasure at being kept in dock.\n\n“How much longer are you keeping us here?” he demanded. “I’m two days\nlate already, and this ship runs on a time schedule. I’m not going to be\ntied up by a big-footed copper for the rest of my life!”\n\nBaxter flushed and struggled to keep his temper in check. He introduced\nHawke, and the skipper stretched out a hairy paw.\n\n“I’ve heard of you,” he said. “Perhaps you’ll solve the thing quickly,\nand let me get on my way.”\n\nThe captain rammed his hat on his head, and led the way down a steep\niron ladder into the bowels of the ship. A number of men were busy in\nthe bunkers shifting tons of coal. The search had been completed\nelsewhere, and the bunkers were the last hope. If nothing was found\nthere, the ship would be released immediately.\n\n“You have the same crew for this trip?” Hawke asked.\n\n“The same,” Captain Brent said. “They all signed on with the exception\nof two men who are in hospital. I brought ’em in sick, and they went off\nin an ambulance. You can’t suspect them.”\n\n“Do you know your crew well?”\n\n“As much as you can ever know sailormen. They’re tough, if that’s what\nyou mean.”\n\nHe was interrupted by a shout from one of the police officers who was\nsearching a nearby bunker. The captain, Dixon Hawke and Baxter climbed\nover the coal. The officer had uncovered a metal bin hidden by a thin\nlayer of coal. It contained two dozen tins bearing the name of a\nwell-known brand of tobacco.\n\nBaxter quickly opened a tin, and his eyes gleamed when he found it was\nfilled with a white powder. He tasted the stuff, and made a wry face as\nhe spat.\n\n“Dope,” he said. “Poor Ware was right when he suspected this ship!” He\nturned to face Captain Brent, and his voice became harsh.\n\n“What do you know about this?” he asked.\n\n“What should I know about it, mister?” the skipper roared. “I don’t live\ndown in the bunkers. Anybody could have stored the stuff away without\nanother man in the ship being aware of it.”\n\n“If we find the man who hid this, we get Ware’s killer,” said Baxter.\n“He was probably taking the cans ashore a few at a time, and Ware caught\nhim with a load. We know the killing was done with a seaman’s bowie\nknife. The man we want is on your ship!”\n\n“Does this mean I can’t sail?” asked the skipper.\n\n“Correct,” Baxter said. “I’ll keep you tied up until the killer loses\nhis nerve and tries to desert!”\n\nCaptain Brent ripped out an oath. “We’ll see about that,” he said. “I’ll\ntelephone my owners and tell ’em to take legal action. I’ll sail in\ntwenty-four hours!”\n\nThe Yard officer frowned. He was aware that he could not keep the ship\nin dock indefinitely. Unless he had some strong clue, the courts would\norder the vessel to be released, particularly since the drugs had been\nfound.\n\n“I’ve got a suggestion to make,” Dixon Hawke said. He had been silent\nfor a long time, but his shrewd brain had been busy. “I may be able to\nhurry matters,” he went on. “Have you ever heard of Professor Zolty?”\n\n“Zolty?” Baxter frowned. “Isn’t he the crack-brained Pole who invented a\nmachine for reading people’s thoughts?”\n\n“That’s right,” Hawke said. “The Thought Machine, he calls it, but\nthanks to the newspapers it’s more popularly known as the Lie-Detector.\nI’m going to ask permission to use it on the crew!”\n\nChief Inspector Baxter gave vent to a laugh of derision.\n\n“I’ve heard of lie-detectors and truth drugs,” he said, “but they’re all\nas mad as perpetual-motion machines. What’s the matter with you, Hawke?\nYou know those things won’t work.”\n\n“I’ll take the risk. If the captain gives permission, I’ll use it\ntomorrow. Professor Zolty is in London, and I’ll borrow the apparatus.”\n\nThe skipper called the men together and told them of the suggestion.\nSome of the hands grinned and others looked uneasy, but a throaty chorus\ngave assent to the experiment.\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n“The Thing Works!”\n\nBaxter went off, but Hawke remained on the vessel for a private talk\nwith Captain Brent. When he finally left the dock, the skipper walked\nwith him to the gates. There was a curious twinkle in his blue eyes as\nhe wrung Hawke’s hand.\n\nFor the rest of the day Dixon Hawke was very busy making certain\narrangements. He telephoned Baxter that he would be ready to try out the\nmachine in the morning.\n\nIt was just after nine o’clock the following day when the\ncriminologist’s car stopped at the gates of the dock. Tommy Burke, his\nassistant, was at the wheel. Hawke lifted a heavy black case from the\ncar, and carried it carefully aboard the freighter.\n\nBaxter and some other police officials had already arrived, and they\ngrinned broadly as the Thought Machine was set up. It consisted of a\nsmall cabinet, very much like a radio receiver. There was a metal band\nto place round the head of the man to be tested. Another strap of metal\nwas to be fastened to the wrist.\n\nHawke clipped a pair of headphones over his ears, and pressed a switch.\nThere was a faint humming from the apparatus, and a large dial lit up.\n\n“I’m ready now,” the criminologist said quietly. “I wish Professor Zolty\nhad been able to come. Unfortunately he is confined to his room with a\nmild attack of fever.”\n\n“Brain fever?” Baxter asked. “Go ahead, Hawke. It’s your funeral!”\n\nTommy placed a chair within reach of the apparatus, and the members of\nthe Rover’s crew lined up on deck. The men stared curiously at the\nThought Machine.\n\nWhen Hawke beckoned, the first man in the line stepped forward. He was a\nperky Cockney, and winked at his mates as he sat in the chair. The\ncontacts were attached, and the apparatus switched on. A faint\nexpression of alarm crossed the sailor’s face.\n\n“Where were you on the night of the murder?” Hawke asked.\n\n“In me ’ammock, guv’nor. S’welp me, I was! I don’t know nuffin’. If that\nthing works, you can tell by me thoughts.”\n\n“I can. You’re more worried about what’s going to win the 2.30 than\nanything else. Next man, please!”\n\nThe Cockney blinked as he left the chair, and Tommy heard him telling\nhis mates that the 2.30 race had been in his mind. The young fellow also\nnoticed a sporting journal sticking out of the man’s pocket, and he\nwondered if his employer had made a shrewd guess because of it.\n\nThe next man was a hungry-looking fellow with shifty eyes. He was very\npale, and hesitated before he finally sat down. As Hawke adjusted the\ncontacts, the man mumbled protests.\n\n“I don’t know anything about this,” he said. “I wasn’t here, sir. I’ve\nonly just signed on.”\n\n“That’s true,” Captain Brent agreed. “I signed on two men to replace the\nsick members of my crew.”\n\nHawke motioned him to be silent. He had switched on the Thought Machine\nand was watching the dial, where a needle swung to and fro. Frowning, he\nfixed the sailor with a hard stare.\n\n“You’re afraid! ” he said curtly.\n\n“I—I—” The man twisted in his seat, and his hands trembled. He seemed to\nbe on the verge of getting up and running. “That’s a lie! ” he panted.\n“I’ve got nothing to be afraid of.”\n\n“Now, that’s a lie! What about the police?” Hawke asked.\n\nThe needle on the dial moved violently, and Baxter, who had been\nwatching it, gave a start of surprise. Hawke gave a grim smile.\n\n“You are afraid of the police,” he said. “”What’s your name? Why are you\nafraid?”\n\nThe sailor stuttered that his name was Caudwell, but after that his\nvoice trailed away, and he huddled back in the chair. Hawke moved a\nknob, and the buzzing from the apparatus became louder. He put his hands\nover the headphones, pressing them tightly against his ears. “You are\nthinking about the police,” he insisted. “I know you—”\n\nWith a wild cry Caudwell tore the contacts from his head and wrist, and\njumped to his feet.\n\n“Ail right! ” he panted. “It’s true, and I’m glad you found out! I did a\njob in Manchester last week. I hit an old woman who ran a shop, and\npinched the till! That’s why I came down here and signed up on this\nship. I was trying to get out of the country! You’ve got me—it’s a fair\ncop! ”\n\nA roar of excitement came from the crew, and a constable stepped forward\nand gripped the sailor’s arm. Baxter, with an exclamation of\nastonishment, stared from Hawke to the machine, and from the machine to\nthe petty criminal.\n\n“By Jove! ” he said. “The thing works! ”\n\n“It appears to,” the criminologist said. “I wasn’t looking for such a\nsuccess. You’d better hold this man for inquiries.”\n\nHe turned to face the crew. Those men who had been joking were now\nserious, and there was some hesitating when Hawke beckoned for another\nman to come forward.\n\nVery slowly a burly stoker came forward and sat down awkwardly in the\nchair. Beads of perspiration showed on his forehead as the apparatus was\nadjusted.\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Guilty Conscience\n\n“Take it easy,” said Dixon Hawke. “If you are innocent there is nothing\nfor you to fear.”\n\nHe let the man go after a brief examination, and another took his place.\nSlowly Hawke worked down the line of men.\n\nIt was a slow process, for each examination took about five minutes, and\nthere were thirty-six men in the crew. Those who were at the end of the\nline, and had a long time to wait, showed signs of nervousness.\n\n“Well, we’re not getting anywhere,” Baxter said gruffly after most of\nthe crew had been examined.\n\n“There are still five men left,” Hawke said. “I have great faith in the\nmachine. If the killer is on the ship, I shall find him.”\n\nHe gave the remaining five of the Rover’s crew a keen look. One of them\nwas the ship’s cook, a Chinese, and the others were two stokers, a\ndeckhand, and Captain Brent’s steward. The cook in particular looked\nalarmed, and when Hawke beckoned, a stoker gave the man a rough push.\n\n“Go on, Chinky! ” he growled. “I bet you’re the one he wants. I saw you\nnosing about in them bunkers after we left Singapore.”\n\n“Not true! ” said the cook. “Velly innocent man. Know nothing! ”\n\n“Come here! ” Hawke said, pointing to the stoker. “I’ll take you next.”\nThe man hesitated. He was a big fellow, and had watched the proceedings\nwith a leering smile on his lips. The grin was still there as he stepped\nto the chair. He cleared his throat and spat.\n\n“I didn’t agree to this,” he muttered. “A sailor has got his rights like\nany other bloke—”\n\n“Sit down,” snapped Hawke. Slowly the fellow obeyed, and Hawke fastened\nthe metal bands about his forehead and wrist.\n\n“What’s your name?” he asked.\n\n“Sam Toller. Listen here, mister, I don’t like this thing. Besides,\nwhoever heard of a machine that could read a bloke’s thoughts?”\n\n“It read correctly in one case,” Hawke said.\n\nAs he touched the switch and set the apparatus humming, the man in the\nchair became silent. The defiant smile faded, and Hawke saw his big\nhands begin to twitch.\n\nVery deliberately the criminologist turned a knob, increasing the power.\nThe humming went up to a higher pitch than ever, and the needle on the\ndial swung violently from side to side. Before Hawke could ask a\nquestion, a yell came from Sam Toller. Jumping to his feet he seized the\nThought Machine in both hands and, raising it over his head, sent it\nsmashing down on the deck.\n\nThe criminologist plunged forward, but ducked as Toller swung a vicious\nblow at his head. With an oath the man turned and ran along the deck.\n\n“Stop him! ” Dixon Hawke roared. “He’s the killer of Inspector Ware! ”\nThe two constables at the top of the gangway intercepted the man, and a\nfew minutes later he was taken below to await the arrival of the police\nvan.\n\n“Toller is your man all right,” Hawke assured Baxter, when the\nexcitement was over. “I haven’t a doubt he killed Inspector Ware. All\nthe same, you’ll need more evidence than that. I suggest you check up\nhis movements since coming ashore. A diver had better be sent down to\nsearch for his knife. You’ll get strong evidence by comparing it with\nthe stab wounds in Ware’s body.” Baxter nodded.\n\n“I’ll do that, Hawke. I realise a jury will not accept the evidence of\nthe Thought Machine. By Jove, but you certainly made me look silly! That\napparatus will revolutionise the detection of crime! ”\n\nA twinkle came into Dixon Hawke’s eyes, and his assistant smiled\nbroadly. There was also a loud guffaw from Captain Brent.\n\n“What’s the joke?” Baxter asked.\n\n“The machine. You were right about it, Baxter. It was tested and proved\nto be worthless. The apparatus I used was merely an old radio set that\nTommy fixed up for me last night.”\n\n“But what about Professor Zolty?”\n\n“As far as I know, he is still on the Continent.”\n\n“Confound it, Hawke! Then how did you catch that man Caudwell who\nconfessed to a crime in Manchester?” Dixon Hawke beckoned to the sailor\nwho had made such an astounding confession at the beginning of the\nexperiment. He came forward smiling and holding out his handcuffed\nwrists.\n\n“I’ll be glad to have these removed, Mr. Hawke. I hope you’ll excuse my\nsaying so, but that was the best piece of acting I’ve done to date.”\n\n“Acting?” bellowed Baxter.\n\n“Acting,” repeated Hawke. “Mr. Caudwell happens to be on the stage, and\nhas never committed a crime in his life. I got Captain Brent to sign him\non just for this experiment. You see, like you, I was convinced the\nkiller was one of the crew. I was certain he would hang back to the last\nwhen I made the fake test, so Mr. Caudwell kindly obliged with a\nconfession to make it appear the Thought Machine was a success. You know\nthe rest. Waiting broke Toller’s nerve. He really feared I would read\nhis thoughts, so he bolted in panic and gave himself away.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

He only lives over again in memory the days when he was Chief of Police of the Nevada mining-town.\n\nIn its prime, Yucca City boasted a population of ten thousand inhabitants, and Main Street was cluttered with gambling-parlors, saloons, dance halls. Then the mining-boom petered out, and the town was deserted. A Police Chief was no longer needed, but Jim refused to leave, believing the town would “come alive” in a new gold rush, and he would get his old job back.\n\nFor years now, Jim’s sole companions have been snakes, lizards, horned-toads, bats, and other crawling, hopping, flying denizens of the desert that make their habitat in the crumbling, dilapidated buildings on Main Street. These, and a flea-bitten old bear-dog and an aged burro keep Jim company.\n\nSometimes “Mexican Joe” Mendez, a grizzled, swarthy-skinned resident of the Nevada Desert, visits Jim, following him about like a faithful old dog. Jim saved Mexican Joe’s life once, when a drunken prospector had tried to cut Joe’s throat.\n\nOne afternoon, not long ago, Jim’s eyes bulged at sight of a large aggregation of people coming toward Ghost-Town over the shimmering sands. The shock brought him out of his chair, with a gasp, dropping his pipe.\n\n“By golly Moses! The old town’s cornin’ alive again in a new gold-rush!” he blurted.\n\nNerves jumping with excitement, he rushed forth to greet the newcomers, only to meet with bitter disappointment. The cavalcade of men, women, horses, trucks, trailers, had come into the Nevada desert to “shoot” scenes for a historical-Western motion-picture.\n\nAt first Jim refused to be welcoming host to the visitors, resenting their intrusion on his privacy. But after considerable persuasion, movie-director Dave Parsons prevailed on him to act as guide about Ghost-Town and play a “bit” role in the picture.\n\n“All right! Go ahead with your danged tomfoolery!” growled Jim. “An’ git it over quick! I ain’t hankerin’ for company!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nGhost-Town\n\nThat evening, when the movie actors gathered on the old Tonapha &amp;amp; Hassayampa depot platform, Jim Boggs told hair-raising yarns about boom-town days that gave his listeners the creeps. Mexican Joe Mendez had drifted in from the desert and joined the group.\n\n“The spirits of the dead—dance-hall gals, gamblers, outlaws, come flittin’ down Main Street ‘round the old buildings ‘most every even-in’,” concluded Jim somberly. “Along ‘bout midnight, they starts in wail-in’, moanin’ an’ lamentin’ over their past sins.”\n\nDexter Marlow, the movie villain, a handsome, swarthy, sinister-looking thespian, sat beside Mazie O’Hern, the company’s pretty, dark-eyed leading lady. “Ghosts—bosh!” he rasped sneeringly. “Damned tommyrot and nonsense! The only ghosts around here are in the brains of some foolish, superstitious humans!”\n\n“I’m—I’m not so sure of that!” said Mazie O’Hern, peering awesomely at the moonlit desolation of Main Street. “After hearing Mr. Boggs’ gruesome experiences as Police Chief of Yucca City, I—I feel sort of jittery and squeamish.”\n\n“Nonsense!” scoffed Marlow. “Living alone in this damnable desert has made Mr. Boggs neurotic! His ‘ghosts’ are nothing more than the wind whistling through empty buildings.”\n\nMazie’s uncle, Stephen O’Hern, tall, gaunt, elderly character-actor, coughed harshly. “Fools are skeptical of everything!” he rasped. “Wise men withhold judgment until a thing has been proved or disproved!”\n\nMarlow shot him a cold, contemptuous glance; that the two men disliked each other heartily was obvious.\n\nWith the exception of Mazie O’Hern, no member of the movie company liked Marlow, because of his insolent tongue and swaggering pose of superiority. “Tex” Lanning, leading man, detested him, as did Dave Parsons, the director.\n\nJim Boggs had noted these facts as his shrewd, deep-socketed gray eyes had studied his guests, gathered on the depot platform. “You don’t have to believe what I’ve told you about the spirits of Ghost-Town flittin’ around the old camp o’ nights,” he growled. “Some folks ‘low it’s the wind whistlin’ through buildings. Maybe it is, and again maybe it ain’t. You can decide that for yourselves!”\n\nJim proudly showed his guests faded old photographs of Caliente Rose, Mexican Molly, Poker-Chip O’Fallon and Big Watt Halperin, ex-residents of Ghost-Town.\n\nThe movie-actors were much interested in the pictures from a “character” angle, particularly Tex Banning, Dave Parsons and Stephen O’Hern, all expert “make-up” artists.\n\nMazie O’Hern had moved over beside Jim, on the platform. “I’m terribly interested to know something,” she whispered. “Which of those dance-hall girls did you like best, Mr. Boggs; Caliente Rose or Mexican Molly?”\n\nJim smiled in the moonlit darkness—a tender smile. His gaze shifted to Boothill Cemetery, rising somberly in the silvery gloom, north of Ghost-Town. “I—I always put flowers on the graves of both of ‘em,” he said gently.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nBig Walt Halperin\n\nWhen the gathering on the depot platform had broken Up, Boggs heard angry, lowered voices in the shadowy darkness of the Casino dance-hall. From behind a corner of the old building, he caught only a brief snatch of the quarrel, “…and if you don’t keep away from her, Marlow, you damn philandering phony, I’ll wring your neck!”\n\nThe speaker was Tex Banning.\n\nDave Parsons came hurrying up as the two actors began pummeling each other with fists. “You fellows get to your sleeping quarters!” he rasped. “I’m damned tired of your bickering! And I’m telling both of you again to keep away from Mazie O’Hern after working hours!”\n\n“That doesn’t seem to apply to you, Parsons,” sneered Marlow. “Mazie is the only friend I’ve got in this damned outfit! I intend to see her whenever it’s agreeable to her!” He strode away abruptly into the night.\n\n“The heel!” gritted Dave Parsons. “If he wasn’t a good actor, I’d give him the gate! Sometimes I’d like to wring his onery neck!”\n\n“You and me both, Boss,” growled Tex Lanning. “And one of these days I might do that little thing!”\n\nThe members of the movie company didn’t sleep much that night in the quarters Jim Boggs had allotted to them in the dust-filled, gloomy old Palace Hotel. From all directions came screechy, whistling, sobby noises. Bats darted squeakily about the ancient, crumbling buildings. Sand-owls hooted dismally along Main Street. Coyotes yelped hideously at the moon from lonely tragedy-haunted Boothill Cemetery.\n\nAlong toward midnight, Jim Boggs was jerked out of sound slumber by a piercing scream, followed by running footfalls along the hall. Somebody knocked frantically on his door. “Quick! Let me in!” cried a hysterical voice.\n\nJim flung open the door, and Mazie O’Hern almost fell into his arms. “That—that man, whose photograph you showed us, this evening, Big Walt Halperin, the old-time dance-hall owner! I—I looked out my window and saw him sneaking along near the hotel, in the moonlight! His—his face was exactly like the face on the old photograph—long black hair, black moustache, and—”\n\n“Bosh an’ nonsense!” growled Jim. “Big Watt Halperin has been in his grave on Boothill for years. Maybe his spirit wanders ‘round town, but I ain’t ever seen Big Watt personal! Now get back to your bed, an’ quit imaginin’ things!’”\n\nBut Mazie O’Hern was in no mood for slumber.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nBack From The Dead\n\nJim was trying to calm her nerves, when Lanning came striding into the room. Halting, he stared in surprise to find Mazie O’Hern there. “What’s wrong, honey? What are you doing here?” he questioned sharply.\n\n“I’m here, perhaps, for the same reason you are,” answered Mazie. “I don’t believe in spooks ordinarily, but—”\n\n“Nor do I,” snapped Tex. “Maybe you’ll think I’m crazy, but I’ll swear I saw a face peering into my room window, a few minutes ago, that looked like—”\n\n“Like the fellow whose photograph Boggs showed us this evening. Big Watt Halperin!” a voice interrupted from the doorway, and Dave Parsons came into the room. “I saw the fellow’s face distinctly, peering into my window, and—”\n\n“Funny,” growled Jim. “If three of you seen Big Watt Halperin, he must have been there, unless you’ve got the dangdest imaginations—”\n\n“I see face, too, senor Jim,” broke in a husky, guttural voice, and Mexican Joe Mendez joined the party. “I see Big Watt’s face plenty plain! Him look in at window, glare fierce! El Diablo send Big Watt back from Boothill to—”\n\nDexter Marlow came swaggering into the room, but his stride was less cocky than usual. Not far behind him was Mazie’s uncle, Stephen O’Hern. Both men had seen a face resembling the pictured likeness of Big Watt Halperin peering in at their windows.\n\n“Funny Big Watt didn’t drop ‘round an’ pay me a call, too,” scoffed Jim Boggs. “Danged if I don’t feel plumb neglected, bein’ passed up by my old friend, Watt, if he’s come back from the dead! Now you folks get back to your quarters an’ quit imaginin’ things! A walkin’ corpse! Bosh!”\n\nMarlow laughed raspily. “You’re not as neurotic as I imagined you were, Mr. Boggs,” he flung back, as he swaggered from the room.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Devil Hisself\n\nNext morning the corpse of the much-disliked Marlow was found sprawled on the floor of the dusty, cobwebbed Palace Hotel room where he had bedded himself, his eyes staring glassily up at the crumbling plaster ceiling. Apparently he had come to his death by strangulation.\n\nThe windows of the room were securely latched, and there were no footprints visible on the ground outside. Dust lay thick on the floor of the death room, and the footprints there were evidently Marlow’s.\n\n“Looks like the devil hisself has paid a visit to Ghost-Town,” muttered Jim Boggs, as he inspected the murder chamber. Bending over the actor’s body, his eyes widened with sudden surprise. In one rigid, clenched hand Marlow clutched several long, black hairs.\n\nReturning to his own room, Jim got the tarnished old badge he had once worn as Police Chief of Yucca City out of a dusty bureau drawer, polished it on his shirt sleeve and attached the badge to a suspender gallus.\n\nThen he walked slowly, thoughtfully up to Boothill Cemetery, and stood looking down at Big Watt Halperin’s weed-grown grave. “How in hell you could get flesh back on your skeleton bones, a suit of clothes on your back, an’ get out of that six-foot-deep hole, without disturbin’ the dirt is more than I can figger,” he muttered. “But you was such a danged schemin’ rascal, when you was runnin’ the Casino dance-hall an’ gamblin’-parlor; maybe you made a dicker with the devil to let you come back to Ghost-Town for a vacation!”\n\nOn his return trip from Boothill to Main Street, Jim was passing the Casino dance-hall when Mexican Joe Mendez hailed him from the dance-hall entrance. “You come quick, senor Jim! I got somethin’ to show you inside much queer!”\n\nJim followed Joe into the big barnlike structure that had once been the center of hilarious gaiety in Yucca City gold-rush days … hilarity and ghastly murder. Here and there under the floor-dust were ancient blood stains; dark-splotched reminders of violent knife and gun killings.\n\n“Look!” grunted Mexican Joe, pointing a gnarled forefinger. “Big Watt Halperin visit dance-hall last night!”\n\nAt one end of the room was a long mahogany bar, flanked by a big, ornately-framed mirror. The mirror was cracked in places, and heavily filmed with dust grime of passing years. Scrawled in the dust in the center of the mirror was a crudely drawn skull and cross-bones.\n\n“Umph!” exclaimed Jim. “I didn’t know Big Watt was an artist!” He strode behind the mahogany bar, followed noiselessly by Mexican Joe.\n\nJim noted that enough dust had been wiped from the left side of the mirror to permit a man to see his reflection clearly in the glass. He ran a forefinger nail through a gob of white, greasy substance on the mirror frame, and grunted. On the back bar, directly beneath the greasy, white substance on the mirror frame, was another gob of the same greasy substance.\n\n“Big Watt Halperin always was a vain damned cuss,” muttered Jim, “The walkin’ corpse evidently was here last night lookin’ at himself in the bar glass by candle light. He stuck the candle on the mirror frame, an’ it dripped that gob of grease on the back bar.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nThe Toupée\n\nMexican Joe had been doing some exploring on his own account. In one gnarled hand he clutched a large, black, hairy object, which he had found under the mahogany bar.\n\n“Well, shoot me for a rattler!” exclaimed Jim. “It looks like the one Big Walt Halperin bought years ago in Reno, to cover his shiny bald head!”\n\nExamining the toupee, Jim found small particles of candle-grease imbedded in the long, black hairs. “The lit candle stuck on the mirror frame must’ve dripped on the toupee while Big Watt was admirin’ himself in the glass,” he muttered. “Furthermore, the hair on this wig looks like the hairs I found in the hand of the dead actor, Marlow. Big Watt’s walkin’ corpse evident paid Marlow a visit.”\n\nMexican Joe took the toupee from Jim, grinning. “Me got bald head, too,” he said, and placed the wig on his nearly hairless pate. “Not so good fit—but I wear heem.”\n\n“You’re welcome to the dang wig,” chuckled Jim. “Gosh knows, I’ve got no use for a dead man’s old headpiece! Well…I’ve got to be movin’, Joe. I’ve got a movie actor’s corpse to look after over at the hotel.”\n\nAs Jim stomped out of the dance-hall into Main Street, a muffled cry of agony reached his ears, followed by loud groans. Running back into the Casino, he found Mexican Joe sprawled on the floor, blood trickling from a nasty scalp wound on the back of his head. The wig was gone from his bald skull. In his right hand, he clutched a sizable bunch of long, black hairs. When able to talk, he told Jim of being attacked and struck down from behind. He had grabbed at the wig, as it was snatched from his head.\n\n“Looks like Big Watt’s walkin’ corpse has come back from the grave to raise some sure ‘nough hell!” gritted Jim.\n\nHelping Mexican Joe over to the Palace Hotel, Jim left his friend’s head-wound to the tender ministrations of Mazie O’Hern, while he paid a visit to Marlow’s death room. To his surprise, he found the actor’s body had been removed during his absence.\n\n“Maybe Big Watt Halperin showed up here an’ packed the dead man up to Boothill graveyard to keep him company,” muttered Jim.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nA Halperin Look-Alike\n\nStepping into the hotel hallway, Boggs nearly collided with Director Dave Parsons. “What happened to Mister Marlow’s corpse?” he questioned the movie man sharply. “You ain’t met up with it roamin’ ‘round the hotel somewheres, have you?”\n\n“I—I took Marlow’s remains to the undertaker in Hassayampa,” informed Parsons. “After a brief examination, the coroner thought Marlow may have died of natural causes; a heart-attack.”\n\n“Then the coroner is damn dumb, or for reasons of his own he’s figurin’ to make a false report at the inquest!” snapped Jim. “The actor feller, Marlow, was murdered.”\n\nParsons seemed nervous and distraught. “We—we’ve got to go easy on this matter, Boggs,” he stammered. “It—it would be nasty publicity for my picture, if it got out that Marlow was—er—murdered. I have no reason to doubt the coroner’s assumption that—“\n\n“Bosh!” gritted Jim. Marlow was choked to death by a murderin’ killer! I’m still the law in Yucca City—all the law there is. An’ by thunderation, as long as I’ve got my old badge of office, I’m going to see that justice is done!”\n\nParsons knew that Jim meant what he said, but he was persistent. “Now see here, Boggs, can’t we get together on this unfortunate business? I don’t want any adverse publicity that will hurt the sale of my picture. If—if it’s a matter of money—“\n\n“It ain’t! It’s a matter of murder!” snapped Jim. “All I’m interested in is findin’ the rattler who killed Marlow.”\n\nDave let the matter drop for the moment. “By the way, Boggs. That old photograph of Big Watt Halperin you showed us last night—I’d like to borrow it. We’re taking some camera-shots of the Casino dance-hall, this afternoon, and I thought it would be a keen idea to have the dance-hall owner in the movie-play look like big Watt Halperin—a typical honky-tonk type of boomtown these days.”\n\n“Sure thing, I’ll loan you the photygraft,” agreed Jim. Big Watt was so dang vain, I wouldn’t be surprised if his walkin’ corpse would show up at the dance-hall an’ want to act in your picture!”\n\nParsons emitted a raspy chuckle. “You have a bizarre sense of humor, Mr. Boggs,” he commented acidly.\n\nThat afternoon, lighting and sound apparatus was set up in the big main room of the Casino dance-hall. The bar mirror had been cleaned of accumulated grime of years, and the actors were using the glass in applying make-up to their faces.\n\nStanley Ryerson, understudy to Dexter Marlow, had taken the dead man’s place in the movie play. Ryerson had disliked Marlow intensely because the deceased player had regarded the understudy’s acting with intolerant contempt. Now Ryerson was assuming Marlow’s role in the picture with intense satisfaction; Marlow’s passing seemed to exalt Ryerson rather than depress him.\n\nThree actors were preparing to “test out” for the role of Big Watt Halperin, dance-hall king, whose faded photograph stood on the back bar, to guide the thespians in applying their make-up. Those testing for the “bit” role were Tex Lanning, Stanley Ryerson and Stephen O’Hern.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nShootin’ To Be Done\n\nThe actors were absorbed in transferring the photograph likeness of Big Watt Halperin to their faces when Jim Boggs entered the Casino dance-hall with Mazie O’Hern. Mexican Joe Mendez shuffled along behind them, fingering the patch of court-plaster Mazie had applied to his scalp-wound.\n\n“Danged if Big Watt Halperin ain’t comin’ alive three times!” blurted Jim, staring at the actors’ faces reflected in the bar mirror.\n\n“It’s—it’s really uncanny!” exclaimed Mazie O’Hern. “If I was a man, I’d like to play the part of Big Watt Halperin, myself. He was such a thrilling person!”\n\n“Yeah. He was a thrillin’ person, all right,” drawled Jim “An’ also a killin’ one; he murdered six men, when he was runnin’ the old dance-hall in boom-town days.”\n\n“All right, boys,” snapped director Dave Parsons. “Don your wigs now, and we’ll make a still-camera test to decide which of you gets the role of Big Watt Halperin in the dance-hall scenes we’re shooting this afternoon.”\n\nThe three actors finished applying their make-up, and donned black-haired wigs like the one Big Watt Halperin had worn when Yucca City was at its zenith.\n\nMazie O’Hern shuddered. “They —they look exactly like the creature I saw outside my hotel window last night!” she exclaimed.\n\n“Yeah. I reckon so,” agreed Jim Boggs gruffly. “Big Watt was so dang vain, he would be mighty proud an’ puffed up to see himself three times in a row. I wouldn’t be surprised if his walkin’ corpse has come down from Boothill an’ is takin’ a peek at his actor duplicates through a dance-hall window!”\n\nHeads of the assembled movie actors pivoted around jerkily on necks, but the Casino windows stared back at them blankly.\n\n“Okay, men—now for the test,” ordered Dave Parsons, and the actors lined up before the waiting camera.\n\n“Shoot the picture, Tony,” snapped Parsons.\n\n“Jest a minute!” interrupted a gruff voice. “If there’s any shootin’ to be done, I’ll do it!”\n\nJim Boggs stepped swiftly in front of the camera; jerked a wig from the head of one of the actors; shoved his old Colt .45 against the thespian’s stomach. “I arrest you for the murder of the Marlow feller you choked to death last night in his hotel room,” he rasped.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nMy Hands Were At His Throat\n\nCommotion swept the Casino dance-hall like a conflagration. “He—he must be crazy!” cried out Mazie O’Hern, horrified. “It’s ridiculous to accuse—”\n\n“The old coot has gone nuts!” blurted Tex Lanning; “He imagines he’s back in his police-chief days!”\n\n“What’s the meaning of this damn foolishness?” shouted Parsons. “You’re insane, Boggs!”\n\n“On the contrary,” said Stephen O’Hern, the character actor, grimly, “Mr. Boggs isn’t indulging in foolishness nor is he the victim of an addled imagination; as a matter of fact, he has delivered the goods.”\n\nFrom a pocket of his faded, patched old coat, ex-Police-Chief Jim Boggs drew a pair of handcuffs and clipped them on the wrists of the actor who had played the role of murderer in many a stage and movie play.\n\n“O.K., Sheriff Hopperson! Come an’ get your prisoner!” he shouted.\n\nFrom a rear room of the dance-hall strode the sheriff of Hassayampa County. Jim had sent Mexican Joe to fetch the law-officer earlier that afternoon.\n\n“Good work, Boggs,” commended the lawman. “And now, maybe you’ll do us the honor to explain how you caught this killer.”\n\n“Glad to accommodate,” said Jim. “Fact is, I didn’t know who the killer was till a few minutes ago. When the actor gents put on them wigs, I figgered I had my man. For one thing, there was a patch of hair missin’ from the killer’s headpiece; the hair Mexican Joe yanked out of the wig, when the killer sneaked up behind him, grabbed the wig an’ busted him on the head. Joe didn’t get a look at the murderin’ varmint. Last night, standin’ before the bar-mirror, the killer made himself up to look like Big Watt Halperin. He stuck a candle on the mirror frame an’ some of the grease drippings from the candle dropped on his wig, as you can see by them particles imbedded in the hair. When he had fixed himself up to look like Big Watt, he come snoopin’ ‘round the Palace Hotel, scarin’ hell out of folks.\n\n“As for the murder,” concluded Jim, “Marlow, the actor, was clutch-in’ some black hairs in a dead hand; had evident yanked the wig off the killer’s head before—”\n\n“Precisely, Mr. Boggs,” interrupted a somber voice. “Marlow jerked the wig from my head before he died—but I didn’t strangle the rat, as you believe. I intended to kill him, but he died of a shock; heart-failure. Last night, when you showed us Big Watt Halperin’s photograph, I decided to put my talent for makeup to a test. After frightening folks a bit, peering into the hotel windows, I removed my make-up and appeared among you, pretending that I, too, had seen the ghostly visitor. Marlow had lost some of his swagger; he half believed Big Watt Halperin had returned from the dead. Later, again assuming the role of Big Watt, I burst into Marlow’s room; he attacked me, tearing the wig from my head, then sagged limply. My hands were at his throat, but he was dead before—”\n\n“Why did you want to kill Marlow?” broke in Boggs sharply.\n\n“Because I despised the low-life cheat and philanderer!” rasped Stephen O’Hern. “I wanted to protect my niece, Mazie; tongues were wagging, when we left Hollywood for the Nevada Desert. My niece is slated for stardom in pictures, and—”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nThe Tarnished Old Badge\n\nWith an agonized cry, Mazie O’Hern flung her arms about her uncle.\n\n“There, there now, child,” he soothed gently. “Try to forgive a miserable old fool for—”\n\nHis voice broke in a low moan.\n\nTex Lanning drew Mazie away from her uncle, comforting her. Her arms went about the young actor, as she had embraced him in many movie love-scenes. This time it wasn’t play-acting.\n\nStephen O’Hern’s head was bowed; his face sorrowfully tragic.\n\n“I—I don’t allow the Law will be too hard on you, Mister O’Hern,” Jim Boggs said gently. “I figger maybe you’ll get off light, as we’re fair an’ square in dealin’ out justice in Hassayampa County.”\n\nJim removed the tarnished old police-chief badge from his suspender-gallus and looked at it affectionately. Sighing heavily he thrust it into a pocket of his faded, shabby old coat.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

At\nleast that’s the way I’ve come to feel about it, though I sure could be\nwrong, judging by the opinions of a few old cranks around Hoskinsville\nwho say I’ve got too many funny ideas to be editor of the Hoskinsville\nClarion. But the old cranks are very much in the minority in our town,\nand even if they weren’t, I started the paper eighteen years ago, come\nnext spring, and I’m going to run it the way I been running it as long\nas I got ink and can find a linotype man.\n\nAnyhow, I wasn’t thinking of all the hell and misery just one little\nmurder can let loose in the world the night I stopped at Margot Graham’s\ncottage. I was too busy with my own thoughts, too afraid someone would\nsee me come here.\n\nMaybe you’re wondering why a waddling, wheezing, pink-fleshed fellow of\nfifty-five like me would be sneaking into Margot Graham’s cottage. Well,\nsometimes I wondered myself. My wife died five years ago, but I’ve got\ntwo fine kids who’d have been awful crushed to see their old man\nslinking along that walk toward the white cottage that gleamed faintly\nin the night. I felt like hell myself. I’d been to the cottage once\nbefore.\n\nI’d known even while I was going there the first time that it was pure\ninsanity. But, brother, you ain’t seen Margot Graham. Anyhow, tonight\nshe’d commanded me to come there. That’s right—commanded. And I was\ngoing, remembering her phone call, her hard tinkling laugh.\n\nIn my pocket I carried a thousand dollars. It was a stiff price for a\nman of my meager means to pay for her silence about that other visit,\nbut over the phone she’d given me to know that I had no choice.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nOnly Me And Margot Graham\n\nMy hand felt cold as I turned the knob, then I closed if the door behind\nme, feeling like a fish meshed in a heavy net.\n\nA crack of light showed under a door to my left, and I knew she’d be in\nthere in the living room, all the blinds drawn, the lighting soft. I\nknocked on the door, got no answer.\n\nI tried the knob and the door swung open. She was there in the living\nroom, waiting for me, all right. But she wouldn’t have waited all\ncrumpled up on the floor like that.\n\nI got inside the room and closed the door fast. I was in here with\nmurder, I realized as I bent over her. And yet, even with that chilling\nthought going like lightning across my mind, my pulses raced, just\nlooking at her.\n\nI shook myself, swallowed some of the tightness out of my throat. The\nsultry light had left those violet eyes now and the midnight hair was\nstreaked with crimson. She’d been hit once just over the temple. Once\nhad been enough. Then I saw the cigar band lying on the floor and bent\nto pick it up. I looked at it, dropped it in my pocket. Then I gave the\nroom the once-over. There was no cigar in any of the ashtrays, no sign\nof a murder weapon. Only me and Margot Graham, and the living room she’d\nfurnished in square, pastel furniture and softly glowing lamps when\nshe’d first come to Hoskinsville.\n\nEnough of the paralysis left me for me to stagger back out of the room.\nIn the hallway I waited awhile in the darkness, just shivering and\ntrying not to think. Then I opened the front door.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nMurder\n\nThe street was quiet, deserted. I crossed the small porch, ran across\nthe lawn to keep my footsteps from echoing on the walk. I was running\nlike hell, but two blocks away my mind began working again and I slowed\nto a walk. I took the cigar band I’d found beside Margot Graham from the\nside pocket of my coat. A little of her blood was on it and I shuddered.\nThen I crammed the band deep into the left pocket of my coat, headed for\nthe Clarion office.\n\nWhen I closed the door behind me, the smell of paper and ink washed\npleasantly over me. My desk was over to one side, piled high. A stack of\nyellowed papers was in the corner, and it seemed you could never find\nanything in the cluttered office. In eighteen years you accumulate a lot\nof stuff and every time I thought of cleaning the place I couldn’t make\nup my mind what to throw away. So it just kept piling up.\n\nI took off my coat, hung it on a nail over my desk. I heard a movement\nbehind me and whirled around, jerking. It was Willie Lance, my reporter\nand associate editor. He’d just come through the short corridor from the\ncomposing room.\n\nHe looked at me and said, ‘‘What’s wrong, Cass? You look as if you’d\nseen a ghost.” He was a short, thin young fellow with big ears and a\nlong nose. His parents had died several years ago and Matt O’Toole—who\nis Hoskinsville —had sort of taken Willie under his wing. Matt had sent\nWillie off to school, but Willie’d come back, gone to work for me.\n\nI made some damfool reply to Willie about having indigestion. I washed\nmy hands and put water on my head. I don’t really think I expected the\ncold water to drive the vision of Margot Graham’s lifeless body from my\nmind. I was just stalling, getting myself together.\n\nThen I realized what I might be doing to myself. The longer I stalled,\nthe worse it was going to look for me if it came out that I’d been in\nMargot Graham’s cottage. I wheezed back to the long, gloomy office.\nWillie had sat down at his desk, run a sheet of paper in his ramshackle\ntypewriter, and was lighting a cigarette, preparatory to starting on the\nsports page. His chair scraped back sharply as I picked up the phone and\ngave the operator Sheriff Raymond Nord’s number.\n\nWillie came over beside me. “What’s up, Cass? Why’re you calling the\nSheriff?”\n\n“Murder,” I said.\n\n“What … !”\n\nAt the other end of the line, Nord said, “Hullo.”\n\n“This is Cass Bailey, Raymond. Skedaddle right over here.”\n\nWillie tugged at my arm, his eyes wide over his long nose. “Who?”\n\nI shook his hand off my arm, said into the phone: “Raymond, you get the\nhell over here. I’ll guarantee to wake you up!”\n\n“Can’t you tell me … ?”\n\n“I’ll tell you when you get here!” I shouted.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Man With A Public Trust\n\nI replaced the phone, and Willie was fairly jumping in his pants. “Who\ngot killed, Cass? And who did it? Are we going to run an extra? How … ”\n\n“Just keep your shirttail in. We ain’t going any place until Raymond\nNord gets here. Somebody murdered Margot Graham, but we ain’t running a\nscandal-sheet, Willie. You’ll get your chance to write up the facts that\nNord finds.”\n\nHe shrugged helplessly, crestfallen, and sat down and chain-smoked until\nRaymond Nord slammed the office door rattlingly behind him.\n\nWillie jumped about three feet off the floor. “It’s Margot Graham,\nsheriff! She’s been murdered!”\n\nRaymond drew up stiffly, looked from Willie to me.\n\nI nodded. “She’s at her cottage. I found her.”\n\n“You!”\n\nI sat down on the edge of my desk. “About a month ago, just a day or two\nafter she’d got in town, Margot Graham came to the office to take a\nsubscription to the paper. Willie was out and nobody was back in the\ncomposing room, and my stomach was bothering me. So when I took a little\nnip—strictly for my stomach, you know— she sort of invited herself to\none, and …” Face burning, I couldn’t go on.\n\nRaymond Nord leaned his grizzled length toward me, his slate-colored\neyes as wide as they would go in their crinkles of wind-burned skin.\n“You’re trying to tell me, Cass, that you … .”\n\n“All right,” I said hoarsely, “I played the part of an old fool. We had\na drink or two and got sort of … well, chummy. It was like being\ndrugged. She left the office and a day or two passed. I kept seeing her\nface every which way I’d look—even overhead in the darkness when I’d lay\nin bed and couldn’t sleep. So the third night after she was here … well,\nI didn’t have anything to do. I just sort of found myself going toward\nher house. I was crazy, I’ll admit. But I’m just a human, Raymond … .”\n\n“And a damn weak one at that,” Raymond said.\n\n“That’s right.” I guess I came close to moaning it. “I knocked on her\ndoor. Then I knew what a fool I was being. I guessed she’d laugh at me.\nBut before I could turn and run, she opened the door, and she didn’t\nlaugh at all. Well, she laughed, but not amused, mocking laughter like I\nthought she’d laugh. She invited me in, and I couldn’t have turned from\nthat door if there’d been a million horses dragging me, helping me get\naway from there.”\n\nRaymond didn’t snort derisively. He’d seen Margot Graham, like everybody\nelse in town. He waited quietly.\n\n“We just sat and talked,” I finished lamely. “So help me. She let me\nfeel welcome, but at the same time she made me aware that I was old\nenough to be her pa. Then I left, and that’s all there was to it until\nthis afternoon. She phoned me, and she wasn’t so nice. She was brittle\nand tough. She wanted a thousand dollars or she was going to start a\nstorm of gossip and scandal that would ruin me. And in a town as small\nas Hoskinsville she could have done it.”\n\n“And you a man with a public trust like a newspaper,” Raymond added\nsagely, “and with two kids you wanted to protect. Sure … she knew you’d\npay off. What then?”\n\n“I went to her house with the thousand dollars. It’s in my pocket now.\nShe was dead. And that’s all, so help me.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nIncriminating Evidence\n\nRaymond looked at me a long time and the hairs on the back of my neck\nand all along my arms were like pins. Then he said quietly, “I’ll call a\ndeputy and the coroner and we’ll go over to her house.”\n\nI rose heavily, my back sticky with sweat. While Nord phoned a deputy,\nWillie Lance stuck a pencil behind each one of his big ears, stuffed his\ncoat pocket full of yellow paper; we left a small light burning, locked\nthe office door, and got in Raymond Nord’s car.\n\nMargot Graham lay just as I had left her, arm outflung, crimson nails\nbiting into the carpet, the soft light somehow glaring and harsh with\nthe presence of death. I sat down and kept my face turned away. Nord\ninspected the room, while Willie shivered and stared in horrified\nfascination at death.\n\nNord left the room and I heard his footsteps all around in the back part\nof the cottage. He came back in the living room. “Her bedroom’s been\ntorn to pieces, drawers dumped on the floor, mattress ripped, even the\ncarpet pulled off the floor in a pile. Somebody was sure hunting\nsomething.”\n\n“Think they found it?” Willie said.\n\nNord bobbed his sandy-haired, shaggy head. “A picture has been torn off\nthe wall. Behind it, Margot Graham had cut into the wall and inset a\nsteel strongbox. Somebody was evidently hunting the key to the box and\nfound it. The box was on the floor, open, the key in the lock, empty.”\n\nHe planted his feet wide before me. ‘‘You wouldn’t know anything about\nthat, Cass?”\n\nI shook my head vehemently. “Raymond, I told you the whole mess, so help\nme. Can’t you see? I’m not the only one Margot shook down. That was her\nracket, simple and profitable. But somebody kicked, killed her, and took\nwhatever incriminating evidence she had against him from the strong\nbox.”\n\nThere was a sound at the doorway and Raymond’s lank deputy came in.\nRaymond gave the deputy instructions to stick around until the coroner\ncame, added that it was apparently a clean kill with no clues; then as\nwe went out, Willie almost tripping on my heels, Nord added: “As I was\nsaying, maybe she came here to shake a few of you old fools down. I’m\ninclined to believe it. But the day she came here I started checking on\nher, quietly. She had a double motive in coming here, Cass. She had her\nlittle racket—and this is the hometown of her former husband. It was\nmade to order—a small town where they’d gossip about anything and a\nlittle gossip would ruin anybody and, in case she ran into difficulties\nand needed legal help, an ex-husband who is the finest legal brains in\nthe state.”\n\nI stopped in my tracks. “Not Gerald Winison!”\n\nRaymond nodded, and even in the darkness I could almost see his face\ntightening, growing grey, haggard.\n\n“Gerald Winison!” Willie breathed. “Golly, what a story!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA Hypnotic Trance\n\nWe drove across the middle of Hoskinsville. It was Matt O’Toole’s town,\nwho called its people his children, some of whom had gone out to win\nfame. One of whom had been married to Margot Graham. I wondered if\nthey’d mention Gerald Winison for governor after tonight.\n\nWe drew up before Gerald’s small brick bungalow, got out. We waited, and\nI could feel Raymond Nord’s reluctance. Then with a sigh he started for\nthe door.\n\nGerald’s young auburn-haired wife answered the door and Raymond twisted\nhis hat in his hand. “I’d like to see Jerry, Mrs. Winison.”\n\nShe smiled, said hello to all of us, and added: “Come in please.”\n\n“No,” Raymond said. “I can talk to Jerry out here.”\n\nHe came to the door after a moment, a tall, husky young man in his\nshirtsleeves. His dark, crinkly hair was mussed, his eyes sparkling.\n“Hello, fellows. Been upstairs in the kid’s room, wrestling with the\nlittle rascal. He … .”\n\n“Come outside, Jerry,” Raymond said heavily, and Jerry’s words cut off\nin his throat. He stepped out, closed the door behind him.\n\n“I didn’t want your wife to hear this, Jerry, but Margot Graham’s dead.”\n\n“It was murder,” Willie, standing at my elbow, added.\n\nJerry finally said, “When?”\n\n“Tonight,” Raymond said. “I want to talk to you, Jerry. Tell your wife\nyou’ll be coming back later.”\n\nJerry turned stiffly, opened the door, poked his head in, and told his\nwife he would be back after awhile. We went down the walk to the\nsheriff’s car. I could sense the questions on Jerry’s lips, but he\ndidn’t say anything.\n\nThe sheriff started the car, began cruising slowly down the dark street.\n“Want to tell me, Jerry? I know that you were married to her. I found\nthat out not long after she got in town.”\n\n“Yes,” Jerry said. “I was married to her. But I divorced her. Peg—my\npresent wife—knows all about it.” Somehow he spoke too loudly.\n\n“Yeah,” Raymond remarked almost sadly. “The day she came to town, for\ninstance, I had a hunch Margot Graham was up to no good. So I went to\nthe train station, checked the point of origin of her ticket. From there\nit wasn’t too hard, sending wires, making a couple phone calls. You\nbetter tell me the whole thing, Jerry.”\n\n“Why not?” Jerry said with a faint, bitter laugh. “After this thing\nbreaks I’ll be washed up anyway. I’ll have to leave Hoskinsville and all\nthat I’ve built here and take my family some place else.\n\n“I thought I’d got over Margot Graham when I came to Hoskinsville,”\nJerry was saying softly. “I married Peg and pitched in to work. It’s\nbeen five years since then, short years. I knew they were over the\nmoment I passed Margot on the street, a day or two after she’d come\nhere. She’d seen my picture in a newspaper, she said, and had decided to\ntake a look in my new hometown. She asked me to come to her house, and\nlike a spineless rat … .”\n\n“… In a hypnotic trance,” Raymond said heavily.\n\n“Yes,” Jerry’s voice shook. “In a hypnotic trance I went to her house. I\ntalked to her a few minutes, left. Somehow I was over it; I didn’t want\nto go back again. That night at home with Peg I knew I was cured of\nMargot Graham once and for all. Then she called me. And what could I do?\nHave the whole town know I’d slipped to my former wife’s house under\ncover of night? Try to convince them that it hadn’t meant anything, that\nI was cured of her?” His laugh, again, was bitter. “I might as well\ntried holding a hurricane in a fragile china teacup! If Margot said the\nthings she said she would, I knew I was a ruined man.”\n\n“So you went back,” Raymond said.\n\n“Yes,” it was almost a whisper. “I went back. Again, and then again. And\nshe told me she’d hit a gold mine, that she didn’t know so many yokels\njust waiting to be shaken down existed in one town. She was going to\ntrim … the whole bunch of us. And I was going to be her legal aid if she\nneeded it—or else. Her first collection, she said, was going to be fifty\nthousand dollars.”\n\n“Fifty thousand!” Willie, I, and Sheriff Nord said it almost at once.\nRaymond added: “Who the hell in Hoskinsville would have that kind of\nmoney?”\n\n“She didn’t say,” Jerry’s tortured voice went on.\n\n“You didn’t know any of the men, Jerry?”\n\nI squirmed in the back seat. Jerry didn’t answer for quite awhile, then\nhe whispered, “The only one she ever named was Doctor Daniel Hastings.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nI Was Awfully Lonely\n\nThe house of Doctor Daniel Hastings was quiet with the chill calm of\ndeath. All the bright lights in the long quietly-furnished living room\ncouldn’t dispel the cloud that hung perpetually over the place. Or maybe\nit was just because I knew that upstairs lay Dam’s wife. She hadn’t\nwalked in almost ten years since her automobile accident, and Dan had\noperated seven times, each time knowing it would take one more operation\nto cure her. And through all the pain, she never lost her smile, the\nworship in her eyes, the expression on her wasted face telling the world\nthat next time Dan would succeed … .\n\nDan invited us in. His eyes clouded a trifle as he looked from one to\nthe other of us, saying hello, his strong, surgeon’s hands hanging\nstiffly at his sides. “Sit down, gentlemen.”\n\nRaymond shook his head, and we remained standing, a little knot just\ninside the doorway. Raymond said, “Can your wife hear us?”\n\nDan Hastings frowned. “No. She’s fixed for the night, upstairs, with the\nnurse. But why … .”\n\n“I just wanted to spare her listening to what we’ve got to say to each\nother,” Raymond said. “Margot Graham has been murdered. You’re not going\nto deny that you knew her?”\n\nDan looked from one to the other of us. “No. I’m not going to deny it.”\nHe turned his bald head so that his face was tilted away from us. His\nvoice was low, thick: “I knew—I suppose I knew even while I was seeing\nher that it would come to this sometime.”\n\nRaymond said, “How many times did you see her Dan?”\n\n“Twice.” He looked up slowly, his eyes burning with self-condemnation.\n“I’m not going to ask any of you to understand. Always in the past I’ve\nlost myself in my work. In the clinics. I’ve managed to crush the\nhopelessness and despair of watching my wife lie week after week,\nhelpless and hurting, and being unable to help her, crush it just by\nworking until I dropped.\n\n“I’ll not ask you to understand,” he said again. “But I was tired of\npain and hopelessness and despair. I … I guess I was awfully lonely.\nThen one day Margot Graham walked into my office. I lost my sense.”\n\n“… In a hypnotized trance,” Raymond Nord remarked heavily. “Then she put\nthe pressure on you for a shakedown, Dan?”\n\nAgain his blue eyes went over us. He nodded.\n\n“How much did she want?” Nord asked.\n\n“Fifty thousand dollars?”\n\nDan laughed grimly. “Where would I get that kind of money? Every dime I\nmake has a place to go.” He could have added that it was because he got\npaid in dimes mostly.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nAll Our Names Were Coming Out\n\n“There’s just one thing I want to ask, sheriff,” Dan Hastings said.\n“Don’t let my wife know. I’ll take what’s coming to me—but it would kill\nher.”\n\n“I’ll not let her know,” Raymond said. But each of us knew it was a\npromise he couldn’t keep, possibly. There’d have to be a trial … . And\nno matter who finally got the noose around his neck, all our names were\ncoming out.\n\nRaymond said, “You go along upstairs and tell your wife you’ve got to be\nout a while, Dan. We’ll wait outside in my car.”\n\nWhen Dan came back, he got in the back seat with Willie and me. Willie\nhad turned on the overhead light in the car, was scribbling furiously on\nhis yellow paper. He looked up, eyes shining with excitement, face\nflushed.\n\n“What a story! What a story! Now I’ll drop the bombshell. The next stop,\ngents, is Matt O’Toole’s house!”\n\nWe almost went through the top of the car. “You’re crazy, Willie!”\n\n“That’s a lie, Willie!”\n\n“You’re letting your marbles spill, Willie!”\n\n“No,” Willie said. “I ain’t crazy, and I ain’t lying. I … .”\n\n“He’s not,” I said heavily. I ran my hands in the pockets of my coat,\npulled the cigar band that I’d found beside Margot Graham from the right\nhand pocket. “I was hoping you’d get a confession maybe before now,\nRaymond. I wasn’t intending to hold out on you, but I didn’t want to\nshow you this until I had to.”\n\nI handed him the cigar band.\n\n“Everybody around town knows that Matt O’Toole smokes that brand. I\nfound it beside her body. That’s her … her blood on it.”\n\nRaymond folded the band slowly, slipped it in his vest pocket. “She sure\nmust have been some woman. Even after she’s dead, she’s tearing the\nfoundations right out from under Hoskinsville—you, Cass, our honest,\nfighting newspaper man, Jerry, the lad with the playgrounds, teenage\nclubs, the fighter for civic betterment, Dan the crusading doctor, and\nnow Matt O’Toole, who built the damn town in the first place!”\n\nRaymond turned to Willie. “How come you to think of Matt?”\n\n“I heard him couple days ago when I went up to his place for a story. He\nwas talking over the phone to her. ’Sides, Matt O’Toole is the logical\nguy to be taken for as much as fifty thousand. He’s rich.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nMatt O’Toole\n\nYou’d never have known it by looking at him. Matt ushered us into his\nsweeping living room with its rustic furniture with a hearty hello. He\nwas a strapping, freckled, red-headed Irishman, his hair flying like a\nwild flag. Some doctor had told Matt thirty years ago that he might live\nsix more months by coming to the hills. Matt had come; he was still\nalive. He’d transformed the hill wilderness into a city bustling about\nthe woolen homespun textile industry. O’Toole mountain homespuns were\nknown the world over, the choice fabric of elite tailors in New York.\n\nAnd in building his industry, which he’d started from hand looms in\nrough mountain cabins, and his city, Matt O’Toole had never lost sight\nof the human element. He believed in parks and churches and good\nschools. He believed in good working conditions and clean government.\nJerry had built playgrounds, but Matt’s money had backed him. Dan had\nfought for the clinics, but Matt was really the general in the campaign.\n\nNow he shook our hands warmly and invited us to drink his whiskey, but\nRaymond said awkwardly: “Some other time, Matt. We got important things\non our minds. Margot Graham has been murdered.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nThe Cigar Band\n\nMatt sat down, squinting his blue eyes, running his hand through his\nshock of wild red hair. “You think I had something to do with it?”\n\nNord took a long, deep breath. I wished I was out of here, wished I’d\nnever heard of Margot Graham. I knew Jerry and Dan felt the same way.\nWillie was all ears, literally and figuratively. Raymond Nord said\nfinally: “I know you knew her, Matt. I know she was trying to shake you\ndown for fifty thousand dollars.”\n\nMatt looked from one to the other of us. His eyes were grave, even\nalarmed, but he managed a chuckle.\n\n“A pack of old fools!” he said, shaking his head. “She wasn’t trying to\nshake me down. She did it! I guess I just love Irish whiskey too much.\nHell, I even promised her in writing that I’d marry her!”\n\n“And she got the fifty thousand?” Raymond asked.\n\n“Got it two days ago,” Matt said.\n\n“But you didn’t kill her?”\n\n“No,” Matt said, “I didn’t kill her. I just looked things flat in the\nface, realized I’d been an old fool in a … .”\n\n“… Hypnotic trance,” Raymond supplied dourly.\n\n“That’s right,” Matt said. “She did sort of hypnotize me. You never knew\nher well, Raymond? She was an angel, with a core right out of Satan’s\nheart. She was a lady, and a black-hearted schemer. She was a princess,\nand a ruthless guttersnipe.”\n\nRaymond looked at us and said, “None of you did anything wrong,\nactually. But, you know, one of you is a murderer.”\n\nWe looked at each other then, and the room grew cold. I sat down.\nRaymond walked over to the phone, called the coroner. He talked a few\nmoments, then came back to face us. “She was killed between six and nine\ntonight. You, Jerry, where were you?”\n\n“Home,” Jerry said. “I’d had a hard day at the office.”\n\n“Can you prove it?”\n\n“My wife was there, and the maid.”\n\nRaymond turned to Dan. “And you?”\n\n“I was at the hospital,” Dan said. “I called my house at five-thirty,\nthen went directly up to my surgery. I left there at about eight, went\ndown to consult with Dr. Lamb until after nine. I’d got home just before\nyou came. Three or four doctors and half a dozen nurses can prove I\nnever left the hospital between six and nine.”\n\n“And you, Matt?”\n\n“At the plant,” Matt said decisively, “having a little conference with a\nsuperintendent and a couple of foremen.”\n\nRaymond turned to me and my mouth got dry and I felt empty right down to\nmy toes. Between six and nine I’d been alone. Until I’d found her body\nright about nine o’clock.\n\nI hunched down in my chair listening to the silence in the room, feeling\ntheir eyes on me. I pushed my hands down hard in my coat pockets; then I\ncame out of the chair with a jump that startled them all.\n\n“Where was Willie?” I demanded.\n\nWillie jerked so hard the pencils fell from behind his ears. “What do\nyou mean, Cass Bailey?” he shouted.\n\nI grabbed him by the collar, shook him. “You killed her, you little rat.\nMatt O’Toole put you in college and you were too rotten to stay there.\nTonight you slipped into her house and killed her! We’ve been thinking\nof the shakedown angle as a motive—but what about the fifty thousand\nMatt gave her? She knew you, maybe recognized in you a rat she could\nuse! And you slunk around until you’d learned of the fifty thousand. You\ntore her bedroom to pieces hunting for it, found it in the strongbox\nhidden in the wall behind the picture! She came in, surprised you, and\nyou caught her in the living room and killed her.\n\n“If Matt wasn’t in her house tonight, the band from his cigar must have\nbeen planted. You took the band with you to plant, Willie. You intended\nto drop it in the bedroom where she’d find it. She’d recognize it as\nMatt’s, and since she and Matt were supposed to be the only ones who\nknew he had actually given her fifty thousand dollars, you were banking\non her jumping to the conclusion that he’d been there, got his money\nback. But it didn’t work out that way. She came home earlier than you’d\nthought she would. And you killed her. Then you decided still to use the\nband, but for a different plant, a murder plant.” He jerked out of my\ngrip, moved back. “You’re crazy, Cass Bailey. Any of you could have\nplanted the cigar band!”\n\n“Yes, Willie,” I said, “but you did. You knew she was mixed with\nimportant men. You wanted to get enough of the important men involved to\nmake the investigation a hush-hush affair, so in a few days you could\nskip out with the money. To keep the affair as squelched as possible you\nwanted all of us in as bad a light as possible; that’s why you left the\ncigar band on me, in my pocket! Isn’t that the truth Willie?”\n\n“You’re crazy!” Willie shouted again. “I didn’t touch the band!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nMay She Rest In Peace\n\n“I can prove you did, Willie. You were the only person who had access to\nmy coat—while it was hanging over my desk when I went back to the\nwashroom just after I’d come in the office. You went through my pockets,\nfound the band. But you made the mistake of putting the band back in the\nwrong pocket. The band was in the left pocket of my coat when I entered\nthe office, but it was in the right pocket of my coat when I reached for\nit to hand it to Sheriff Nord!\n\n“If you’re in the clear, Willie, why did you go in my pockets in the\nfirst place? You were hoping the sheriff would find the band on me or\nthat I’d have to hand it over. Every little item to make it look blacker\nplayed in your favor … but, Willie, you know some place in her house you\nmust have left fingerprints. Even after she’s gone, she and her house\nwill finger you and … .”\n\nWith a sharp cry Willie lunged back, his hand diving under his coat\ntoward a gun. He brought the gun up, fired, hit the wall. He steadied\nhimself in a split instant, while we were trying to get in motion. He’d\nnot miss this time.\n\nBut another gun spoke, Raymond Nord’s, and a tiny black hole jumped into\nbeing in the bridge of Willie’s long nose. The hole disappeared in a\nflood of crimson, and somewhere in his short fall to the floor Willie\nLance died.\n\nWe stood looking at his crumpled heap, wiping our faces and shivering a\nlittle. Nobody spoke for a few moments; then Raymond Nord said: “Funny\nhow a man can think a million thoughts between two ticks of a watch,\nwhile Willie was getting set to pull the trigger again.”\n\nHe looked from one to the other of us dourly. “Thoughts about a nice\ntown filled with swell people and the old fools who have made it.\nThoughts about kids in playgrounds, people in white, airy clinic and\nmodern hospital, about a newspaper that’s never let a city official get\nout of line, about the red-headed ruffian behind it all.”\n\nHe sighed heavily. “I even thought about Jerry’s wife and kid, Cass’ two\noffspring, Dan’s wife and her faith in him that he’ll justify one of\nthese days. So …” he shrugged his lean shoulders. “If Willie hadn’t made\nthe break he’d have got a trial. Trials bring to light a lot of things,\ninnocent things, but things that would have enabled Margot Graham to\ndrag everything I was thinking about right down into the grave with her.\nBut since Willie did make the break …\n\nMatt said, “It was your life or his.”\n\nMatt turned then and began pouring whiskey. We needed it. Jerry looked\nat his jigger. “To Margot Graham,” he said.\n\nDan added: “May she rest in peace.”\n\n“She won’t,” I said.\n\n“No,” Matt O’Toole said, “she wasn’t that kind.”\n\n“And,” Raymond Nord muttered, “neither was Willie.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

It has\nbeen all of a half century since I assisted the doctor’s father, old\nDoc. Wright, in separating it from its trunk that dark, stormy night out\nin the weed-grown potters’ field. Yet, last night, when I looked at the\ngrisly relic, the face wore the same wolfish grin that it had borne in\nlife, the fangs were skinned back ferociously like the tusks of an angry\nboar, and the one good eye—the other had been gouged out in a fight\nyears before—glared malevolently, insolently, leeringly, as if, even in\ndeath, the owner found a certain grim pleasure in cheating the law which\nhad declared that head and body must remain intact.\n\nJim Dickinson’s body has, in the natural course of events, long been\nincorporated with the black earth slime from which it came. Over it, the\nloathsome worms have long since ceased to hold their ghoulish revelry.\nHis filthy soul is without doubt in the hell it created for itself. As\nfor his head—the head he lost to Doc. Wright in a poker game, and which\nthe whisky-sodden old physic dispenser claimed from the grave rather\nthan brave the unspeakable wrath of the dead outlaw—that is another\nstory. Doc wanted the head because of the thickness of the skull, which\nhad withstood, without cracking, a tattoo from the butt end of a\nrevolver in the hands of a frenzied man. And Dickinson wanted him to\nhave it, because it had been fairly won and the only point of honor he\never observed was the payment of his gambling debts. It is of Jim\nDickinson’s malformed headland the black cat with the devil’s temper,\nand Creole May, the outcast, that this story is written.\n\n&amp;lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&amp;gt;Back to Top&amp;lt;/h6&amp;gt;\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nA Thing Of Evil\n\nWhere Jim Dickinson was spawned, or whelped—or whatever the inception of\nan anomaly like him can be called—is a question. My personal opinion is\nthat he was never born—that he was created from the slimy, green frog\nspit that gathers in a scum on stagnant muck—but the preachers will\nprobably take issue with me on that point. At any rate, I know of my own\nknowledge that there were more maggots of deviltry squirming inside the\nblackness of his skull than could ever exist in the same space in hell.\n\nJim Dickinson made his first bid for our attention by appearing in Black\nPeter’s saloon one dark, stormy night—a big, hulking figure of a man\nwith a broken, hooked nose and a black, tangled thatch of whiskers. His\nhuge, misshapen head stuck out, turtle-wise, on a thick, bull neck. His\nthin, cruel lips were drawn back in a snarl of vindictive hatred of the\nworld in general, over yellowed fangs so large as to almost appear\nartificial. One socket was empty. From the other blazed an orb, so badly\ntwisted out of shape by the scar from the wound that had destroyed the\nother, that it looked to be almost in the center of his forehead, giving\nhim a horrible, ogre-like appearance. There was nothing human about him.\nHe was an animal.\n\nBlack Peter’s den was crowded that night. Finding no open space at the\nbar, Dickinson made one for himself by shooting, in cold blood, a poor\nSwede whose place he coveted. Before the murmur of anger and\nastonishment had fairly started, he stepped across his victim’s\ntwitching body to the blood-bespattered bar and downed the liquor which\nthe latter had just poured out. His baleful eye gleamed from under his\nmop of hair, challenging the world to dispute his right. The Swede was a\nstranger in the camp, and the ferocious cruelty and simian-like\nappearance of the slayer was such as to make the average man think twice\nbefore taking up a dead man’s quarrel.\n\nWhere he had come from no one knew. Nor did his attitude towards the\nworld at large tend to encourage familiarity. By that one venomous deed\nhe became the bully of the camp. From then until his death he held his\nsway over the scum of the earth that had gathered there by sheer\ndevilishness and wanton cruelties. He was a thief, a crook, a gambler\nand a red handed killer—a beast—a thing of evil.\n\nThe only sense of decency he had was in the payment of his gambling\ndebts. He would murder a man in cold blood without a pang of remorse in\norder to filch from his pocket the money with which to pay a debt of\nhonor. His philosophy of life was as warped and crooked as his twisted\nsoul. And yet, we allowed him to live because we feared him.\n\nTake the affair with the gang from Devil’s Gulch. Originally, there had\nbeen six of them pitted against him, as a result of some mixup with one\nof the partners. By shooting straight, Dickinson whittled the number\ndown to three before they caught him at the edge of camp with a bullet\nthrough his leg and a horse that dropped dead in its tracks.\n\nHe had no friends. He expected no assistance. Those of us who were at\nleisure gathered around to enjoy the spectacle, and to see that the\nstrangers handled the affair in a strictly ethical manner. The only tree\nin that part of the state was a stunted cottonwood, the lower limbs of\nwhich were but a few feet above his head as he stood erect. His gun was\nempty and he was apparently exhausted.\n\nHence, they attempted to send him into the presence of his maker without\ngoing to the trouble of binding him, thinking, no doubt, that he would\ndie game and save them any unnecessary trouble. They were not as well\ninformed on the general cussedness of the man, however, as they should\nhave been—a fact which resulted disastrously for the visitors. For\nDickinson, instead of giving up the ghost without a fight, made a mighty\nleap and seized the lower limb with both hands, taking the strain off\nhis neck.\n\nDoc. Wright, drunker and more vitriolic than usual, was among the\nspectators. The dissipated old reprobate chuckled gleefully and hammered\nthe outlaw smartly over the knuckles with his cane.\n\n“Leggo that tree!” he yelled. “Why the hell can’t you die like a man?\nYou yellow dog! You’re trying to cheat me out of your head!”\n\nWith the speed of a panther, Dickinson hung by one hand, slipped the\nnoose over his head with the other, kicked one of his captors in the\nface as he hung there, and vanquished the other two in a fair fight,\nfists against gun. And, when he had completed the job, he humbly\napologized to Doc. Wright for not allowing them to hang him so that the\nbonesetter could claim his honest winnings.\n\n&amp;lt;h6 class=&quot;btt&quot;&amp;gt;Back to Top&amp;lt;/h6&amp;gt;\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nCreole May And The Priest\n\nTo cave men like Jim Dickinson, love comes but once—and in ways that are\npeculiar and dark. That he loved Creole May in his own fashion there is\nnot a doubt. And, like his aboriginal ancestors, he demonstrated his\naffection by beating the lady of his choice whenever opportunity\noffered. And she, recognizing, in the subtle way that women have, that\nhis display of brutality was only a cover for the flame of love that\nsmoldered in his heart, took her beatings, whimpering, but\nuncomplainingly, and, seeking an outlet for her feelings, lavished her\naffections on Michael.\n\nMichael was an ugly brute of a cat; black of fur and short of temper—in\nshort, a feline double of Dickinson. Dickinson hated him with a deep,\njealous hatred—hated him because Creole May loved him. With the\npeculiarity of a woman, she treated her lord with humbleness and\nhumility, fighting his battles and cooking his meals in a true wifely\nway—until he laid hands on the cat. That, she would not allow. And\nDickinson, loving the swarthy strumpet who shared his bed and board,\nfeared to vent his feelings on the animal, lest he drive the female\ncreature from his side.\n\nCheeta, the squaw, who was reputed to be a witch, had warned him against\nblack cats—warned him as she cursed him for the killing of her husband.\nDickinson sought to close her mouth by knocking her down. But she\nrefused to be silenced.\n\n“It’ll get ye, curse ye! It’ll get ye!” she howled, shaking her skinny\nfist at the one-eyed man. “A black cat’ll be the death of ye! A black\ncat’ll send ye to hell, and’ll spit at ye while ye’r roastin’! Damn ye!\nYe spawn of the devil!”\n\nIn self-defense, he was compelled to choke her into unconsciousness. But\nher screams still echoed in his ears. Nor could he drown them in drink.\nFor the maggots in his head were the kind that alcohol stimulates,\nrather than deadens.\n\nWe had our priest. Father O’Laughlin, a warm-hearted little chap who\nsought, with every means at his command, to regenerate the place and\nbring its inhabitants into the fold. He met with scant success to say\nthe most. But he persisted and, because he was a man among men, measured\nby men’s standards, he gained our respect and love, even though we\nrefused to follow the cross.\n\nIn some mysterious manner, Father O’Laughlin learned that Creole May had\nonce been baptized in his faith. Immediately, he set about seeking a way\nto win her back to the church. But she had slipped too far down the\nscale of righteousness and virtue. She gave no heed to the messages the\ngood padre sent her, time after time, begging her presence at the little\nchurch in the valley, with its cross of spotless white. Of two evils,\nshe had been taught to fear Jim Dickinson worse than the threat of hell.\nAnd Dickinson, his soul already forfeited to the devil and his head\nhonestly lost in a poker game, waiting only his death to be claimed,\nforbade her responding to the priest’s appeal. But, to the latter, she\nwas a brand to be plucked from the burning, and after several weeks had\nelapsed, he determined to visit her in person and appeal to her better\nnature. For Father O’Laughlin loved humanity and to him none had dropped\nso low that he could not be saved.\n\nOn the evening selected by Father O’Laughlin for his visit, Dickinson,\nwho was violently jealous, having been called away on some expedition\noutside the law, had taken precautions tending to keep any of May’s\nadmirers away from the cabin, by planting a bear trap in the dirt just\noutside the door. To this May submitted dumbly, and without bitterness.\nShe was a woman, and her philosophy taught her that a woman is the\nrightful prey of the man strong enough to take her. The method of taking\ndid not enter into her thoughts.\n\nThey lived in a tumbledown shack far up the mountainside and approached\nby a single, narrow path, nicked high in the cliff. For Dickinson was a\nbit of a strategist, and in building looked forward to a possible siege\nfollowing some new outrage.\n\nWhen she saw the little priest slowly puffing up the path, she realized\nfor the first time that something of evil might result from Dickinson’s\nefficient though brutal attempt to capture his rivals. She was willing\nto stand his abuse, but sight of the priest brought remembrances of her\nbetter days, and over her swept a sense of shame. She rebelled against\nthe man of God seeing her in her squalor and misery. There was no way to\nflee, for the path over which he was approaching was the only way from\nthe place. And that path would bring him directly into the jaws of the\ntrap.\n\nCreole May, for the first time in her long career of shame and sorrow,\nwas panic-stricken. There was but one door to the shack. To dodge out of\nit, even in the dusk of the swiftly falling twilight, would betray her\npresence to the visitor. Nor was there a bush or a rock in the vicinity,\nbehind which she could take refuge. Yet she could not remain. She was\nnot given to analyzing her sentiments. She had a vague feeling that she\nwas not fit to meet the man who represented in that wild territory the\nchurch of her innocent youth—not for the punishment he might bring—for\nshe knew that he brought only a message of love—but as an erring child\nfears the parent who governs by kindness. Physical pain she could\nendure. But she knew that Father O’Laughlin ruled his flock by love. And\nlove, except the love she lavished on Michael, was missing from her\nstrange life.\n\nSo, like a child caught in some mischievous prank, she peeped around the\ndoorway and watched the head of the priest just appearing over the\nlittle knoll. Her foot rested on the chain which, fastened to the bed\nand dragging across the floor, was attached to the bear trap. To leave\nthe snare in its present location meant injury to the priest. Even if\nthe jaws did not break his leg, Dickinson might return ere she could\nfree him. And Dickinson, in a jealous rage, cared nothing for God, man\nnor devil. He might even kill the good Father.\n\nIn spite of her fear of Dickinson’s vengeance over the removal of his\nsnare, the religion of her girlhood surged forward in her thoughts.\nFather O’Laughlin must be saved. To think was to act. Hastily grasping\nthe chain, she gave a mighty heave and pulled the trap out of the dirt\nand dragged it into the house.\n\nPulling down the blanket on the battered bed, she laid the trap on the\nmattress, and laid the covering over it again. Then, she dived hastily\nunder the bed, just as she heard the priest’s step outside the door.\n\nFather O’Laughlin, receiving no answer to his repeated rappings, turned\nsadly and wended his way back again down the mountain path.\n\nWith fear and trembling, Creole May listened to the padre’s retreating\nfootsteps. Then, as they died away in the distance, she arose and,\nseating herself in one of the two broken chairs the cabin afforded, she\ngave way to meditation and tears, sharing her troubles with black\nMichael, her only friend.\n\nDickinson, returning earlier than usual, found the cabin in darkness and\nMay in tears. The moon, shining brightly on the front of the shack,\nshowed him that the trap had been removed, ere he reached the spot.\n\nWith a bellow of rage, he leaped through the open doorway. He stood for\na second, his single, bloodshot eye accustoming itself to the darkness\nof the interior. Then, with a snarl, he turned upon the woman.\n\n“Where is he?” he demanded, shaking her as a terrier shakes a rat. “Damn\nyou, tell me! Where’s the man you had in here?”\n\nShe attempted to answer—to explain. He refused to listen. The words were\nchoked off in her throat by the pressure of his huge muscular fingers.\nThen, holding her at arm’s length with his left hand, he smashed blow\nafter blow into her face with his right until, tiring, he hurled her\ninto the corner, a dying, battered, unconscious heap.\n\nThe cat, true to its nature, spit angrily at the invader. Roaring like a\nmaddened bull, Dickinson aimed a kick at the animal. Michael, attempting\nto dodge out of the crazed man’s way, became tangled between his legs.\nIn the darkness, Dickinson stumbled and fell, sprawling, across the bed.\n\nHis huge head struck the trigger of the bear trap hidden beneath the\nblanket, squarely, and with the force of a battering ram. The jaws flew\ntogether with a snap, closing about the thick neck with a grip that had\nbeen made to hold a grizzly king.\n\nDickinson threshed about spasmodically for a second, his eye bulging out\nof its socket … . His finger worked convulsively … then, twitching\nslightly, he lay quiet.\n\nOn the foot of the bed Michael, his greenish-yellow eyes gleaming like\ntwin fires, humped his back and spit in accordance with the prophecy of\nCheeta, while Jim Dickinson’s worthless soul entered into Hell.\n\nTwo nights later I helped Doc. Wright claim the head he had won, and\nwhich Jim Dickinson was ready to pay.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

She was prepared to subjugate her personality to the stronger one of her husband.\n\nAt first she had been patently contemptuous of young Pollitt, and then, gradually, as he absorbed Vesey’s teaching and began to develop more character, she became interested in him.\n\n“I studied them for a fortnight,” said Dr. Smith, “and it appeared to me that Pollitt was a type of half-successful commercial traveller ambitious to give up doing things by halves. I also gathered that the Veseys had encouraged him to take part in some kind of dubious racket, though I had no idea, of course, that it was professional bomb-throwing.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Doable Explosion\n\nHaving told what he knew of the strange trio, Dr. Smith leaned forward and invited Hawke to tell him the rest of the story.\n\n“Not all these recent bomb explosions have been the work of the I.R.A.,” said Hawke. “Some of them have been the work of criminals in the pay of a hostile power interested in stopping our progress in defence work.\n\n“Mr. Herbert Rawson, the inventor of the Rawson Rangefinder, was obviously one of their chosen victims.\n\n“As you know, a bomb was placed in a basement room of his house at Marsdale. It exploded at half-past nine on Wednesday night and wrecked his laboratory, which was situated upstairs.\n\n“But it was another explosion that gave the affair its really queer aspect. It occurred near the back garden wall of an adjoining empty house some three-quarters of an hour before the explosion at Rawson S place, killing a man and a woman, afterwards identified as Maurice Pollitt and Mrs. Vesey.\n\n“A mongrel dog, of the terrier type, was found running about close to the scene of this fatality, and I believe you were one of the several patrons of that cafe who were able to identify the animal as Mrs. Vesey’s property.”\n\nDr. Smith nodded.\n\n“A nondescript little brute of the type of which women will make a fuss,” he said. “Her husband detested the creature, and gave it many a sly prod with his boot. Pollitt seemed to see in it an opportunity of getting in Mrs. Vesey’s good books, and he patted it and made a fuss of it, much as she did.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nInspector Gray’s Theory\n\nHawke considered this information thoughtfully for a moment. He had a regard for apparently trivial detail which his friends the police occasionally found irritating, but which had proved of the greatest value in the solution of many of his most famous cases.\n\n“H’m. That’s very interesting. It suggests a possibility different from that which my friend, Detective-Inspector Gray, is entertaining.”\n\n“And what, if I may ask, is his idea of it?”\n\n“That the Veseys and Pollitt had two bombs in their possession, and had a further call to make, after placing that one at Rawson’s house.”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“That the second bomb, which was in the possession of Pollitt, or Mrs. Vesey, exploded while they were keeping watch—while Vesey was actually planting the first bomb in Rawson’s house.”\n\n“Inspector Gray’s idea, of course, is that it exploded accidentally,” said Dr. Smith.\n\nHawke nodded.\n\n“Whilst the crowd was gathering round, of course, Vesey, who would have heard the explosion, would be leaving Rawson’s house, having planted his bomb. He would, one presumes, clear out of Marsdale as quickly as possible. I have undertaken to assist the police in tracing him.”\n\n“Any clues as to his possible whereabouts?”\n\n“No. Not yet. The three were living in London flats, and they frequently changed their address. They were careful not to carry any papers with them, and it is thought they did their business at different provincial centres from time to time.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Time-table Clue\n\nDetective-Inspector Gray called later, and informed Hawke a trifle wearily that he had been making inquiries at every restaurant and public-house in Mars- dale.\n\n“I’ve been inquiring if anybody saw two men, a woman and a dog on Wednesday evening. You’d think that a sufficiently unusual combination for one particular Wednesday evening in a small town, wouldn’t you? Well, the entire blessed populace of Marsdale seems to have resolved itself into cliques consisting of two men, a woman and a dog on this very special Wednesday evening.”\n\nHawke smiled and offered the disgruntled police officer a cigarette.\n\n“And you weren’t able to pick up any clues?”\n\n“There was one such group that called at ‘The Brown Bear’ at about half-past eight, and inquired for a timetable. They were strangers, and the landlord was able to agree to the description I gave him. But they dropped no hint of where they were meaning to go, and nobody at either the railway station or the bus depot is able to recall seeing anybody like Vesey leaving. It was a market day, and the town was a bit crowded.” Hawke had other work to dispose of, but half an hour after Gray’s departure he gave himself up to speculation about the affair, and after a few minutes’ thought and the study of a railway time-table he left the Hat and boarded a train to Marsdale.\n\nSome two hours later his assistant, Tommy Burke, received a phone message from him.\n\n“Risden, Tommy. Do you know it? That’s the name of the place where I am now. A small town, twenty miles beyond Marsdale. Come on down here, will you? Bring the Bentley. Something rather queer has happened. May prove significant.”\n\nTommy met his employer by arrangement, outside Risden Post Office, by the side of which was a car-park.\n\nHawke, who had been keeping an unobtrusive vigil on a public-house called “The Spread Eagle,” opposite, got in the car by Tommy’s side.\n\n“We’ll hang on here for a while,” he murmured.\n\n“What’s happened, sir? What’s doing in this place?”\n\nHawke repeated Gray’s information concerning the people who had borrowed the time-table.\n\n“It occurred to me that there might be a clue there,” he said, “because the print in those things is so small, and so difficult for the eye to follow, that mast people trace the figures with their fingernails.\n\n“The idea would have been brighter had the time-table been brand new, however, for this one was full of fingernail indentations.\n\n“Anyway, there was a finger-nail indentation under the line of outgoing trains from Marsdale ending under the time 9.20—ten minutes before the explosion at Rawson’s house. That was just about the one train the Veseys and Pollitt would be likely to aim at catching—so as to be well on their way by the time the explosion occurred.\n\n“I looked down the column for any marks which might indicate the destination, and there were three fingernail marks in that particular column. They were opposite Woodford, Bramley, and Risden; and I went to Woodford, and then Bramley. They were both small villages, and the ticket-collectors, who know everybody using the stations, had seen no one answering to the description of Vesey.\n\nIt then occurred to me to see if I. could make some use of that mongrel. The beast had had a plain collar with no name on it, and was in the care of the Marsdale police. 1 returned and persuaded the superintendent there to lend it to me, and came on to Risden with it.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Promising Bite!\n\nIt was certainly an idea, sir,” approved Tommy, “but the mongrel’s hardly in the bloodhound class, is it?”\n\n“Hardly,” said Hawke, “though it has some of the attributes of most classes. Anyhow, I brought it to Risden, and the first thing that happened as we were leaving Risden station was that it tried to bite the ticket-collector. ’ ’\n\n“And what did the ticket-collector say?”\n\n“He said: ‘Lumme! That blessed tripehound again.’”\n\nTommy grinned, and nodded appreciatively.\n\n“Ha! A useful bite that!”\n\n“I questioned the man, and he vaguely recalled the three people I described, though he chiefly remembered the dog, winch had tried to remove a piece of his trouser-leg.”\n\n“Well, it was a start. What happened then?”\n\n“I decided to let the animal go its own way, and it led me on a tiresome jaunt half round the town. Then it went into that public - house over there.\n\n“It trotted right across the bar, and went through closely-drawn curtains covering a doorway at the far end of the bar.\n\n“I was about to follow it when the barman stopped me, remarking that the inner room was private. I said nothing to him about the dog, and it was apparent that he had not noticed it. I was in there for about ten minutes, expecting that the dog would be chased out, but it wasn’t.\n\n“I then watched the place from outside,” went on Hawke, “and, presently, the dog was brought out by a man who had it on a lead. No, he wasn’t Vesey. He was a small, slim man. I followed him for a short distance, and then stopped him and said that the dog looked like one that had been lost by an acquaintance of mine.”\n\nTommy nodded eagerly.\n\n“What did he say to that?”\n\n“He claimed that it was his own, but he seemed uneasy all the time he was talking to me, and was mighty glad to get away. Of course, it may only have been a case of common theft on his part, but— Look!”\n\nHawke gripped Tommy’s arm, and, looking through the open doorway of the tavern, the youth could see a man of slight build talking to the barman. There was a dog by his side, and the man was gesticulating—pointing to the animal and to the curtains at the far end of the room, and then jerking his thumb over his shoulder.\n\n“That’s the fellow I was speaking about. It looks as though he’s inquiring who came in with the dog,” remarked Hawke.\n\n“Then it looks as though he’s in the business,” remarked Tommy.\n\n“If he is,” answered Hawke, “I imagine that he has already got in touch with Vesey, who may have sent him back to the pub to find out how the dog got there. He will naturally have concluded by now that the dog has been the means of putting the police on his track.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nTommy “Steps On It”\n\nA few minutes later the small man came out of the Spread Eagle and hurried down a lane by the side of it, carrying the dog under his arm. At the far end of the lane, which did not admit vehicular traffic, was a road.\n\nHawke slipped out of the car.\n\n“Mustn’t lose sight of him,” ho said. “Find a way round to that road and pick me up there.”\n\nThe turns proved to be tricky, and Tommy had to back out of a blind road before he finally found the way.\n\nWhen lie reached the other road he found Hawke waiting anxiously.\n\n“What’s delayed you?” he snapped, jumping in by Tommy’s side. “Head towards the main London road. A fellow who looked like Vesey joined the small man, and they got a saloon ear out of that little lock-up garage. They’re moving out—and going like the very dickens.”\n\n“Sorry, guv’nor; not my fault,” apologised Tommy. “Watch me step on it now, though!”\n\nThe Bentley left Risden at a speed which left the townsfolk staring, and when he was out on the main road Tommy increased speed until the tyre treads were giving out a high-pitched, screaming note.\n\nThe speedometer had passed the eighty mark for a second when Hawke touched Tommy’s arm.\n\n“That’s their bus. That blue saloon right ahead.”\n\n“It’s travelling all right,” answered Tommy, “but there’s no chance of its getting away from us.”\n\nHe eased up for a moment, but the blue saloon put on such pace that he had to accelerate again to keep it in sight.\n\n“Get up a little closer,” urged Hawke. “I fancy they’ve been testing us to see whether we’re on their track, and they’re likely to dodge away off the main road.”\n\nWhich course the fugitives adopted about live miles farther along; and, as soon as the saloon disappeared from view around a concealed turning, Tommy stepped heavily on the accelerator again.\n\nThe turning proved to be a narrow lane with overhanging hedgerows, and its tortuous character kept the other car from view for several minutes. Then, on topping the brow of a hill, Tommy suddenly applied the brakes and uttered a surprised exclamation.\n\nAt the foot of the hill ran a stream, spanned by a somewhat decrepit stone bridge. The saloon car had stopped on the farther side of this, and was drawn in to the side of the narrow road which wound away up over another rise beyond.\n\nTommy glanced at his employer, and it was evident that both had become acutely mindful of the desperate character of the people they were chasing.\n\n“Well, what is it, sir?” asked Tommy, drawing the Bentley almost to a standstill. “A showdown?”\n\n“A breakdown, perhaps. I wonder if they’ve taken to the fields. No. Look, there’s someone sitting at the wheel.”\n\nHe suddenly sat upright and gripped Tommy’s arm, and, following the direction of his intent gaze, the youth saw the other man scrambling up the bank on the other side of the stream, and clambering over the parapet of the bridge as though in a desperate hurry.\n\nHe was running at full speed towards the saloon when Tommy accelerated once more.\n\n“Stop!” exclaimed Hawke, and the Bentley pulled up with a screech of brakes.\n\nTommy understood the significance of the order as soon as it was uttered.\n\n“The bridge!” he gasped. “I suppose lie’s put an explosive under it. We shall lose ’em if we don’t get across, guv’nor. We’d hotter risk it.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nWhen Murder Misfired\n\nThe youth had scarcely finished speaking when lie found himself being bundled bodily out of the car.\n\n“Out you go,” growled Hawke, taking charge of the wheel. “The risk is all mine.”\n\nThe Bentley was more than three hundred yards from the bridge when, after depositing Tommy in the road, Hawke sent it shooting forward.\n\nHis chance lay in the fact of their having made extraordinarily good time in reaching the turning. The fugitives bad only had a narrow margin of time in which to act, and they had to allow a sufficient number of seconds to ensure their own safety.\n\nThe powerful car bounced crazily over the uneven road, and almost tipped into the hedge before roaring away on the last fifty-yard stretch.\n\nThe explosion seemed to take place when the Bentley was actually in the middle of the bridge, but such was its speed that its precise position remained a matter of uncertainty.\n\nIts effect on Hawke approximated to the shock of a nearby flash of lightning, and the earth seemed to rock so as to tip the vehicle on to its nearside wheels.\n\nAt the same time there was a loud bang, and the air became clouded with flying objects, ranging from nuts and bolts to portions of concrete posts and granite blocks, which had constituted the fabric of the bridge.\n\nThere was a rattling and drumming on the car, and the sound of shattering glass as the windscreen split into pieces.\n\nHawke received a dazing blow on the head and stinging cuts on the cheek and hands as flying fragments struck him.\n\nBy some miracle he, kept the car on the road and sent it whipping away up the hill.\n\nThe experience made him momentary callous, so that he was indifferent to such a minor matter as a collision.\n\nAt the top of the hill he caught up with the saloon, swerved, and jammed the smaller car against a low stone wall, buckling in its side and knocking the driver senseless.\n\nThe detective pitched half over the broken windscreen, recovered, and then jumped out of the car, prepared to engage in a struggle, for which, however, there was no need.\n\nThe driver was unconscious, and his passenger, who proved to be Vesey, was dazed from a blow- on the side of the head.\n\nThe dog, which was barking excitedly in the back of the saloon, appeared to have had yet another lucky escape from injury.\n\nBy the time Tommy arrived on the scene, having waded across the shallow stream, a villager had fetched a local police constable, to whom Hawke quickly explained matters.\n\nThe head of the organisation for which Vesey, his wife and Pollitt had been working was arrested the following day by officers of the Special Branch at Scotland Yard, and Vesey then told the story of the Marsdale business.\n\n“I’d seen what was going on between my wife and Pollitt,” he said, “and we were just about due for a bust- up. Anyway, to get on with the story. The three of us were sent to do that Rawson job, and after we’d reconnoitred I went to telephone to the boss to make sure there was no last-minute cancellation.\n\n“I’d left my wife and Pollitt waiting by that empty house when I went to telephone, and when I entered the grounds of Rawson’s house I was surprised to find Pollitt coming out, followed, a few yards in the rear, by the dog.\n\n“‘It’s all clear,’ Pollitt whispered. ‘I’ve just had a final look round.’\n\n“I then went round to the back and got in that basement window and placed the bomb where it would l&amp;gt;e most effective. Whilst I was doing so 1 hoard an explosion nearby. I rushed out, and, when 1 saw what had happened, 1 beat it for the station.\n\n“It dawned on me then that the dog had been carrying something in its mouth when it was following Pollitt out of the grounds, and 1 was able to recall that that something was oblong and brown. It was, in fact, one of our little high-explosive packets, though, being intent on the job in hand; I hadn’t connected it with that at the time.\n\n“You see the little plot which Pollitt and my wife had hatched? Pollitt had set that time-bomb at the last minute when he saw me approaching, and slipped it into the basement.\n\n“It was calculated to go off when I was there, thus killing two birds with one stone.\n\n“But Pollitt hadn’t noticed that the dog was on hand. I always thought that animal had a bit of the retriever in him.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

He was never nervous. The whole thing was planned\npretty neatly. The cops could prove that Jim Metton was within driving\ndistance of his aunt’s place tonight, but he’d out-fox them; he’d admit\nit before they tried to prove it.\n\nHe’d take the news pretty hard about the old lady getting knocked off.\nThen he’d tell them that he’d been on his way to pay his respects to\nher, and that he and Merrylee had stopped off at this tourist court for\nthe night.\n\nOh, he’d lay it on good. The wandering nephew arriving one day after his\nbeloved aunt was brutally murdered. He’d be quiet and dignified about\nit, but he’d do it good. Just like those friends of his aunt, he’d\nbe—distraught, broken up over the whole thing.\n\nAnd Merrylee would swear that he hadn’t left her bed. She’d be\nembarassed about it all, very embarassed when the cops asked her if she\nhad really stayed with him at the camp. Just modest enough she’d be, and\njust blushing enough and just sentimental enough in telling them they\nwere going to be married anyway. That it ought to make a pretty good\nalibi; the sweet young thing admitting her indiscretion to prove his\nalibi.\n\nThat’s why he liked Merrylee, he decided as he pulled the car in under\nthe trees along the quiet road. She could turn it on and off when she\nwanted to; she could see things his way.\n\nNone of this sentimental stuff his aunt was always pulling. This\nrigamarole of pleading with him to let her lend him enough money to\nstart up a business and settle down. Well, he had humored her; he had\ntaken several hundred bucks at a time to start a “business”.\n\nThe business had always gone broke. “Dishonest help,” as he had told her\none time.\n\nBut now he was after big stuff, with no obligations. He knew his aunt\nkept lots of dough handy, knew where she kept it; and to make sure she’d\nhave plenty on hand he had written saying he was coming on the seventh.\nWell, this was the sixth, and he was here.\n\nHe had made it clear, very clear, because his aunt was always getting\nthings like that mixed up. She was always giving him birthday presents\nahead of time, and sending people things on the wrong dates for\nanniversaries. She sure was bugs on that sentimental pap, parties, or\nbirthdays and all that.\n\nWell, this would be a party, all right, all right. This would be her\nlast one.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nSurprise! Surprise! Surprise!\n\nHe had walked the quiet road, and in the darkness turned into the drive\nhe knew so well. Far down the road he had left he saw the faint light\nfrom somewhere on the lustrous paint of parked cars.\n\nProbably somebody down at Metton’s was having a card-party, playing\npinochle or something. Holy Snake-eyes! Pinochle! Well, they were far\nenough away, he wouldn’t have to worry about anything but pure bad luck,\nand he had planned most of those things ahead.\n\nAnd he had planned just the way he’d do it, too. No fooling around. He’d\ngo up the steps as he was now, looking, as he ascended for any last\nminute thing that might change his plans; seeing, as he was seeing now,\nthat there was only a dim light in the room downstairs where she always\nsat to save electricity. She was probably knitting something for one of\nher friends, and she’d be sitting in the old chair with the high back.\nHe was pretty sure of that.\n\nHe was perfectly right, of course. She was sitting just there, scrunched\nup against the chair-back to get the best of the light from the dim\nbulb. Well, he wasn’t going to give her a chance to start any\nblabbering. She would hear him come in, as he was coming in now, but\nbefore she could get up, he would have the rope over her head. He would\nbe twisting the ends tight before she could get up and kiss him and cry\non his shoulder with that sentimental stuff.\n\nIt would better be swift. He let the door swing wide. He had the noose\ntight around her when the door hit the old cast-iron door-stop with a\nclang. That didn’t bother him, that noise, it would probably be the last\nthing she ever heard. That, and his foot-steps.\n\nHe pulled hard on the rope ends, saw the old, worn hands come up and\nclaw at the coarse fibres. A moment would do it with such an old and\nfeeble thing.\n\nThen the money. Then away and back to Merrylee. He was quite pleased\nwith himself. He felt no qualms, no sentimental twinges of remorse. He\nhad only to hold on a moment longer and then he’d have his hands on some\nreal dough.\n\nHe held on. The thin hands picked almost idly at the coarse fibre of the\nrope. Now, perhaps it was done! He’d hold on, though, best to make a\ngood job of it.\n\nAnd in that last moment that he felt was the perfection of making sure\nhe began to look toward the place he knew the money would be hidden.\nThat was why his head was turned away when the bright overhead lights\ncame on. That was why he didn’t see the gay onrushing group till they\nwere on top of him.\n\nBut he heard the shouts of “Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!”\n\nAnd he did turn his head in time to see the laughing faces of his aunt’s\nfriends in all their sentimental party gaiety. In fact, big Jim Melton’s\nface didn’t have time to change as his eye did, and Sally Carver’s\nscream wasn’t as fast as her husband’s fist.\n\nThe big fist travelled just slowly enough to let Jim realize that he\nhadn’t quite done the thing he had come to do, and just time enough to\ncurse all the soft and mushy people who gave surprise parties and then\ngot their dates mixed on top of that. He tried to scream something like\nthat, but his teeth were in his throat then, and there wasn’t time.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Bosco The Blimp\n  Sniggy Welp\n  Dinsmore Smooch\n  Humbert Prawn\n  Snooty Piper\n  Half Ton Tripeski\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nBosco The Blimp\n\nFor many moons, the Boston cops have wondered why Snooty Piper finds out about murders the same time they do. If you know the crackpot, there is nothing mysterious about it. It seems that Snooty has something on most newspaper reporters—little things like two-timing the little woman or playing poker when they should have been to a lodge. So it is not surprising to me that Snooty gets the news that a character named Bosco the Blimp gets knocked off hardly before the remains begin to cool.\n\nThe Blimp left quite a record behind him as he was mixed up in more rackets than a tennis player. The gendarmes suspected him of being engaged in the business of retailing hot auto tires only a few minutes before a rough person laid him away for keeps.\n\nWe are in the Greek’s when the word of the assassination reaches Snooty Piper. He rushes out of the phone booth and yelps that he knows where there is a murder. Ten minutes later, we are in an alley not far from the North Station, watching the appraiser of the violently departed brief the shell of Bosco the Blimp. Someone has bashed Bosco with something more than a swizzle stick. Rigor mortis is not far away.\n\n“It was nice of you to phone me,” Snooty says to a rather lumpy character.\n\n“Oh, yeah?” the citizen replies. “Someday something will happen to you, fish-face, even worst than what you see here.”\n\n“That I hope to see,” I snap. The irate one is a cop. He was on his way home and was taking a shortcut via an alley when he fell over the stiff. “If you throw the party and charge two bucks admission you will clean up five grand. Snooty is that popular.”\n\n“What goes on here?” a voice booms out. It is Iron Jaw O’Shaughnessy, who puts down he is a detective on questionnaires. We are all quite sure in Boston that Iron Jaw’s forebears, and not so far back, used to pick up peanuts with their trunks. One of his shoes would make a nice cowboy saddle, and you could easily get four quarts of fish chowder in his derby.\n\n“Nothing that should interest you,” Snooty says. “Somebody got killed and the murderer was absent-minded.”\n\n“It is you, hah?” Iron Jaw snaps. “How did you know he was?”\n\n“He forget to leave you a clue,” Snooty needles.\n\nIron Jaw whips off his derby and bangs Snooty just over the right eye.\n\n“You should keep your tongue in your head,” I says without much sympathy.\n\n“Then who would lick my stamps?” the halfwit counters. I ignore him and go back to looking at what is left of Bosco the Blimp. The cops do not find any pieces of crystal from a broken watch and no footprints. It looks like the killer-diller had planned the rubout with much mental toil.\n\n“Nothin’ to go on,” Iron Jaw gripes. “I wish for oncet I could have a murder like in the movies. Piper, have you spotted anythin’, huh? You tell me, or I will tear off your arm and wrap it around your tonsils.”\n\n“If I give you the murderer’s fingerprint, you would find that there was another character in the world with the same Bertillon smudges, you are that far back of the eight ball,” Snooty opines.\n\n“Leave him alone, Snooty,” I says. “You would torment a moose caught in a cranberry bog. I do not see as we can be of much help here. Bosco goes to the city icebox. The John Laws will promise an arrest within twenty-four hours, and Iron Jaw will pinch somebody who was eighty miles away at the time. This is like a movie where I came in.”\n\nEven Snooty Piper does not pick up a clue, so the M.D. orders Bosco to be filed away in the stiff warehouse.\n\n“Let’s go to the Greek’s,” Snooty says.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nSniggy Welp\n\nWhen we get to our favorite tavern and order two beers. Snooty shows me a slip of paper. “I been learn in’ sleight-of-hand out of a book, nights, Scoop,” he explains, blinking like an owl caught suddenly in a night-club spotlight.\n\n“I have been noticing of late,” I remark, “that you are having a little trouble with your glimmers, Snooty. You should see a mortician.”\n\n“I must admit the old peepers are not up to snuff,” Snooty says. “There are spots in front of them and not ten spots. Maybe I need tri-focals.”\n\n“It is from ogling every dame until she is out of sight,” I tell him.\n\n“I am a little scared,” he says. “I whistled to one last night, Scoop, and did not find out she was a grandma until I was orderin’ her a snort in a bistro near Tremont. I must see an optimist. But read what I gave you.”\n\nI do. It is a piece of paper torn out of a ruled notebook. It says Bosco the Blimp acknowledges payment for three dozen doughnuts. It looks quite fishy to me as whoever paid forty-seven fifty per for a dozen sinkers?\n\n“It is quite evident Rosco was mixed up in that hot tire business, Scoop,” Snooty says. “Wouldn’t it be a caution if we could break up that black market? We would also know who cleaned out the warehouse in Chelsea that night, which is more than the cops know at the moment. Some gee who was in with Bosco found out the rough boy was getting more than his cut, huh? Remind me to buy some eyewash tonight, Scoop.”\n\n“I would suggest you change the color of your clothes,” I sniff. “These awful bilious green suits are murdering your eyesight. They would give a hawk astigmatism.”\n\n“I’ll thank you to keep your opinions to yourself, Scoop Binney,” he says in quite a huff. “I know taste in clothes.”\n\n“You must always have the taste of limes in your mouth, then,” I says.\n\nWe are still in the Greek’s listening to a corny radio comic, when a fellow-traveler, who works on the Boston Morning Call, arrives. This legman says Iron Jaw has arrested a citizen known as Sniggy Welp for the unlawful extermination of Bosco the Blimp and has a witness to help send Sniggy off to the state rotisserie.\n\n“Well, you guys will have to admit the big slob had a break comin’,” the legman says, thanking us for a beer we didn’t order for him. “It seems O’Shaughnessy found this character, Dinsmore Smooch, sitting on the steps of the precinct house on Columbus not more than an hour ago. He tells the gland case that he was sleeping off a nifty hangover in that alley, when he wakes up and sees Sniggy conk Bosco with a tire iron. He gets a gander at the character just as he passes by a lighted window in the alley. He takes a look at the cadaver, gets scared and runs home. Then he comes back to tell the police.”\n\n“It is amazing detecting on the big beast’s part, isn’t it, Scoop?” Snooty snorts. “I have an idea Sniggy has pals. Iron Jaw better call out some veterans of Saipan and Okinawa to escort this Smooch person about the Hub.”\n\n“The D.A. knows about such things,” I sniff. “Let’s go to the clink and listen to the big mental deficit crow.”\n\nIron Jaw is in the back room passing out nickel cigars when we arrive. “Sure, boys,” O’Shaughnessy says. “You stick aroun’ this police work as long as me, an’ you’ll git so’s you can smell a murderer out in five minutes. Nothin’ but elemental is all an’—”\n\n“Congratulations,” Snooty says to the massive citizen. “It is a good thing we have stewpots in Boston, huh? Supposin’ Smooch had decided to lick the D. T.’s on the Common instead? If you ever arrested somebody by just usin’ your own brain, then the Nazis took Stalingrad and are putting dynamite under the Charles River Bridge.”\n\nWe find out that Bosco the Blimp was about to go straight when Sniggy removed him from the voting list.\n\nFor who comes in while we are there but a doll who looks more than vaguely familiar to us.\n\nSure enough, she identifies herself as Mamie Slognecker, alias Maggie the Claw. Mamie’s title as champion shoplifter of the Hub has never been challenged. There are cops that say Mamie once stole an electric icebox out of Graymond’s in broad daylight. She is very weepy over Boseo’s departure.\n\n“We was both goin’ to reform, yeah,” Mamie sniffles. “Bosco tol’ Sniggy an’ the other punks about it. Me an’ Bosco fell in love bad an’ was gittin’ ready to lam out an’ start legit in some other town. Anyways we was goin’ to give it a try. Jus’ let me git me hooks on that Sniggy. He’ll look like he spent a night in a eagle’s nest where the eagle just had young.\n\n“Cripes, jus’ when I wanted to git to be a honest dame. The only break I’ll ever git will be in my clavicle. Yeah, Bosco was in the tire-snitchin’ business, but he never told me who was in with him. Bosco was a honorable gee an’ had scruples. He said after we was married an’ was far away, he would give me the lowdown on the racket. I ain’t talkin’.”\n\n“An’ the Marines ain’t fightin’,” Snooty says. “Let me guess, Babe. Sniggy did not want Bosco to go legit, knowin’ as much as he did. He figured Bosco would whisper things in your ears, hah?’’\n\n“Who is this funny mug?” Mamie asks. “I never seen a worse thing while I was spiffed.”\n\n“Very funny,” Snooty says. “The cops had better furnish this Dinsmore Smooch with a Sherman tank and eight squad cars if we want to see justice done. Is there some boric acid in the joint? My eyes feel lake there was hives on them. Let’s go to a drug store, Scoop.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nDinsmore Smooch\n\nIt is all in the papers the next day about Iron Jaw producing a star witness for the state. Snooty is very nettled, and not just in the eyes. He washes his peepers out with some sort of pale green liquid he bought in a drugstore. It is a safe bet that if he ever wore a diamond, it would be green. I am very startled, to say the least, when he suddenly takes out a pair of cheaters and adjusts them. They are a dirty yellow color.\n\n“That does not make sense, any more than if I’d just seen a big bull lie down and purr at the sight of a suit of red flannels,” I says, aghast.\n\n“The optimist says it must be from my looking at green so much, Scoop. He says if my eyes ain’t cured to try an’ wear mustard-colored suits. I will die first.”\n\n“Let’s go down and see if we are still employed,” I suggest. “We work at the Evening Star, remember?”\n\n“I guess we must,” Snooty sighs. “You know, Scoop, if Dogface ever gave blood they used it to marinate herrings. Oh, I forgot to tell you. I stopped by at the office and learned that we was fired. Oh, boy, now we can go back to bed. It is lucky I remembered, huh?”\n\nThree days later, we run into Dinsmore Smooch making some purchases in Graymond’s. There is a very bulky plainclothes man with him. We recognize him as Gumshoe Gratz, a very solid citizen who makes a living convoying citizens who are needed by the law.\n\n“How does it feel to be famous, Mr. Smooch?” Snooty asks.\n\n“Scram, you goon,” Gratz snaps. “I ain’t Iettin’ even me own mother git within ten feet of this baby. He’s hot as a ten-cent pistol that nobody knew was loaded.”\n\n“Yep, I feel pretty important,” Smooch says, and bites the end off a cigar. “I might git out my memoirs after.”\n\n“Stick with Gratz,” I cuts in. “Or a memory won’t do you no good.”\n\n“Yep, boys, my bodyguard calls for me every mornin’ an’ I lock myself in when he leaves me at night an’—”\n\n“I don’t never leave him,” Gratz snaps. “I sleep right under his winder. That Sniggy ain’t goin’ to beat this rap.”\n\n“Well,” Snooty says, and that is all he says. There are two disagreeable sounds like slapping a leather glove against a riding boot. The derby on Gratz’s noggin spins around. Something whisks a cigarette right out of my kisser, just as if rationing was not bad enough.\n\nGrate starts shooting. Me and Snooty dive into the back of a moving van which is at the curb.\n\nAs we ride away, we see that Gumshoe is sitting on Dinsmore and emptying his Roscoe.\n\n‘‘Going places with you,” I snap at Snooty, “is very healthy, like bathing in a leper’s pool. If a shooting star should fall tonight, I hope you are two miles away from me. Let’s go into a subway where it is safe.”\n\nIt happens two days later. We get the tip-off that Dinsmore Smooch is in an empty lot in Natick, Mass., near a heap of defunct pre-war jalopies. Gumshoe Gratz is taken to the healing hacienda with a lump on his pate as big as Iron Jaw’s fist.\n\nWe hurry over to the mortuary where the mortal remains of Smooch will repose until the final rites.\n\nSome characters have put two lead slugs into Smooch’s vital organs. It looks very much as if Iron Jaw O’Shaughnessy has got to go back and prove things against Sniggy from scratch.\n\n“Everything happens to that big lout,” Snooty says. “I catch myself feeling so sorry for him at times. Shall we go over and console him?”\n\n“No thanks,” I says flatly. “I would rather go over to the Franklin Park Zoo and ask a keeper could I help feed the cobras this aft. Well, well, we have two assassinations and hardly a smidge of evidence. You are slippin’, Snooty. It is your peepers failing you.”\n\n“I’ll get back on the beam,” Snooty says.\n\nWe find out later how they got to Dinsmore Smooch. It seems that Sniggy has some very astute pals. They waylaid Gumshoe Gratz on his way to pick up Dinsmore. They slugged Gumshoe, took his clothes and draped them over a rough boy who looked a lot like the bodyguard. This gee picked up Dinsmore on schedule and took him for a ride.\n\n“You shouldn’t trust nobody nowadays,” Snooty says. “It is too bad Smooch was a little nearsighted or he might still be a mortal the same as you and me. Scoop. I hope these specks cure my trouble as anything could happen to me.”\n\nWell, it is like lightning striking in the same place twice, as what happens? There is also a witness to the rubout of Dinsmore Smooch. This citizen immediately gets in touch with the cops.\n\n“Yeah,” the witness says at headquarters with me and Snooty Piper taking notes. “I didn’t git a look at the baby who picked him up, but he was drivin’ a green sedan, the dirtiest lookin’ green I ever saw. I bet it was a hot car and was sprayed. No auto painter ever thought up such a color. I saw Smooch git in an’ then draw back like he wasn’t sure. The guy yanked him in and belted him over the pate. I run to help, but it was too late. I ain’t geared up to a six-cylinder job.”\n\n“Ahh nuts!” Iron Jaw says and slams down his derby so the windows rattle. “I have a conviction in my pocket, and that lemonhead, Gratz, loses the works. Is it no wonder I can’t git to amount to nothin’?”\n\n“You practice a lot on bein’ able to go nowhere,” Snooty says. Iron Jaw is about to paste the heckler when I intervene. “Don’t forget, Iron Jaw,” I admonish, “there is quite a stiff fine for belting a citizen with blinders on.”\n\nIron Jaw pulls his punch. Snooty is quite pleased. “I think I’ll wear them all the time,” he says.\n\n“Send out the alarm,” Iron Jaw trumpets. “Start the teletypes goin’. Call all gas stations an’ everythin’. Look for a green car—the worst lookin’ one anybody ever saw. Git busy, you dumb crumbs. Before the criminal sprays it over ag’in.”\n\n“There is no use of us botherin’, Scoop,” Snooty says. “If that car is of a peculiar shade of green, I’ll spot it quick when I see it.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nHumbert Prawn\n\nQuite early the next A.M., I am walking along Washington Street and pick up a copy of the Morning Post Mail. It carries a story on the third page, about five sticks, about an arrest made by Iron Jaw O’Shaughnessy.\n\nIron Jaw has picked up a green sedan on Commonwealth Avenue and plucked the driver from the same. Iron Jaw has locked the citizen up as a suspect in the Smooch rubout. I run to a drug store and call Snooty Piper. Twenty minutes elapse before I wake up the zany.\n\n“Look,” I says. “Git your rompers on. Iron Jaw has pinched a citizen named Humbert Prawn who admits knowing Smooch and having threatened the deceased in front of witnesses. It seems this Prawn found out Smooch was smooching with his wife while he was in the Army. Hurry, Snooty!”\n\n“Stay where you are. I’ll be right over!”\n\nThe crackpot hangs up before I can tell him where I am. I finally have to run to the Greek’s where he can really find me.\n\nWhen we meet, we decide to take a chance Iron Jaw has not heard we have been cut loose from the Evening Star. We crash headquarters and are told Iron Jaw has Prawn on the grill.\n\n“We will wait,” Snooty says. “I bet Iron Jaw will lose the most gravy in the argument. He has never made nobody confess yet.”\n\nIron Jaw emerges in due time. He looks like he has taken a shower without bothering to remove his clothes. He is saying things that stevedores would blush at.\n\n“That punk!” the big lunkhead snaps. “I’ll make his talk yet. Innercent, he says! He claims he was with his wife at breakfast when Smooch was snuffed. I called his ball and chain. She said he wasn’t and anyway a wife couldn’t testerfy against a husband an’ to go jump in a millpond. Why do they make laws to help criminals an’ murderers?”\n\n“Also detectives,” Snooty says. “You generally manage to put crime detection farther back than Adam. Look, the citizen threatened Smooch. He drove a green car, and he ain’t got an alibi. What more you want to go on? There was traces of gore in the murder buggy?”\n\n“Why—er—” Iron Jaw says. “I didn’t figure—I mean any smart criminal would think of that an’—I better look.”\n\n“Oh, Scoop,” Snooty sighs. “He is employed, while the likes of me is thawed out of a job that should be frozen in these times. Let’s sit here and wait. This is more fun.”\n\nSoon Iron Jaw comes running in.\n\n“I got bloodstains!” he yelps quite triumphantly. “Now, I got him. Let me at that smart Alex! I told him I’d fix his wagon!”\n\nAgain Iron Jaw emerges. He is chewing his derby. “He had a nose bleed,” he says. “Well, I’ll prick him, git some blood an’ prove it ain’t his. Does that always work?”\n\n“No,” Snooty says. “Suppose two citizens have the same blood type like Smooch and Prawn?”\n\n“That’s right,” Iron Jaw groans and bites off a thumbnail.\n\n“I wish scientific detective stories was real. Now, I am back where I started.”\n\n“Start swinging from your tail, then,” Snooty quips. “Scoop, I can’t stand no more of this.”\n\n“Neither can I,” I says doubtfully. “Weren’t you wrong about them blood types or were you? I would not put it past you to impede the course of justice just to spite Iron Jaw. I’ll look it up an’—”\n\n“If Iron Jaw arrested Prawn, Prawn didn’t do it. That is logic. But I must rush and see my optimist, Scoop. I think my cheaters are doin’ the trick all right. I wish I could git a lead on one or more of these slayings.\n\n“All we know is Bosco was selling black market latex at quite a profit, a very disgraceful practice that Mr. Guppy would give his upper plate to know about.”\n\n“It is our only way to get employed again, Scoop, to apprise him of the facts in the case.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nSnooty Piper\n\nIt is a rare feeling walking along the streets of Boston later with Snooty and not having somebody throw a shiv or a bullet where it will do a body the most good.\n\n“Peaceful, ain’t it, Snooty?” I remarks casually as we saunter down Huntington Ave. “Hear the birds sing, and see the babes wheeling the little squirts for a breath of air. It is good to be alive, huh?”\n\n“Scoop! Look!” Snooty grabs me by the arm and points. I see only a jalopy pulling away from in front of a hotel. It is a very ducky shade of blue bordering on violet.\n\n“So what?” I query. “I have heard that a few heaps are still in running order despite the war an’ — what ails you?”\n\n“Come on, Scoop!”\n\nBefore I can stop the crackpot and have a chance to make up my own mind, he is legging it for a coupé that stands in front of a nifty beanery. I jump inside the jalopy.\n\nSnooty yelps, “What a break, Scoop! The owner left the keys in it. I’ll drive.”\n\n“Look, flathead, this is not your car. I will not sit here an’ let you commit — ”\n\n“What did you say, Scoop?” Snooty yips as we turn a corner with shoes squealing like banshees with impacted wisdom teeth. “Somethin’ about not sit-tin’ there? You are at liberty to leave anytime you—”\n\n“I can change my mind, huh?” I screech. “What are you chasin’ that boiler for? It is not green!”\n\n“What ails your eyes?” Snooty counters. “Of course, it is green!”\n\n“It is blue,” I yelp.\n\n“You are bein’ silly as usual,” Snooty tosses at me, then manages to miss a beverage truck only by the width of a drug store sandwich. “I wish people wouldn’t hog the road, Scoop. There is no pep in this jalopy. It runs like—”\n\n“Only seventy-two you are goin’,” I says. “You have stolen an auto, and are bustin’ speed records with it. If you dast to cross a state line which I know you will, the Feds will get you.”\n\n“You always was a pessimist, Scoop. I have a badge to prove I am enforcin’ the law. I commanded the car which happens to lots of citizens as ask one who owns one. I’m catchin’ up with that criminal car, Scoop!”\n\n“Listen to me, Snooty! It is a blue car! It might be driven by a minister or maybe by the mayor,” I howl. “What has got into you?”\n\n“Ask me where I got the badge, Scoop?” Snooty asks as he goes over the brow of a hill without letting the wheels touch for at least five hundred yards. “That crook must be burnin’ high oxtane. If he was innocent, would he be trying to get away?”\n\n“Iron Jaw will not find his badge when he gits home tonight,” I answer. “Now for the second question— Look out!”\n\n“I will not bother to take the curve,” Snooty says. “I will cut across this lawn.”\n\nHe sure does. We wash out a summer house, tear up a garden, and leave a fender and headlight near a big stone bird bath. We remove ten feet of very pretty privet hedge. When we are on a thoroughfare again, Snooty is very enthusiastic.\n\n“We gained half a block on the fiend, Scoop,” he howls, and removes a bit of a rose trellis from his collar.\n\n“It is a blue auto, you lemonhead!” I says. “I still can’t understand why—”\n\nBang! Zi-i-ing!\n\n“That was no tire blowout, or we’d be whistlin’ at an angel right now, Scoop. That hole in the windshield was not made by a moth. Who is wrong now? You should have your eyes examined. Look, we will sideswipe him and push him off the road.”\n\n“You wouldn’t. Snooty! No! Y-yeah, you would—oh, if I can just live through this, I guarantee you won’t—”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nHalf Ton Tripeski\n\nThere are more shots. A slug burns my right ear. Then we are abreast of the blue boiler. Snooty Piper swings the wheel to the right.\n\nI shut my eyes and think up what I will say to the bony character who has the ferrying concession on the Styx. There comes a terrible weird sound. Both jalopies lock horns and slide down an embankment into a swamp.\n\nBy a miracle nobody is hurt bad enough not to start a fight. I see a very compactly built gee throw a Betsy at Snooty, then climb out of the wreck armed with a very ugly looking tire iron. Snooty is up to his knees in water. His puppies are firmly set in gooey mud. Of course, I will not stand by and see him killed in cold blood, although the temptation to do so is quite overwhelming.\n\n“Help, Scoop! I am in quicksand!”\n\n“Give me time,’’ I says, my noggin spinning from quite an argument with the dashboard. “First, I must find a weapon.”\n\nI pick up a headlight and heave it, but miss. The rough boy climbs Snooty. He is quite a Judo expert and is making progress in breaking Snooty’s neck just as I tickle him in the shortribs. The ugly boy yelps and laughs like a hyena and begs me to stop. I make a mistake and do so, then the three of us are locked in mortal combat. When it is over, Snooty has a different coat on. The criminal person has his head in the swamp like an ostrich ducking a process server.\n\nI look at the wreck of the rough character’s car and yelp, “I must apologize, Snooty. It is a green car!”\n\n“You are delirious, Scoop. It is blue,” Snooty says. “What are you doin’ with my cheaters on?”\n\nIt is just what happened. “What do you know?” I remarked, and take them off. “Snooty, now the boiler is a blue one.”\n\n“Not now it ain’t, Scoop,” he says, getting his peepers back on. “Quick, ask me what day this is?”\n\n“I am quite puzzled,” I says. “Let’s pull the bum out of the mud before he suffocates. After, we’ll sit down an’ figure this one out.”\n\nWhen we get the rough boy to dry land and sit on him, Snooty suddenly snaps his fingers. “Scoop, I got it. It is amazing to say the least. Why, it wouldn’t happen ag’in in a million years. What color is made out of yellow and blue?”\n\n“Green,” I says, then stare at Snooty Piper. “Them dirty yellow glasses! You chase a blue car which looked green. Now, I have seen everythin’! What couldn’t happen to you, outside of giving birth to triplets, huh?”\n\n“Let’s take him in, Scoop.”\n\nAbout an hour later a native comes along in a car. We flag him. Snooty flashes a badge, says he is an F.B.I., and orders the character to drive us to Boston. Which he does. There we find out that the dishonest person is a gorilla and ex-con by the name of Half Ton Tripeski, a very bad boy from South Boston, who has more than a couple of times been suspected of having removed various individuals from circulation.\n\nHalf Ton is still wearing Gumshoe Grate’s duds. Of course, there is nothing left for him to do but take down his hair. He confesses all in the presence of the D.A., three assistant D.A.’s, Iron Jaw O’Shaughnessy, and many policemen.\n\n“Yeah,” Half Ton admits, “I knocked off Smooch. Sniggy bumped Bosco The Blimp as he had five hundred more tires stashed in the warehouse. Sniggy wasn’t takin’ no chances Bosco would soften up as a married man. I still don’t see how this funny lookin’ haddock-puss figured I’d sprayed the green car blue. Aw, please tell me, huh?”\n\n“Ask an optimist,” Snooty says.\n\nHalf Ton gives the crackpot fifty, as he says what good is a bankroll where he is going. Snooty explains. Iron Jaw O’Shaughnessy gets up and walks out like he has poured three quarts of Six Roses into his big fat stomach. Half Ton is mumbling like a hermit. The D.A. says he thinks he will lock up early and go on home as he feels a stroke coming on.\n\n“Let’s go to the Greek’s,” I sigh. “Then we will call at the Evening Star.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Hoarsely, terrifiedly he whispered:\n\n“I’ve killed her! I’ve killed her!”\n\n“You haven’t killed her,” retorted the bronze faced doctor, “but it won’t be healthy for you to run away. They’ll have you swingin’ from a Montana telegraph-pole by sunset.”\n\n“It was booze did it!” wept the thoroughly sobered, thoroughly miserable young man.\n\n“Booze! Where did you get booze? You’re posted in every saloon in the county.”\n\n“Art give it to me. Art said I’d kept away from it so long, it was all right for me to have one little drink. Then I had to have another.”\n\n“He let you have them?”\n\n“He let me have them! I went mad. I came home. I broke down the door. I struck her—”\n\nThe old doctor paused in his desperate work of keeping the pathetically damaged little wife in a world which had proved very dreary, very hard, very disappointing.\n\n“Instead of running from this,” advised the doctor, “steer your pony for Sago City and see Lawyer Sanders. He can help you because he can sympathize. He came out here five years ago, a drunken sot. Where you were weak, he was strong. He cured himself. For five years Art has sworn to ‘get’ him. Not enough of Sanders’ family fortune has been dribbling into Art’s till. This is a case at law. Go quick before it is lynch law. Meanwhile I’ll do what I can for the wife!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nArt’s Business\n\nUp and down the floor of a very modem lawyer’s office in a very modem Montana, the handsome Henry Sanders strode with a chiseled frown.\n\n“Did any one see Art give you this drink?”\n\n“I guess not,” the boy replied.\n\n“Thought so.” grunted Sanders. “That’s Art’s business—pulling down men who are trying to straighten up and be rid of the stuff.”\n\n“I’ve tried to straighten up,” wailed the boy. “I’ve tried and I’ve tried.”\n\nSanders forbore to lecture. Having been in Jimmy Baggs’ place he knew that lecturing did no good. Instead, he took from his hip a beautiful gun. He crossed over and sat on the edge of the plateau desk.\n\n“See this gun?” he asked. “It’s the most wonderful gun in the world, boy. Why? It cured me of drink. Once back East I took too much. My friends called me the Human Sponge—not because I absorbed such quantities of the stuff, but because I submerged myself in it. They had to tear me off the bottom with a hook. I’m not joking, son. I was in a bad way.\n\n“Finally I nearly killed a man. I had to disappear. My folks sent me West. Coming out I thought the thing over. I wanted something to take my mind off booze. I got it. On the train was a man who told me about the old days of the West. His tales put some ambition into me. I would be the best shot in Montana. I bought this gun.\n\n“When I felt the longing for a spree coming on I rode over the foot-hills and practised shooting with this gun. It took me out in the open—away from the chance to get the stuff—for shooting in town is popular no more in the sagebrush country. The thing was: it took my mind off booze and put it on something else till the fever passed. So I cured myself from the inside, instead of hearing lectures on Francis Willard. That’s the way every man must cure himself, Jimmy—from the inside.”\n\nSanders fondled the gun.\n\n“I know you’re the best shot in Montana,” acknowledged the lad.\n\n“When I’d controlled myself, I took up law, built up this practice. But Art still swears the day will come when he’ll get me. Drink drives me mad the same as it does you, Jimmy, so I’ll take your case because indirectly, it’s my own.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Walloper of a Gun-Fight\n\nAt twenty minutes past eleven of the same Montana forenoon, a hatless, breathless, whitefaced youth banged into the office of Sheriff Cole. He cried:\n\n“All hell’s broke loose down to Art’s! There’s a gun-fight on and it’s a walloper!”\n\nA dull, sullen roar came on the droning sunshine, punctuated by three sharp cracks. For the first time the grizzled old sheriff noted the street without, deserted.\n\n“All Sago’s down there. That roar is the crowd, excited!”\n\nThe sheriff lifted two ugly revolvers from a drawer of his desk. They were the guns of the Western yesteryear. It had been a long time since their wicked muzzles were aimed at men.\n\nThe side street connecting Main with the depot was sardined with humanity. Through it plowed the man of law, profanity and devastation behind him.\n\nMidway of this street some one in the crowd shouted and the words struck the kindly old sheriff harder than a knotted fist crashed against his forehead:\n\n“Art’s got Sanders!”\n\nFrom the open square at the end of the street, across the tracks to the one-storied saloon, was a bullet-swept area of destruction where a sizzling noon sun beat down.\n\nThe plate-glass front of this saloon had been shattered. Out of the low-studded door drifted smoke of exploded cartridges. Even as the sheriff paused, a man staggered out, clutched at the doorcasing and fell on his face. Two more shots banged in the dark interior. Came a long, agonized cry, a plea for mercy, the tinkle of glass, another shot, the whole trailing off into inarticulate blubber.\n\n“Sanders went to see Art about a case at law,” cried a breathless barber. “One of my men was gettin’ a drink and saw the whole thing. Art doped the soft drinks, little at a time. Sanders tumbled off the wagon without knowing it. Thought he was fixin’ up the matter all sociable with Art and every drink was makin’ him worse. Art got a good stiff whisky down him and the man’s gone mad. He’s shootin’ Art into little pieces!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Law of Montana\n\nSago City was in an uproar. Stores had been locked. Proprietors had bolted for the depot. A mob surged dangerously near the limit of the buildings’ protection. Above the bedlam came the steady paragraphing of shots from the depths of the depot saloon.\n\nOne of these hit an arc lamp. The globe crashed in a thousand slivers on the asphalt. Another struck the window in a block on the far side the square and bored within to do what damage might later be discovered.\n\nSomething like a sob escaped the sheriff. He knew the heroic fight that Sanders had made to keep clear of the hellish saloon-man’s machinations. There was but one redeeming feature. Art might have made good his threat. But within those dark depths was being enacted a frightful retribution.\n\nWith a juggernaut of emotion, the old sheriff saw and understood. But there was his duty. The glint of the old fighting West leaped in his eye. He faced the danger of the situation with the battle-light on his features that will ever enshrine the land of the copper sage in song and story.\n\nAs he made the depot tracks in safety and headed for the door, an ashen-faced young man stumbled out. One arm hung useless. The hand of the other was held up tragically to keep the sheriff away.\n\n“You ain’t goin’ in!” declared Jimmy Baggs in a terrible whisper.\n\n“I’m an officer of the law,” swore the sheriff. “I’m in office to stop murder—and I’ll do it!”\n\nOne look at Jimmy Baggs told the sheriff the boy was hysterical.\n\n“Of the law of Montana,” mouthed the boy, “but not of the retribution bein’ carried out in there. Art fed him ‘fixed’ drinks—same as he fed me—and he’s brought his punishment on himself. Let him suffer!”\n\nThe sheriff paused, thinking dynamically.\n\nThe spectator who had been in the saloon when the shooting started, who had been hit and stumbled from the building, had drawn a gun in his flight. Dragging a damaged limb as he pulled himself out of danger, he left the weapon behind him on the sidewalk cinders. The boy saw it. In an instant it was in his twitching fingers.\n\nAs the sheriff debated, the boy aimed the gun. Only the sheriffs guardian angel held Jimmy’s finger from tightening on the trigger.\n\n“You’re not goin’ in!” the boy declared in a white whisper.\n\n“Anybody else in there but Sanders and Art?”\n\n“No.”\n\nThe sheriff turned abruptly and walked back across the tracks.\n\nIt was not because he feared the gun the youngster aimed in his hand.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nPoor Sanders\n\nThe crowd saw a strange thing. Sheriff King Cole, bravest man left from a West which has gone, deliberately turned and struck a Sago City police officer who had summoned courage to charge where he saw the sheriff leading. Maybe it was a remark the officer made as he saw the sheriff returning.\n\nBut before explanations were in order, a white-clothed, bloody figure stumbled from the fatal door.\n\nBefore he could gain the safety of the comer, another flash belched in the dimness. A leg doubled under the punished barkeeper. He lurched and fell against the boy. The sheriff started back.\n\n“Save me!” pleaded the man, his features purple with pain and terror.\n\n“I will not!” retorted the sheriff. “He was pullin’ himself from the gutter and you deliberately kicked him back in for his money!”\n\n“I’m goin’ to die!” moaned the liquor man in agony.\n\n“You won’t die,” snarled the sheriff. “You’re too dirty to die! Poor Sanders!”\n\nSanders had appeared at the door. The panic-stricken crowd left coverts and fled in terror at sight of him. He was reloading the big weapon with pink cylinders of destruction. He turned it, brought it to his hip, tightened on the trigger. The scarlet semaphore fell with a crash.\n\n“I’m besh shot in Montana!” he sang. “Dirty shkunk—where ish he? Sherved poshted—Jimmy drinks!”\n\nCame a blubber of abject terror from the man at the sheriff s feet.\n\n“Oh, there you ish!” Sanders declared. “Wash me kill you!”\n\nThen, paradoxical to relate, it was none other than Jimmy Baggs who shrieked:\n\n“Gad—you mustn’t! It’s murder!” And Jimmy Baggs threw himself upon the wounded and helpless barkeeper’s assailant.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nSander’s Gun\n\nAs a wonderful twilight descended on the Montana foothills that evening, Jimmy Baggs was sobbing by the bed of his living wife. In many pauses he told her the story.\n\nHe ended the tale by drawing forth Sanders’ gun.\n\n“He gave it to me. He said he liked the spirit I showed in keepin’ him from perhaps killin’ the barkeep. He was our worst enemy, Art was! But, oh Mayme, I simply couldn’t see him shoot at a man that was down!”\n\nThey were alone in the room. The boy was on his knees.\n\n“He gave it to me and told me to use it as he had done—to cure myself. When the fever for drink comes on I’m goin’ over the foot-hills, far away, and do revolver practise till the hunger’s worn off.”\n\n“Would poor Mr. Sanders really have shot the barkeeper?” asked the frail and broken woman, toying with the boy’s hair.\n\n“Mayme,” he whispered, “swear by all that’s holy you’ll never tell. He shot the legs off Art in punishment. He wouldn’t have gone further, anyhow. He dumped all those doped drinks in the sawdust. The spree was to blind Sago City from punishing him for takin’ the law into his own hands. There wasn’t any other law to ‘get’ Art for draggin’ weak fellers down. The minute I stopped him from what I thought was goin’ to be Art’s murder, I saw it was all a brilliant piece of actin’—for you and me and the little stranger that’s comin’!”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n\n“You lie!” The words were snapped out like the spiteful crack of a\nrevolver by Captain McCarthy, whose great hulking form towered over the\ncowering figure of Wellington van Sandt.\n\n“You murdered your father!” shouted McCarthy, as his eyes, with a\nbaleful glare, held the red-rimmed orbs of the younger man.\n\nAside from a white shaft of light that played on the features of the\nyouth thus accused of murder, the room was in semidarkness. McCarthy was\nresorting to that timeworn instrument of torture of the police, known as\n“the third degree.”\n\n“You murdered your father, I tell you!“ yelled McCarthy.\n\n“I didn’t,” replied young Van Sandt. His eyes were bloodshot, and in\nthem there was the hunted look of a creature in fear of death.\n\n“You lie; you did! Here’s the gun with which you finished the old man!”\nAnd McCarthy shoved the revolver, with which he declared the crime had\nbeen committed, before Van Sandt’s eyes. “Your finger prints are on its\nwooden butt. It has been identified as your gun.”\n\nA shudder of agony convulsed the figure of the young man. His weak chin\ntrembled, and his lips sagged at the comers. The muscles of his face\ntwisted and contorted into a grimace of abject fear. Tears welled up in\nhis eyes. Would this torture never end?\n\n“I didn’t murder my father,” whined Van Sandt. “The gun was stolen from\nmy room by the murderer. I hadn’t—”\n\nThere was a resounding crack, of the impact of flesh against flesh, as\nthe heavy open band of McCarthy fell full on the white cheek of the\nalleged murderer. Van Sandt’s head went back with a jolt.\n\n“You’ve told me that before. You know you are lying. You’ve done nothing\nbut lie ever since you have been in this room. You’re guilty of the\nmurder of your father”’\n\n“Oh. Lord, stop it, will you!” pleaded Van Sandt, with tears in his\neyes. “Stop it! I tell you I didn’t kill my father. The gun was stolen\nfrom my room by the man who murdered dad. I tell you.”\n\nGrasping the young man by either shoulder, McCarthy jerked him to his\nfeet. Then, much like a terrier shakes a rat, he shook his prisoner.\n\nFor a moment he gazed into the eyes of Van Sandt. Many criminals had\nquailed before that terrible glint which now shone in the eyes of the\npoliceman. No one had ever been able to withstand those cold, cruel,\nsteel-gray eyes, which looked through, rather than at the person upon\nwhom they were fixed.\n\nWith a final shake, McCarthy threw the accused man in his chair and\nfollowed with a blow in the face.\n\nMcCarthy straightened up; a grim smile of conquest playing about the\ncorners of his cruel mouth, for his prisoner was thoroughly cowed and\nwould tell all.\n\n“Cut!” shouted the director, and the cameraman at the Great Western\nStudio ceased to turn the crank.\n\n“That was great, boys.” said the director jubilantly “It ought to get\nover big on the screen.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

I followed her through the rain from the Greyhound Bus Terminal.\n\nI could go for a girl like that. She was a come-hither blonde. She was carrying a quarter-million dollars’ worth of stolen rubies. And every cop in twelve states was looking for her for murder.\n\nI didn’t mind walking in the rain. I was wearing my old waterproof coat and GI brogues. I had to walk fast to stay behind her. But she had to stop running at the next street crossing to wait for the traffic light to change.\n\nI came up beside her and put my arm through hers. I could feel a startled vibration electrify her.\n\nI said politely, “Need someone to carry your bag?”\n\n“No—thank you!” she said in the hard, icy kind of way that’s supposed to freeze a masher.\n\nShe yanked her arm away. But I had my defrost unit working. When she started across the avenue without waiting any longer, dodging traffic, I followed and took her arm again.\n\nShe turned her head to glare at me from under the dripping brim of her felt hat. She had almond-shaped jade-green eyes, cheeks sunken just enough to torment a man, and a full-lipped burgundy mouth that was at present trying to scold instead of look scared.\n\n“Is this supposed to be a pickup?”\n\n“Do I look like the kind of man who tries to pick up beautiful blondes?”\n\n“Yes!”\n\n“Would you prefer this to be a pinch—Gertie Sale?”\n\n“Why—?” I knew her name. She was puzzled. “Who are you?”\n\nI had to drag her on the sidewalk as a car, turning the corner, washed past. “I’m Hod Danto,” I said. “I’m your contact man.”\n\n“You look like you’ve made some hard contacts.”\n\n“I’ve been bashed around—mostly by the police.”\n\n“You rouse my sympathy.” There wasn’t a shred of sympathy in her voice.\n\n“We’ll talk inside. My place is only a couple of blocks away. Do you mind walking?”\n\n“I do mind. But what can I do about it?”\n\nI’ve never bragged about my dump in the West Thirties and I’m not going to begin now. When I unlocked the door in the sunken vestibule I said, “Third floor.”\n\nI let her go up the stairs ahead of me. I watched her legs. Her nylons were all wet around the ankles and rain-blotched at the calves, but they were still the nicest legs I’d seen in a long time.\n\nI used the same key again to open my own door. I snapped the light on in the big single room that has a small slot of a kitchen and an even smaller slot of a bathroom.\n\n“This is where I live.”\n\n“And what’s your racket?” she said.\n\n“Private detective.”\n\n“Big agency?” She moved in and I closed the door.\n\n“No. I’m a lone—if you’ll pardon the expression—wolf.”\n\nShe stood still. Her long blonde hair was beginning to unravel at the ends where the rain had struck it. Little drops dripped off the hem of her plastic raincoat onto my dime-thin imitation domestic rug.\n\nShe seemed to hold tighter to her handbag and suitcase.\n\nShe said, “Who thought of the idea of taking me to your place?”\n\n“I did. I was supposed to take you to a hotel. When I saw you getting off the bus I changed my mind.”\n\nHer eyes hit me with the impact of two stones. “So you were there! Why didn’t you give me a sign? When no one met me I got into a panic! I thought something had gone wrong!”\n\n“Put those things down,” I said. “Take off your hat and coat. I’ll mix you something.” I flung off my own waterproof as I went into the kitchen slot. “What do you drink?”\n\n“The kind of report that Kinsey gives you in a bottle,” she said brassily. I tried to picture her as Renny Jordahl’s private secretary, but at the moment I couldn’t.\n\nI said from the kitchen, “I knew you were scared. You didn’t exactly show it. But I’ve seen people in my business, and I can tell.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Czech\n\nI came back again with two whiskey-and-waters. By now she’d even taken off her shoes and stockings. She was the type who needed very little urging to make herself at home. Her nasturtium-shade suit was wrinkled.\n\nBut on her I could stand a mouth painted on crooked or lipstick on her teeth. She sat down, held the drink in her hand and rubbed her bare feet together to warm them by friction. “It’s good to relax. I haven’t had a moment’s peace for a week. Dodging all the time. I feel absolutely safe with you.”\n\n“That’s my trouble with women. They feel too safe with me.”ß\n\nShe said, “Renny won’t think this is nice, your changing his plans by taking me here.”\n\nI took one sip and put down my glass. “Who cares about Renny as long as we think it’s nice?” I was looking at her feet. She had small round toes with scarlet nails. “Let me do that.” I rubbed her feet with my hands.\n\n“I haven’t got much to say about any of it,” said Gertie in a low voice. “I only work for Renny Jordahl.”\n\n“You worked with him!” I mashed her toes harder than she liked and she tried to pull one foot back.\n\n“You were going to marry him—until all this happened. Want me to go over it once lightly, dossier-fashion?”\n\nShe tilted her glass back toward her lips and swallowed. “You do a rough massage job. That’s all I know about you.”\n\n“Renny Jordahl called me up and told me all about it. Jordahl, with the big Fifth Avenue jeweler’s front to cover up his crooked business.\n\n“He had to phone me from a pay-booth because the cops are watching him. They even have his private wires tapped. But there are ways of getting messages through. Just like the way you communicated with him while you were on the lam. It’s tough but possible.\n\n“Jordahl told me that he’d heard you were coming back. He couldn’t meet you, because the cops’d nab both of you as soon as you’d met. You couldn’t go directly to him because of the same obvious reason. So I was the middleman.”\n\n“With ideas of your own,” she said.\n\n“You think you’re in a tough fix. That Czech—what’s his name?”\n\n“Jan Bardijov.”\n\n“That Czech was murdered for his pigeon’s blood rubies. Jordahl—and you—were practically the only people he knew in this country. Jordahl was dickering with him for the rubies.\n\n“After the Czech was found dead, you two were the first ones the police went for. Then you pulled a disappearing act, leaving a cute little note for the police saying you d taken the stones, shifting the whole blame onto your own frail shoulders.”\n\n“Clearing Jordahl,” she reminded me.\n\n“It didn’t work out exactly that way. The police’re still suspicious of him. They’re watching him, tailing him. But as long as you two are apart neither of you can do anything worthwhile with the rocks. You can’t dispose of them without Jordahl. And Jordahl can’t dispose of something he hasn’t got.”\n\nThere was an odd look in her eyes, but she didn’t say anything. I noticed that she held the glass with two hands.\n\nI said, “Brief me on the Czech who was murdered.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nHe’s Got Something On Me\n\nShe started slowly. “What do you want to know? Jan Bardijov got out of Czechoslovakia one jump ahead of the Communist grab. He was quite a smuggler. He got out with a sack of harlequin opals.”\n\n“Quite a smuggler,” I agreed. “Where’d the opals change into rubies?”\n\n“In Burma. Bardijov traveled east. Because opals are rarer in Burma than rubies, Bardijov managed to meet some potentate and make a swap—to his own advantage. He came on to the United States, smuggling in a quarter of a million in the best pigeon’s blood.”\n\n“Then he got in touch with Jordahl and Company,” I said, “expecting to make a sale. He didn’t know that it was worth his life.”\n\nGertie looked angry. “He asked a fantastic price. Jewelers don’t operate at a loss.”\n\n“So you and Jordahl did business as usual. You got the rubies at a hundred percent profit. There’s a slight hitch right now, but I’m in the middle to straighten that out. Let’s start by you giving me the rubies.”\n\n“I?” She almost dropped the glass. “I haven’t got them!”\n\nI had my chance to do some eyebrow lifting. Then I tried to cover up my sudden display of surprise with a little sneer. “It’s no secret, honey. Jordahl said he hasn’t got them. Twelve states know about you. Why be shy with me?”\n\nShe bumped down the glass. ‘‘But I haven’t got them. I ran to clear Renny. That’s the truth, Hod. Once the cops stopped hounding him, I’d join up with him again and we’d both leave the country. He has the rubies!”\n\nI stared at her, hard. I still had her feet in my hands, but I couldn’t feel them any more.\n\n“I’m glad,” I said. “The one who has the rubies is the one who murdered the Czech. I want you to be clean. But don’t play me for the little badminton bird, Gertie, shuttling me between you. You’re in no spot to try it. You’re in a tougher fix than ducking the cops.”\n\nHer eyes flashed. “What’re you talking about?”\n\n“Jordahl is planning to cross you like an X!”\n\n“What!”\n\n“Jordahl wants to wind up with the rubies and be in the clear. He’s going to pitch you to the cops for the murder.”\n\n“He can’t! I’ll talk—!”\n\n“You won’t be able to talk—not when you’re a corpse!”\n\nShe seemed to draw into herself and shrivel up until the skin of her face looked like lemon-peel. The way her whole body jerked made me hate myself for shocking her like that.\n\nHer teeth chattered.\n\n“You can’t mean it, Hod!” She was close to a breaking point. All her earlier indifference and toughness was a shell.\n\n“I was told to take you to that hotel room tonight and make you hand over the rubies. Once they were in Jordahl’s hands and he knew where he could get his hands on you, you’d be finished. You’d be found dead, as if you’d killed yourself, with maybe a couple of the rubies scattered around for added—”\n\n“Hod! You won’t help him do that to me!”\n\n“I was being forced into it. Jordahl’d described you and the flyers they’d sent to all the police stations described you. I thought I knew what you looked like. But none of them did you justice, Gertie. When I saw you get off the bus I started making plans of my own.”\n\nShe looked at me as if I’d suddenly grown twice as tall. “Renny must have an awful lot on you to make you do this. You don’t say anything about yourself.”\n\n“Yeah,” I said grudgingly, “he’s got something on me.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Old Kick-Back\n\nBut I was keeping it to myself. I wasn’t going to tell her that Jordahl knew me because I had links of my own with the jewelry business—on the shady side. I wasn’t what the police would call an absolutely scrupulous private operator.\n\nSeveral times I’d been retained by the rich Park Avenue crowd to recover vast amounts of stolen jewels. I had a good eye for pretty stones, in the first place, but what was more important I had some underworld connections. Also with insurance companies.\n\nI could take a fair guess who’d stolen what. Then, instead of an investigator, I’d become an intermediary. Seeing all the parties concerned, I’d work out a deal to sell the jewels back to the victims again at, say, about fifteen or twenty thousand. I’d pocket a nice corner of the dough. The victims would agree to forget about the robbery. It was the old kick-back.\n\nOn the phone, Jordahl had said to me, “I know the men you covered up in those jewel robberies, Danto. What would they think about you if the police got a list of their names?”\n\nI’d said, “The police’ll never hear about them, Jordahl. I spent six months in the clink not so long ago just for keeping my mouth shut.”\n\nHe’d said, “You’ll work this deal with me and Gertie Sale, or your mouth’ll be kept shut for a lot longer.”\n\nSo I’d met Gertie Sale. And now I was thinking of double-crossing Jordahl. The big single room was quiet. She was waiting for me to say something. I heard the rain hissing against the closed, scrim-curtained windows. It was a bad night.\n\nI said, sounding her, “Let’s quit fencing, honey. You’ve got the rubies. I’ve got a fence. I’ll get rid of them. Then it’ll be you and me, down in Buenos Aires.”\n\nHer lips twitched as if she were fighting to keep from laughing at me. “Are you crazy? You don’t think you could get away with something like that, do you?”\n\n“Let’s have them, honey. Don’t be stubborn. I’ll enjoy searching you, but you won’t.”\n\nThere wasn’t laughter in her now. Her eyes were cold flames. “I haven’t got the rubies!”\n\nI gently moved her bare feet to one side, got up. “I’m always a gentleman,” I said. “I’ll start with the luggage.” I bent down over the suitcase. She’d squirmed around, tearing open her pin-seal handbag and scrabbling a .38 automatic out of it. She poked it up. All she had to do was pull the trigger and I’d have a third eye.\n\nI felt all my viscera start to flutter. But I don’t think I showed it a bit on the outside. I said, “You’re not going to do any shooting, honey. You’re wanted for murder. How far do you think you could run in your bare feet? Or try shoving your feet into those wet shoes while the police’re busting up the stairs. Lay that gat down, honey.”\n\nI was close enough now to take it out of her hand. Her eyes were looking into mine and I couldn’t tell if hers were those of an angel or a devil. I reached out and took the gun out of her hand.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nWhat A Stupe\n\nShe closed her eyes as if ashamed at how weak she was and her arm dropped limply. I snapped back the automatic’s slide. A shiny copper-colored cartridge was bedded there in the barrel, winking brazenly up at me.\n\nI let the slide spring back and put the automatic in my pocket. “Search,” I said. “Will you do it or do you want me to do it?”\n\nShe dragged herself out of the chair and in her bare feet showed me what a stupe I was. She spilled everything out of her suitcase—and she didn’t care how personal the things were that I saw. She dumped the handbag.\n\nBut I didn’t see any rubies. She gave me a look of long-suffering woe. The shorn lamb look. I tried to cover up my confusion by being gruff. “Unless you’ve stashed them someplace, it’s Jordahl who has them.”\n\n“Just this once, believe a woman when she tells you something.”\n\n“All right, honey. I’m convinced. But that doesn’t get you off the spot. We can still go Argentine way, but we’ve got to get the rubies off Jordahl first.”\n\nShe pawed her hands into her hair. “After what you’ve told me about him, I never want to see him again. All I want to do is get away.”\n\n“I want to get away too. Only I’m not so callow as to go without that loot.”\n\n“But what can we do, Hod? We’ll never get them away from him.”\n\n“Isn’t it worth trying?” I said. “I know where Jordahl is tonight. If you showed up there suddenly without any warning he wouldn’t be able to do a thing to you. The cops’ll be too close to him. I won’t be far behind you. We’ll both work the rubies out of him.”\n\nShe sat down again with a tired flop. She picked up the highball glass and stared at it. The ice had melted and the liquid had been warmed by her hands. Then her blue-green eyes lifted to mine. “Do you really think we can?”\n\n“Sure,” I said.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nWhat’s The Matter, Sluefoot?\n\nRenny Jordahl was in his office on the twenty-first floor of the Harrow Tower on Fortieth Street. He was going to wait there most of the night, expecting a report from me.\n\nGertie and I stopped at the building entrance in the downpour. I hadn’t figured any definite approach to Jordahl. I was depending mostly on luck—and Gertie’s natural wiles.\n\nIn the lobby of black marble I could see two loafing men, the detectives keeping their vigil on Jordahl. We had to get past them first. I told Gertie to wait outside until I’d gone in and diverted their attention.\n\nThen she’d take a quick sneak through the lobby to the rear service elevator. She’d go up in that and I’d join her as soon as possible.\n\nI left her outside in the rain and casually pushed through the doors. The two dicks got interested in me right away. I recognized the one who elbowed away from the veined wall.\n\n“Where’re you going?” he said. He had a pockmarked phiz and a sadistic mouth.\n\nHe knew me. I had to act in character. “Up to the eighteenth floor,” I said. “The night watchman around? I don’t see him around.”\n\n“He’s down in the boiler room sleeping off his supper.” He peered closer at me. “Danto, ain’t it?”\n\n“And you’re Cougar.” We didn’t sound like two old playmates.\n\n“What do you want up for, Danto?”\n\n“My mother works there, scrubbing floors.”\n\nCougar sneered. “Are you going to hold the bucket while she wrings out her mop?”\n\nI was standing close to both of them. “I’d like to borrow a buck. Any law against it, skullbuster?”\n\n“You’re the type guy who’d let his mother work scrubbing floors,” said Cougar nastily.\n\n“And you’re the type guy,” I said, “whose looks’d be improved with a fat lip. I haven’t forgotten that weekend we spent, Cougar. You were the guy with the rubber hose. I felt it but it didn’t leave any marks on me.\n\n“You were the guy who suggested that I go without water while a tap dripped in the next room. You were the guy who thought it’d be more fun if I didn’t get any sleep for forty-eight hours.”\n\nHe niggled with one side of his cruel mouth. The other guy was watchful.\n\nCougar said, “I’ll make up for it by putting you to sleep any time, Danto.”\n\n“I don’t think you’re so much, sloose,” I said with studied contempt. “Nor your sidekick—Third-Degree Burns.”\n\nThe other guy straightened up. “My name’s O’Neil,” he said ominously.\n\nThe look I gave them did everything but spit on them. “Why don’t you two snouts go take a walk through the park and arrest some sparrows for trespassing on the grass?”\n\nI could see four fists. “Why, you punk!” snarled Cougar.\n\n“What’s the matter, sluefoot?” I said. My jaw felt as if it were bound up with piano-wire, but I forced the words out.\n\n“You’re two to one against me. Aren’t the odds big enough for you? Want to go home to put on your cleats?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nNo Hard Feelings\n\nCougar hit me. I tried to ride the punch and topple over backwards toward the emergency stairway. I rolled over into the dark at the foot of the stairs. Both of them came in after me.\n\nCougar’s partner, O’Neil, was wearing copper-toed bulldog shoes. And he was a kicker. Every time his metal toe went into my lower side I felt my intestines come up in my throat.\n\nI didn’t hit back too hard to injure their vanity. I didn’t want them to toss me in the tank. I let them work off their boyish energy. I kept telling myself over and over that this wasn’t much to pay for a quarter of a million bucks and Gertie Sale. It helped to ease the pain. Both of them were broken winded when they were through.\n\n“Get up!” panted O’Neil. “Hit the stairs!”\n\nI lay there. “What stopped you?” I groaned. “You haven’t fractured more than four ribs.”\n\nCougar hauled me up and I reeled sickly against the wall.\n\n“Still want to see your old lady?” he grinned harshly. “I’ll take you up.”\n\n“Frisk him,” said O’Neil. “Nobody goes up armed.”\n\nCougar went through my pockets.\n\n“Eyetalian rod,” he observed, digging it out. He lobbed it on the cigar counter. “You can have it back when you come down.”\n\nI didn’t dare leave the wall for fear I’d fall over. I slid along it to the first passenger elevator. Cougar came in behind me, slammed shut the gates, and almost blew a fuse monkeying with the control handle. He stopped on the eighteenth and I stumbled out.\n\n“No hard feelings,” he said, still grinning.\n\n“Not if it’s my turn to say that the next time we meet.”\n\nThe doors trundled shut and I crawled up the next three flights to the twenty-first.\n\nJordahl’s office door was closed, but unlocked. I wasn’t worried about getting things unlocked. Gertie had her keys and her knowledge of the whole outfit. No one was in the all-leather waiting room.\n\nI dragged quietly to the door of the private office. It was closed, too. I put my ear to the panel and listened. I couldn’t hear a thing inside. There should be voices, sounds of movement. How long was I getting up here? Jordahl might have killed her already!\n\nI turned the doorknob. It made only a cobweb of sound. I swung the door wider.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nWatery Graves\n\nGertie was at the open wall-safe. She was stuffing handfuls of currency into her handbag. I looked around. Where was Jordahl? No one else was in the office. The window was wide open and the grey monk’s-cloth drapes were billowing inward on the wind and they were speckled dark with the driving rain.\n\nShe turned and saw me and smiled. “Did they hurt you very much, my poor dear?” Before I could answer she went on, “How’re we going to get out?”\n\n“We won’t have any trouble getting out.” My breathing had a grating sound inside my chest. I guess I wasn’t kidding about the ribs. “Where’s Jordahl?”\n\n“There wasn’t much we had to say to each other. I stunned him with this.” She picked her automatic up from a bleached oak desk. She continued to smile.\n\n“He went out the window. I squandered two of the rubies on him to make it look as if he’d jumped.”\n\nHer eyes blazed up. “He was going to do that to me! Have you ever seen a man who’s fallen twenty stories?”\n\nI looked at her as if she were mad. As if both of us were mad. “You had the rubies!”\n\nShe snapped her handbag closed on the money. “I knew the safe’s combination. I cleaned it out so that we’d have enough to get to South America. After that, you can get rid of the stones, darling.”\n\n“We’re not going,” I said. I leaned in the doorway. She’d have to go through me to get out.\n\nThere was nothing aimless in the way her automatic was pointing. “I’ve got to have you, Hod! I need you to sell the stones! Come on! They’ve found his body by now! They’ll be coming up!” Her look softened as she expressed concern. “Did one of those men kick you in the head?”\n\n“I wanted to go with you, Gertie. That was when I thought you were clean.”\n\n“Hod! Please! We’ve got to get out!”\n\n“I can’t take murder,” I said.\n\nShe wasn’t a slow-thinking girl. She knew that finished it. “Get out of my way!” she said, glowering.\n\nI lurched toward her. “You won’t shoot, Gertie. I took that gat away from you once before tonight.”\n\n“You’re not going to take it away this time!” Her eyes were sea-blue. Like watery graves.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nRed As My Blood\n\nI started to reach out. She pulled the trigger. A sledge-hammer hit me in the right shoulder and I spun halfway around from the impact. I didn’t feel any pain. Just the punch.\n\nWhether she had aimed for a more vital spot and was so agitated that she spoiled it, or whether she had some perverse affection for me and was giving me a chance to live, I’ll never know.\n\nI was back in the doorway again, trying to recover my balance.\n\n“You won’t do any more shooting,” I gasped.\n\nI went forward again, walking as straight as I could. As I closed the distance between us she pumped the trigger frantically at my midsection, her face twisted and ugly. No more bullets came out of the gun.\n\nI grabbed her hand, trying to snatch the weapon away. She clung to it with furious strength and back-heeled me to the floor. Locked together, we fought like a couple of animals.\n\nI’ve seen some rotten rough-house fighting. She used every dirty trick I ever heard of to try to cripple me. I hit back as I would at another man. I wouldn’t let go of the automatic.\n\nBy this time I could feel the bullet in my shoulder, burning as if the devil had red-hot tongs clamped in it.\n\nHer tousled blonde hair was blinding me and in my mouth. Then she yanked back her head, listening. I heard it too. The rumble of the elevator door opening.\n\nShe leaped up and kicked me in the face with one of her high-heeled shoes. I rolled numbly half under the desk. But I had the automatic still gripped in my hand. When I lifted my head again and focused my bleary eyes on the door, Cougar was coming in.\n\n“What’s been going on here?” he snapped.\n\n“The blonde,” I said weakly. “You missed her. She must be running down the stairs. Twenty flights. It’s Gertie Sale.”\n\n“If she is, she won’t get through the lobby. O’Neil’s down there and a couple of cops.” He chuckled heartlessly at me. “What happened to you? You’re almost as bad a mess as the guy we found on the sidewalk.”\n\nI fumbled with the gun. “You can have Gertie Sale and the Czech’s rubies and be damned!”\n\nCougar had his own iron in his hand. “Drop that rod, Danto!”\n\nI didn’t drop it. I snapped the magazine spring—and that took all the strength I had—and pulled out the cartridge clip. I turned the clip over and spilled it toward the carpet.\n\nShe’d had only one cartridge in the barrel of that gun. The rubies poured out of the clip like red rain.\n\n“My compliments,” I said.\n\nThere was a fine mist spreading before my eyes. It was as red as the rubies. As red as her lips. As red as my blood.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  CHAPTER NAME\n  CHAPTER NAME\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nCHAPTER NAME\n\nWhen I first saw it move I became skeptical as to the worth of my\nvision. A dead man’s heart, cut from his body, sealed in a glass jar of\nalcohol—why should it move, how could it move? This heart was by far the\nmost horrible thing in Leon Campeau’s collection of human debris.\n\nAs his roommate and fellow student in medicine I had tolerated the clutter of\nbones and skulls he had picked up, also the immaculate skeleton which\nleered grotesquely at me from its tall, glass-doored case. But to me\nthis heart, this lump of muscle and tissue, seemed hardly appropriate as\na companionable ornament. Leon had brought it in that very morning,\ndelighted in its acquisition, for it was on the heart that he was\nspecializing. He had secured it, he explained, with the connivance of a\nkeeper of the morgue. He had bribed this keeper, he told me, to allow\nhim to remove the heart from the body of a derelict who was to be buried\nthat morning in the potter’s field. A clever fellow, Leon! The heart was\nnow where he had placed it—in its jar on the mantel—a reddish-brown lump\nthat seemed but a deep shadow against the vestal whiteness of wall that\nrose behind and above. With one elbow propped on my littered study\ntable, I watched the tiling nervously. Had it really moved, or was my\nimagination flighty?\n\nThere! It moved again—I was sure. Yes, it moved; an almost imperceptible\nflutter in its liquid preservative. I stared. It jerked again … again …\nthe jerks were weak, clumsy, measured.\n\nThe thing was coming to life; it was heating.\n\nI shuddered and glanced quickly behind me, all about the room. But I was\nalone—alone except for a dead man’s heart.\n\nLeon was away on one of his nightly amours, and Francois Bourlin, a\nfellow student who was specializing in diseases of the lungs, my own\nmajor, had spent the earlier part of the night with me. We had little of\nthe brilliance of Leon, who at a glance could grasp the meaning of an\nentire page and retain it, who could hear more with a stethoscope than\nwe could see with our eyes, whose skill with the knife had aroused\nadmiration from the greatest surgeons of the faculty. No, we were grubs.\nWe worked for what knowledge we got. But when we got it we did not boast\nof it as Leon boasted of his accomplishments.\n\nFrançoise had left at nine-thirty, and it was after ten when I noticed\nthe first movement from the heart.\n\nIts beats were now growing stronger. I could see the alcohol ripple in\ntiny waves with each rhythmic beat. I listened—and heard a gentle\nsplash, splash, splash, as regular yet not so metallic as the ticking of\na watch.\n\nSuddenly the heart flopped convulsively and drifted with the gentlest\nmovement to the top of the jar. It was beating steadily now. It circled\nslowly about the jar, like an exhausted bird not sure of its direction.\n\n“It’s impossible.” I muttered to myself. “It can’t be. It’s my nerves,\nmy mind. I’ve worked too hard. I must be careful.”\n\nBy a supreme effort I forced my eyes from the devilish thing. I rummaged\nwildly in my desk till I found my syringe, my bottle of morphine. I drew\nup my sleeve and among the many almost indistinguishable pits in my arm\nI pricked another.\n\nCalm came instantaneously. I laughed at my fruitful imagination.\n\n“It was my nerves,” I thought. “I will tell no one.”\n\nAnd, with freshened courage, I turned and gave a bold stare at the jar\non the mantel. The heart had stopped beating, was lying silent, inert,\nin its diaphanous grave.\n\nWhen Leon came hurrying in a half-hour later I was getting ready for\nbed. His sallow, carelessly-wrought features were splashed with the high\ncolor that is raised by much wine and aroused ardor.\n\n“Henri,” he cried, throwing aside his hat and ulster, “it has been a\nwonderful night! You should have had a girl and been with me, mon ami.”\n\nI was surfeited on this kind of talk every night. But I hid my shrug and\nasked:\n\n“And where was it—the wonderful time?”\n\n“At the Cafe Noir. Sacre, Fanchette is delightful! A wonderful\ncompanion! But you know her, mon Henri.”\n\nYes, I knew her—Fanchette—a mischievous imp of femininity. I had been\nwith Leon to the Cafe Noir, a modest tavern owned and managed by\nFanchette’s husband, M. Leblanc, a jolly little fellow so\namorous-hearted and so trustful of Fanchette that before his very eyes\nshe had carried on a flirtation with Leon. She was infatuated with\nhim—that I could see; and here of late he had become infatuated with\nher.\n\n“But,” I said to Leon, “what of the little girl back in Bayonne—Nina,\nthe girl who writes to you each day, the girl you are to marry? What of\nher? Have you written to her this week?”\n\nHe eyed me for a moment of hostility. “Certes, I have written to her.”\n\nBut I knew he lied; lying was a habit with him.\n\n“Quel diable!” he burst out angrily, after a moment. “Why do you ask me\nthat? How does it concern you? Am I an old owl like you, to sit around\nporing over books hour after hour, day after day? Non, non! I am no owl.\nI have life. I love. I enjoy myself. I am happy—till I see your gloomy\nface. Tiens, I provide for you, I give you room, I give you clothes; yet\nyou correct me!”\n\nI did not argue with him, for I knew that he was partly right: he was\nrich, I was poor.\n\nAnd, after all, his amours were none of my business.\n\nFrancois came to study with me the next night, for on the day following\na final examination yawned before us. We worked bard, nervously. And\nwhen Francois finally took his leave, my head was near bursting with\nthumpy aches.\n\nBut, obsequious to duty, I bent over my study table and began to review\nsome of Rollier’s pamphlets—wonderful treatises on heliotherapy and\nartificial pneumo-thorax. Outside, rain splashed down heavily, as if to\ncrush my night-blackened window panes. The cry of the storm was the\nmourning cry of wretched, lonely beasts. But I read on and on till the\nwords of Rollier became but dancing specks before my eyes.\n\nSuddenly, as if drawn by some subconscious power, I raised my head,\nturned slowly and stared—at the mantel.\n\nMy eyes found the heart in its tall glass jar, its reddish-brown shape\nsharply defined against the white background of wall.\n\nIt was beating more stanchly than on the night before, as if it had\nregained a lost vitality.\n\nAt the top of the jar the alcohol rocked and lowered in gentle wavelets\nwith each heartbeat.\n\nI listened—intently, fearfully. And above the dull beating of rain and\nthe whistle and howl of the wind, I at last managed to detect a sound of\nsplashing in the jar. The sound came steadily—a gentle, purring splash,\nsplash, splash—with each heart beat, with each wavelet.\n\nI tried to take my eyes away, but I could not: I was held by the thing’s\ndevilish charm. As I watched, the beats became thuds; the heart gave a\nclumsy jerk, then floated slowly to the top of the jar. For a moment it\nswam about uncertainly, from top to bottom, from one side to the other.\nThen its movements became rapid, agitated, violent. It dashed about\nfrenziedly, like a frightened bird vainly trying to escape from its\ncage. The jar rocked with the violent motion—I heard it, I saw.\n\nWith a jerky hand I wiped the cold sweat from my forehead.\n\n“My God!” I thought. “Am I going mad?”\n\nI tried to take my eyes away—and failed. I must do something! With all\nthe power of will and muscle I could summon I sent my right hand groping\nabout the table. At last my fingers found the syringe—and later the\nmagic bottle of morphine.\n\nSomehow I managed the injection. Calm came again. My eyes dropped from\nthe gruesome thing … . And when, in a spirit of bravado, I raised them\nagain a few moments later, it had stopped its beating and lay motionless\nat the bottom of the jar.\n\nI looked at my watch; it was 11:30. And fully a half-hour passed before\nLeon came home.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nCHAPTER NAME\n\nCHAPTER TITLE\n\nHe came stumbling hilariously into the study room, plainly drunk.\n\n“Tiens, mon Henri!” he cried, slapping me on the shoulder. “It was a\nhappy night! There was wine and my Fanchette and I—ah, what happiness!”\n\nAnd he babbled on foolishly till he had led me through the entire course\nof his happy night.\n\nWhile he was talking I was silent, but as he began clumsily to hang up\nhis clothes I could no longer restrain a warning comment.\n\n“One of these nights when you go to the Cafe Noir, mon Leon, M. Leblanc\nwill tire of your love-making to his wife. You had better watch out for\nhim. He is a man who loves much, and if he discovers your attentions he\nwill be dangerous.”\n\n“M. Leblanc?” Leon laughed drunkenly as he turned to hang up his hat. “I\ndo not fear Monsieur Leblanc. He is like you, mon ami; he is an owl; he\nsees nothing. Besides, he is away now. He has gone to the country for a\nfew days. He would buy a farm; he would put my Fanchette on a farm!\nPécaire! But while he is gone Fanchette and I are happy. She has hired a\nwaitress to take her place—a lean waitress with brick-colored hair.\nFanchette acts as manager, I am her assistant. Hah! It is amusing. But\nis it not an ideal arrangement?”\n\nMy silence seemed to anger him. As he watched me his leer changed to a\nglare, and finally he burst out:\n\n“But why do you tell me to be careful? You have corrected me again! How\nis it your affair? I will mind my own business and you shall mind yours\n… . You disgust me!”\n\nBut he was in a better humor the next morning, and when I came into the\nstudy room I found him staring rapturously into the glass jar on the\nmantel.\n\n“Come, man ami,” he exclaimed, “and admire with me the consummate skill\nwith which I removed this organ. Ah, was it not an artistic job? A\nwonderful specimen, mon Henri; just what I need for study. I will be a\ngreat surgeon, n’est ce pas? … You should have specialized in the heart,\nHenri, The old lungs that you study are of no use except for breathing,\nlike bellows such as blacksmiths use. But the heart—ah, it is the organ\nmagnifique! It is the heart that sends out blood that is like the\nrichest of wine. It is the heart that puts the glow to my Fanchette’s\ncheeks. It is the heart that gives us happiness, emotion, love. A\nwonderful thing, Henri—wonderful!”\n\nI failed miserably in my examinations that day, but from the triumphant\nexpression on Leon’s face when I met him early in the evening I knew\nthat he had succeeded as completely as I had failed. The situation was\ngalling to me: I had worked slavishly, he had trifled and loafed; yet I\nhad lost and he had won.\n\nAfter a hasty dinner at my pension, I hurried to my room. As usual, Leon\nwas gone. Partly because of a crushing headache and wracked nerves and\npartly because of a desire to be entirely alone in enduring the day’s\ndisappointments, I went to bed. But I did not sleep—I tossed and rolled;\nI thought, suffered, despaired.\n\nFinally I got up, jerked one of Leon’s richly-hued robes about me and\nwent into the study room. It was eleven o’clock.\n\nThe night was black—a desolation of disturbing quietude. The wind and\nrain of the night before had gone. Not a whisper, not a sound of any\nkind came to break the silence of the room—it was like a void, a\nvacuity, of the portentous stillness.\n\nSuddenly, yet inexorably, I was gripped by that same subconscious force\nthat had come to me the night before. It raised my head from my propping\nhands. It turned me in my chair. It focused my eyes on the tall glass\njar that sat on the mantel.\n\nSurely, regularly, its every motion accentuated against the pure white\nbackground of wall, the heart was beating, beating.\n\nA sudden anger rose within me.\n\n“I am going mad!” I thought desperately. I would seize the jar and its\ndevilish contents;\n\nI would smash it, hurl it from the window. But to carry out my\nresolution I could not summon the strength of a single muscle. I was\nhelpless.\n\nAs I watched, the reddish-brown lump began to swim about the jar. Its\nbeating was measured, like a funeral tramp. I could hear it, its\nsplashing sound thudding mightily in the deep stillness.\n\nSuddenly there came a tremendous splash. The heart dived to the bottom,\nfloundered for a moment, then again shot to the top. Its motion was so\nrapid that my eyes could scarcely follow it. It churned the liquid. It\ndashed and darted about, madly, frantically. It thrashed about in the\nalcohol like a wounded shark in the agony of death.\n\n“The thing has a soul,” I thought; “and it is troubled, disturbed.”\n\nThe jar rocked, almost overturned, from the violent movement within. The\nheart veered, dodged, banged upward, then shot down. Yes, the thing must\nhave a soul.\n\nI tried to take my eyes away—fruitless effort! The thing was possessing\nme, was my master. It bade me watch, and I did. But as I watched I think\nI must have prayed.\n\nI tried to reach for my syringe; but my hand hung motionless at my side.\nI was powerless.\n\nA quick thought almost calmed me.\n\n“I will see now—” I told myself—”I will see whether it is my nerves,\nwhether I am going mad, I will fight it without the morphine. I will\nfight it, and if it ceases moving, I will have won.”\n\nMy situation was no longer terrifying; it became a game, a battle. I was\nfighting, playing against the reddish-brown streak that thrashed\ncontinuously against its background of white; I was fighting its\nmonotonous beats, its zigzagging progress, its splashing sounds, the\nagitated wavelets it made.\n\nA mellow-toned clock boomed faintly in the distance. I counted its\nstrokes —one—two—three—\n\nThe heart shot to the middle of the jar—for a moment became wholly\nrigid. Then its beating slowed, I stared, listened. Yes, its beats were\ntimed exactly with each stroke of the clock. They came slowly,\nrelentlessly, like a knell. I kept on counting.\n\n—Eight—nine—ten—eleven—twelve.\n\nAt the last stroke the heart again became rigid. Then it sank slowly to\nthe bottom of the jar and lay there motionless.\n\n“I have won!” I told myself fiercely, exultingly, “I have beaten it! It\nwas my nerves, but I have conquered them.”\n\nSurely a sedative could do no harm now, I thought. The crisis had\npassed; I had shown my strength. So I hastily bared my arm and pricked\ninto it a double dosage of morphine.\n\nLanguor came speedily. I decided to not wait for Leon. So I went to bed,\nfell into a heavy sleep—and dreamed.\n\nI dreamed about the heart—this reddish-brown lump on the mantel. I\ndreamed that it had eyes, that it watched me. I dreamed that it had a\nsoul, a soul that was troubled and that troubled me. I dreamed that it\nhad power, invisible and terrible; power that charmed me, cowed me,\nmolded me, tortured me.\n\nI must have slept solidly throughout the night. I do not remember of\nawaking a single time. All I remember is that it was a night of hideous\ndreams against which I was powerless.\n\nI was awakened by a clatter at the stairs, by a pounding on the door, by\na voice crying shrilly, queerly:\n\n“Henri! Let me in, Henri! Let me in!”\n\nI sprang up, into the study room, and opened the door.\n\nFrancois Bourlin stumbled in, his face as chalklike as the white of his\neyes.\n\n“Henri—haven’t you heard—” he began in a panicky tremolo.\n\n“Heard?” I stammered. “What?”\n\n“About Leon. Ah, it is terrible I All on account of that\nwoman—Fanchette! Leon has been arrested—has confessed! Last night at\ntwelve o’clock the police found Leblanc’s mutilated body in a sewer in\nthe Rue de Loix. He had been dead for at least two days.”\n\nFrançois clutched my arm fearfully, and his voice fell to a husky\nwhisper:\n\n“Leon—Leon had cut his heart out!”\n\nI recoiled. Then my eyes flashed to the jar on the mantel. Glistening in\nthe fresh morning light, against the white background of wall was a\nshriveled lump, inert, silent, dead. And I knew that it would never beat\nagain.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Smith of the\nCriminal Intelligence Department of India threw open the door of his\nfirst-class compartment and strolled indolently through the throng of\nshouting natives toward the station restaurant. Shrill-voiced\npawnee-wallahs lugged their skins of water from window to window of the\nthird-class carriages and sweetmeat venders cried the virtues of their\nconfections as they held their trays aloft.\n\nIt was an old story to Smith and one might have thought that he paid no\nattention whatever to his surroundings. He gave no sign of interest but\nin reality he was keenly interested. Three times during the last ten\ndays had his life been attempted. It was well for him to be on the\nalert.\n\nAfter a light tiffin Smith sauntered up and down the platform for a few\nminutes before the train was due to resume its long journey to Calcutta.\nHe was the only white man among the crowds of natives. Indeed there were\nonly two first-class compartments on the entire train. One of\nthese—directly in rear of Smith’s compartment—was reserved for ladies.\nAn unusually old ayah scuttled backwards and forwards between this\ncompartment and the restaurant. She was busy with refreshments for her\nmistress, who preferred not to leave the train and who kept her blinds\ndrawn against the curious gaze of the natives.\n\nSharp toots of warning from the engine caused Smith to turn abruptly and\nenter his compartment. As he closed the door behind him he heard it\nopened again and he turned like a flash to ascertain the cause.\nUnexpected occurrences had come to have ominous significance for him of\nlate.\n\nWhat Smith saw upon turning, however, did not seem very dangerous. He\nwas a dapper, little man who entered, smooth shaven and far from strong\nin physical appearance. He threw his topee into the rack for small\nparcels and sat down upon the seat opposite to the one upon which\nSmith’s kit was lying. No word was spoken. White men who live in India\ndo not talk much without a formal introduction.\n\nSmith paid as little outward attention to his new traveling companion as\nhe had paid to the throngs of natives upon the station platform. As the\ntrain gathered way he stretched himself full length upon his seat and\nlighted a cigarette. Notwithstanding his apparent indifference, however,\nSmith had noted several things which the ordinary observer might have\nfailed to perceive. Instinctively he felt that the little man had\nattempted to display an easy manner that he did not feel when he threw\nthe topee into the rack.\n\nSmith felt that the act was an attempt at nonchalance and was not\ngenuine. He noted, too, that the man had no native servant which is\nunusual for the first-class traveler of the East. In addition to this\nthe eyes of the little man had a story to tell. They were not straight\neyes. They were shifty and it was Smith’s profession to read eyes.\n\nHe closed his own as he tossed his cigarette out of the window, but\nopened them again at once. The man on the opposite seat was looking at\nSmith and he was looking at Smith’s eyes.\n\nSmith stretched wearily and settled a pillow more comfortably as if\npreparing for a snooze. The shifty eyes had darted away and the little\nman busied himself in examining the rush screen in the center window\nupon his side which is constructed so that water may drip downward and\ncool the air by evaporation.\n\nSmith observed the sudden interest in something other than himself and\nread the action once more as not being genuine. Again he closed his eyes\nand it was impossible to see that they fluttered open just far enough\nfor observation. It was hot and sultry and sleep comes easily and\nunexpectedly under these conditions. Smith knew this and he knew that\nhis life might depend upon his remaining awake. He might be wrong but\nhis life of adventure had taught him the value of deduction combined\nwith intuition. Previously the man he was hunting had sent natives to\nkill him. Now he had sent another white man. If Smith could last out\nlong enough the man himself would come and then the battle would be\ndecided once and for all—one way or the other.\n\nThe man on the seat opposite soon lost interest in the automatic cooler.\nHe drew a small book from his pocket and settled back as if to read. As\nthe train rattled on along the Madras coast the reader’s eyes glanced\nover the top of his book at the tall man stretched silently upon the\nseat. Gradually Smith’s breathing became deeper and more uniform. Once\nthe little man dropped his book but the breathing did not alter. A\nminute or two afterwards he rose from his seat and took a pace toward\nSmith, only to sit down again very suddenly as the door of the tiny\nservants’ compartment opened.\n\nLanga Doonh’s spotless white livery and towering turban were as\nimmaculate on board train as they were when standing behind his master’s\nchair at a dinner party. It was one of Langa Doonh’s secrets—and he had\nmany since he had entered the service of Smith sahib. Other servants\nmight be dirty when they traveled and none too clean at any time, but\nLanga Doonh was the servant of Smith sahib who was the greatest sahib in\nall India—to Langa Doonh.\n\nTo all appearances it made no difference whether the little man had sat\ndown leisurely or hurriedly. He might have been a thousand miles away\nfor all the attention he was accorded by the servant who had so suddenly\nentered the compartment. Silently, with bare feet, he moved about. With\na small whisk he cleaned every inch of floor upon his master’s side of\nthe compartment and not an inch did he touch upon the stranger’s side.\nWith mathematical precision he adjusted Smith’s cigarettes, matches and\nwatch which lay upon the small table at his head. This finished he\nwithdrew to his own compartment and closed the door without the\nslightest sound.\n\nFive minutes followed, during which Smith’s even breathing continued and\nthe stranger read but failed to turn a page of his book. At the end of\nthat time the little man dropped one hand into his side pocket. No\nlonger was he looking at the book, although it was still held in his\nleft hand. His eyes narrowed as they gazed hard at the prostrate man\nwhose steady breathing showed no sign of altering. Little by little the\nright hand came out of the pocket and with it emerged a black automatic.\nIt was half out when Smith spoke.\n\n“Put it on the seat beside you and be careful not to point the muzzle\nthis way.”\n\nSmith’s eyes were open and over his leg was pointing the barrel of a gun\nquite as black and formidable as the stranger’s. Quickly the little man\nobeyed and, dropping his book, sat motionless. There was nothing else to\ndo.\n\n“Sahib call?”\n\nThe door of the servants’ compartment stood open and Langa Doonh\nregarded the scene as if automatic pistols were matters of ordinary\noccurrence in his life.\n\n“Cigarette aur dyasali lao,” drawled Smith.\n\nCarefully the boy reached for the cigarettes and matches. Extracting a\nsingle cigarette he placed it in the disengaged hand of his master and,\nlighting a match, applied it to the cigarette when Smith was ready. Not\nonce did he come between the muzzle of his master’s gun and the man\nopposite. For an instant he hesitated and then returned to his own\ncompartment, closing the door once more.\n\n“Why shouldn’t I clean my pistol?” asked the stranger, who had had time\nto think a little.\n\n“Because I got mine out first,” snapped Smith. “Pass yours over with the\nmuzzle toward yourself.”\n\nThe man shrugged his shoulders and obeyed.\n\n“Stand up, turn your back and grip the rack above your head with both\nhands,” ordered Smith.\n\nSmith rose and searched the man but found nothing beyond a railroad\nticket to Calcutta and a few rupee notes of low denomination. He reached\nup and took one of the man’s hands off the rack in order to examine a\ncurious turquoise ring. He slipped the ring off the finger but returned\nit upon finding no initials upon the inside. Shoving the man down into\nhis seat in no gentle manner Smith resumed his reclining position as if\nthe affair had lost interest for him.\n\n“What’s your name?” he queried indifferently.\n\nThere was no answer from the stranger, who remained inert and crumpled\nin the corner of his seat where he had been jammed.\n\n“It doesn’t matter,” continued Smith. “Go to your master and tell him\nthat the wholesale stealing of jewels in India for sale to tourists in\nCeylon must stop. He knows that I caught his best agent in Ceylon and\nthat his business is already crippled. Tell him that it will only be a\nmatter of time before I catch him and that I may not bother to take him\nalive since he has sent so many people to put me out of the way.”\n\n“You mean that I am free to go?” asked the little man in surprise.\n\n“Uh-huh,” said Smith.\n\n“When?”\n\n“Now, if you like,” was the careless reply.\n\nSuddenly the eyes of the little man gleamed. Rising, he darted to the\ndoor, opened it and stepped out.\n\nThe train was crawling up an incline and there was a sandy embankment\nbeside the roadbed. Smith did not even trouble himself to look out.\n\n“Boy!” he called.\n\n“Sahib?” replied the native servant, who had opened his door instantly.\n\n“Darwaza bundo!”\n\nUnconcernedly the native closed the door which the dapper little man had\nleft open when he stepped out. What mattered it to Langa Doonh if his\nmaster had seen fit to throw another sahib out of the compartment? It\nwas quite proper for his master to do such a thing but it would be\nhighly improper for him to bother closing the door afterwards so long as\nhe, Langa Doonh, was present.\n\nAlone once more Smith again lay back upon his pillow and reflected upon\nthe situation. Was his course of action best suited to bring out the man\nhe wanted? Would the head of the organization of thieves attempt a\npersonal blow when so many of his agents continued to fail? Did he lack\npersonal courage or was he, perhaps, known to Smith and feared\nrecognition in the event of a failure to kill? These and similar\nthoughts occupied the mind of the man upon the carriage seat until he\nwas suddenly interrupted in a most unexpected manner.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Sobbing Woman\n\nLeaping to his feet Smith pressed an ear against the thin partition\nwhich separated his compartment from the one in the rear. Above the\nnoise of the train he had distinctly heard a feminine shriek. Again,\nwith his ear against the wood, he heard the high-pitched agonized call\nof a woman. The screams changed quickly to a low groaning which could\nscarcely be distinguished and then only the rattle of the train\nremained.\n\nFor an instant Smith reached for the chain of the emergency alarm but,\nchanging his mind, opened the door and leaned out. It was before the\ntime that the Government did away with the running-boards on account of\nthe number of murders by assassins who crept along the outside of trains\nand struck through the open windows at those who slept.\n\nSmith glanced at the foot-board with a question in his eyes. It was\npossible—just possible—that the little man had not jumped off the train,\nafter all. With care he could have bent low and crept back along the\ntrain. Would he have dared to attack a woman so close to an agent of the\nCriminal Intelligence Department? Smith thought not. Was it a trap? It\nseemed impossible.\n\nNo matter what might be the explanation, a woman in distress had\ncalled—and Smith swung himself out upon the running-board. As he clung\nto the hand-grips on the outside of the swaying train and worked his way\nbackward the head of Langa Doonh protruded from one of the windows.\n\n“Sahib?” the boy whispered enquiringly.\n\nSmith placed a finger upon his lips and motioned his servant back just\nas he passed the last of his own compartment windows.\n\nA hurt look spread over the face of the native boy as he withdrew from\nthe window. Sometimes, when his master went upon particularly hazardous\nexpeditions, Langa Doonh was left behind. The boy grieved over these\noccurrences but, above all else, he had to obey. To disobey Smith sahib\nwas so utterly impossible as to be beyond his imagination.\n\nThere being nothing else to do, Langa Doonh decided to clean the\ncompartment once more. He was bending over to brush up the dust and\ncinders that had accumulated when something hard flew through the window\nupon the opposite side of the train to that upon which Smith had made\nhis exit. Langa Doonh fell senseless to the floor, while a heavy rock\nlay by his head. Instantly the almost naked body of a native wriggled\nthrough the window from whence the stone had come.\n\nThe intruding native knelt quickly and proceeded to bind the hands and\nfeet of his victim with a stout cord that he took from around his waist.\nWith a strip torn from his loin-cloth he forced a gag into Langa Doonh’s\nmouth and dragged him most unceremoniously back into his tiny\ncompartment, the door of which he bolted before climbing out through the\nsame window through which he had entered.\n\nAs Smith reached the first window of the compartment in rear of the one\nhe had left he held with one hand to the iron support while, with the\nother, he nursed his gun just inside the breast of his pongee coat. Very\ncarefully he raised his head and looked inside.\n\nThere was but one occupant to be seen. Upon the opposite seat lay a\nyoung woman. Her back was turned and she appeared to be sobbing her\nheart out into a cushion. Her body shook almost as if in convulsions.\n\nSmith spoke, but the distracted woman paid no attention or failed to\nhear the rather low voice above the rattle of the train. His eyes\nsearching every corner of the compartment and keenly inspecting the\nfigure of the crying woman, Smith moved on from window to window until\nhe reached the door, which he opened, and stepped inside. For a minute\nor two he stood motionless while he examined the contents of the\ncompartment, noting white-covered umbrella, gloves, green veiling and\nsome toilet articles upon the small table. Everything appeared to be\ngenuine—and yet Smith was not satisfied.\n\nTurning to the door of the servants’ compartment he jerked it quickly\nopen and glanced inside. Lying upon the floor, with her head resting\nupon her bundle, was the old ayah whom Smith had seen upon the station\nplatform. Her closed eyes and heavy breathing gave every indication of\nsleep, which is so commonly indulged in, whenever possible, by the\nnative during the heat of the day.\n\nSmith closed the door very quietly. Since entering the compartment\nSmith’s eyes had not left the figure of the sobbing woman for more than\na couple of seconds. He felt that something was wrong and, intuitively,\nhe sensed the presence of danger but he could not tell where it lay.\n\nNot quite decided as to his course of action, Smith opened the door\nopposite to that which he had entered and threw one swift look back\ntoward the compartment he had left. Even then, although he had seen that\nwhich caused him deep concern, his eyes flashed back to the figure of\nthe girl, whose sobbing had nearly ceased. He had just seen a strange\nnative crawling from the window of his own compartment. The incident\nneeded quick investigation but first he must question the girl.\n\nSmith took one step toward the now silent girl and his lanky,\nloose-framed body tensed as he crouched into the springing attitude of\none of the jungle beasts of prey. Such a little thing he had seen—just\nan exposed finger upon which was a peculiar turquoise ring. The sudden\ncrouch undoubtedly saved his life. There was the sharp crack of a small\ncaliber pistol as the girl raised her head and fired over her reclining\nbody.\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Pearl Buyer of Calcutta\n\nSmith did not return the fire although his pistol was drawn. Instead he\nhurled his body forward as the beast of prey that he resembled might\nhave done. One long arm shot out and the pistol was seized with lean\nfingers and wrenched away before the girl could press the trigger a\nsecond time. The girl, nonplussed by the suddenness of her defeat, sat\nup, her face exposed. A broad grin spread over Smith’s face. All his\nindolence of manner returned. Carelessly he stretched out a hand and\nlifted the mass of curls from her head. Before him sat the dapper little\nman who had pretended to jump from the train.\n\n“Got any more guns?” asked Smith.\n\nThe little man sullenly shook his head but Smith made certain by a\nthorough patting from head to foot.\n\n“Put your hair on again.” continued Smith, tossing back the curly wig.\n“and climb back into my compartment. You are cleverer than I thought and\nI think I’ll take you to Calcutta. You are almost clever enough to be\nthe man I am after; but no,”—Smith paused in thought—“he would have\nremoved the turquoise ring.”\n\nThe man in woman’s attire looked down at the ring and sullenly turned\nthe blue stone in.\n\n“So that was what warned you,” he commented. “Shall I get out of these\nwoman’s things?”\n\n“No,” returned Smith. “Get out on the running-board and back to my\ncompartment just as you are. If you try to jump off I’ll shoot you\nbefore you touch the ground.”\n\nFew people hang their heads out of the windows of Indian trains on the\nlong, dusty stretches between stations. Nobody saw a man and a woman\nclinging to the foot-board of the swaying train. Had they done so they\nwould have noticed that the woman went first and that the man did not\nbother to offer the slightest assistance to his companion. Indeed, when\nthe woman came opposite to the first window of the adjoining compartment\nshe caught her skirt on a loose screw of an iron hand-grip and seemed to\nbe in considerable difficulty. Even then the man, only a few feet behind\nher, offered no help. After considerable delay, however, he became\nimpatient and spoke in a low voice.\n\n“Move on,” he said, “or I’ll shoot your dress free.”\n\nThe delay had considerably exasperated Smith, who was anxious to\nascertain what the strange native had been doing in his compartment. As\nhe followed his captive through the door he dropped the gun, which he\nhad been carrying, into his side pocket and turned toward the servants’\ncompartment.\n\n“Your hands up, old chap, if you don’t mind.”\n\nSmith wheeled, but it was too late. Stretched full length upon the long\nseat, so close to the windows as to have been invisible to Smith as he\nclimbed along the running-board, was the ayah—the infirm old native\nwoman who had apparently been sleeping so soundly but a few minutes\nbefore. In her hand was a pistol and Smith’s hands slowly went above his\nhead. It was the ayah and yet it was not. The sluggish mentality of an\nold native woman was gone and with it the timorous attitude of the\nhumble servant. Only his long training in self-control allowed Smith to\ndepict the outward indifference that he was far from feeling.\n\n“Just turn your back, old dear,” continued the man’s voice of this\nstrange ayah, “while a woman takes off a few of her clothes.”\n\nIt was undoubtedly a man who spoke and with the words he rose and began\nunwinding a long, dirty sari from about his head and waist. With the\nsari came the gray matted wig, revealing nut-brown, close-cropped hair.\n\n“Shall I go through his pockets?” asked the dapper little man. “He’s got\na gun.”\n\n“You have blundered twice already, Higgins,” was the reply in sarcastic\ntones. “I would as soon trust a baby with a razor as I would you with\nthis man again. Go back to my compartment and bring my clothes. Change\nyour own while you are there.”\n\nAs Higgins once more climbed out upon the foot-board the other man\ntossed out of a window the long, cotton, bandage-like garment and\nrevealed a circle of dark skin where a skimpy white jacket failed to\nreach down to a sagging woolen skirt. Deftly he picked Smith’s gun from\nhis pocket and, with a few expert pats, located and extracted the two\npistols that Smith had taken from Higgins. Meanwhile Smith, tall and\nangular, stood silently with his hands up and his back turned.\n\n“Now that your teeth are drawn, Mr.—ah—Smith, you might make yourself\ncomfortable on the opposite seat.” Smith quietly did as was suggested\nand gazed, in a bored manner, at the opposite seat, where sat the\nincongruous figure of a white man partly disguised as an old native\nwoman. He gave but a glance at the gun resting on the seat beside his\ncompanion and then studied the remarkably clever make-up on the face. As\nhe looked he began to smile.\n\n“So you came down the opposite side of the carriage and arrived first\nwhile our friend Higgins pretended to have his skirt caught and so\ndelayed me?”\n\n“A fairly clever deduction,” returned the man with the gun. “Anything\nelse you would like to ask?”\n\n“It would interest me to know why Mr. Sterne, the well-known pearl buyer\nof Calcutta, has taken to thieving.”\n\n“I am honored by your recognition,” was the suave reply. “Perhaps you\nremember a game of billiards that we had at the club. You said then that\nthe only profession more exciting than the detection of crime was the\nprofession of the criminal. That is true. You do not detect crime for\nmoney but for the excitement. There is not sufficient excitement in your\nprofession to satisfy me.”\n\n“And yet,” continued Smith in an easy conversational tone, “throughout\nall India your word is known to be as good as your certified check.”\n\n“To break one’s word is to lose one’s self-respect,” replied Sterne. “To\nsteal is to lose the respect of a few people for whose esteem you may\nnot care a snap of your finger.”\n\n“All honest men despise a thief.”\n\n“There are few honest men,” was the cool reply, “and most of them are\nstupid.”\n\n“May I smoke?” asked Smith, languidly gazing out of the window, although\nhe was keenly estimating the distance to the next station.\n\nSterne took a package of Smith’s own cigarettes from the table and\ntossed it over. He followed it with a box of matches before adding:\n\n“We are coming to the small town of Ellore. It is extremely unlikely\nthat there will be any first-class passengers or that anybody will come\nnear this compartment. However, I will pull down the blinds on this\nside, which is next to the station. Whatever happens I will handle the\nsituation, and if you make the slightest untoward move I shall be forced\nto shoot—and shoot to kill.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nSmith’s Dispatch Box\n\nSmith made no reply and smoked lazily, leaning back with his eyes half\nclosed. He was puzzled about Langa Doonh. He knew that the boy’s\ntraining would make him try to keep in touch with his master. Had he\nheard through his thin door? If so, what was he doing? Had he met with\nfoul play at the hands of the strange native? Smith feared for his\nservant and it worried him even more than his own awkward predicament.\n\nWhen the train stopped at Ellore it was just as Sterne had anticipated.\nNo stranger came near their compartment. A few seconds before the train\nstarted, however, Higgins entered from the platform, dressed in his own\nclothes and with a suitcase in his hand.\n\n“Sit here,” directed Sterne very curtly. “Take this gun and shoot him if\nhe moves.”\n\nSmith reflected that it was fifty miles to the next station, which was\nRajahmundry, an important one on the Godavery River. At Rajahmundry he\nfelt sure that the guard would look into his compartment. Instinctively\nhe knew that his critical moment must arrive before the train stopped\nagain. The failure of his boy to appear at the last station convinced\nhim that he had to depend entirely upon himself. Only his own wits could\nsave him.\n\nMeanwhile Sterne had opened the suitcase and taken out a bottle of\nwhitish fluid with which he liberally sponged face, neck, hands and\nwrists. Magically the dark skin turned to the sunburned hue of the\naverage European. Disregarding the remainder of his body he quickly\ndonned the white man’s garb, standing forth in a faultlessly pressed\nsuit of white flannels. The transformation was almost incredible. Where\nhad been a slovenly old ayah was a smartly dressed white man of India.\n\n‘‘While I was dressing, an idea occurred to me,” said Sterne, taking the\npistol from Higgins and sitting down opposite to Smith. “It is foolish\nfor any man to commit murder so long as he can get somebody else to do\nit for a few hundred rupees. Any man with brains would be willing to pay\nmore than that to escape the danger of the death penalty. However,\nnobody seems to be able to kill you—even when you walk straight into my\ntrap. It remains for me to do it. Isn’t that reasonable?”\n\n“Uh-huh,” said Smith very casually, “but what’s the idea that occurred\nto you while dressing?”\n\n“Look!” continued Sterne, carelessly throwing open the door of the small\nservants’ compartment. “My servant carried out my orders in regard to\nyour servant.”\n\nThrough the open door Smith saw the bound form of Langa Doonh lying upon\nthe floor. A great load was lifted from his mind at the sight. Smith was\nfond of Langa Doonh, and dead people do not have their legs tied.\n\n“I merely show you this so that you may know how utterly helpless you\nare,” continued Sterne as he closed the door and resumed his seat. “It\nwould be weak-minded for me to kill you if I can find another solution.\nYou have intimated that I never break my word. The same truth applies to\nyou. Every criminal in India knows it. Your word would be accepted by\nany thief with brains if he has worked long in this country.”\n\n“Your proposition?” drawled Smith.\n\n“I will spare your life,” returned Sterne, “if you will promise to do as\nI tell you.”\n\nSmith merely raised his eyebrows in an interrogative manner.\n\n“You will get off the train at Rajahmundrv,” continued Sterne, “and go\ndown the Godavery River by native boat to Yanaon, which is a French\npossession. There you will take ship out of India and you will never set\nfoot in this country again.”\n\n“An interesting idea,” replied Smith but showing slight interest. “Will\nyou entertain a counter proposition from me?”\n\n“Proceed.”\n\n“I will give you two hundred thousand rupees in jewels if you will go\ndown the Godavery River and leave the country as you would have me do.”\n\n“Scarcely enough, old dear,” bantered Sterne, but a gleam came into his\neyes.\n\n“You forget,” argued Smith, “that you will avoid the necessity of\nkilling me and thereby escape the unpleasantness of a death penalty\nhanging over your head. That surely is worth several lakhs of rupees.”\n\nThrough his half-shut eyes, as he smoked. Smith believed that he could\ndetect upon the face of his opponent the faintest trace of cunning\ncovetousness. He was fencing for his life and was about to deliver his\nmost skilful thrust. Failure to penetrate his adversary’s guard almost\nsurely would forfeit his life or his honor. With apparent unconcern he\nflicked the ash from his cigarette and waited for the reply.\n\n“Just—a—what jewels are these?”\n\n“The loot that your organization collected and which came into my hands\nwhen I captured your lieutenant in Ceylon.”\n\nSterne’s eyes narrowed as he scrutinized the face of the agent of the\nCriminal Intelligence Department. He knew that Smith was far removed\nfrom a fool and he tried to read the thoughts of the man who smoked his\ncigarette so calmly in the face of death or dishonor.\n\n“I had hoped to use the jewels,” continued Smith, “to bait a very\nbeautiful trap for you in Calcutta.”\n\n“You have them here?”\n\nSmith’s eyelids quivered ever so little. It might have been smoke and it\nmight have been nervousness. He was playing to a subtle audience and the\nleast bit of overacting would be fatal.\n\n“Is it a bargain?” he asked. “Will you accept the jewels?”\n\n“I have made no promise but I will inspect your dispatch box,” replied\nSterne, indicating with his pistol a leather-covered box of considerable\nsize which lay upon the floor. “If the jewels are there they are mine\nwithout the trouble of making a bargain.”\n\n“Permit me to open the box,” offered Smith, extracting a small key from\nhis pocket and bending forward rather eagerly.\n\n“Sit back!” snapped Sterne. “Throw me the key.”\n\nSmith tossed over the key and shrugged his shoulders resignedly while\nSterne glanced from the dispatch box to Higgins and hesitated.\n\n“Open the box for the gentleman, Higgins, like a good boy,” interposed\nSmith with what might possibly have been a gleam of hope in his eyes.\n\n“Shoot him if he gets off his seat,” said Sterne, shoving a spare pistol\nacross to Higgins. “Smith, for some reason, you want anybody but me to\nopen that box and that is just the reason I shall open it myself.”\n\n“Go to the devil!” growled Smith.\n\nSterne smiled in amusement as he dragged the box in front of his feet\nupon the floor. He unbuckled the leather cover and threw it back,\nexposing the top of the steel box within. Smith bent forward a trifle as\nif to watch the opening of the box. In reality it brought him a few\ninches nearer to Higgins and allowed his body to assume an attitude that\nwould permit a spring.\n\n“No false move!” warned Sterne, looking up and feeling the gun beside\nhim on the seat.\n\nHiggins stood up as Steme inserted the key and could not resist\nglimpsing the operation out of the tail of his eye. Mainly, however, he\nwatched Smith and kept his gun well forward.\n\n“Look out for the Jack-in-the-box when you lift the cover,” warned Smith\nwith a chuckle. “My trap may be better than yours.”’\n\nIt was a subtle speech and a most audacious one. Sterne grunted\ncontemptuously, turned the key and lifted the steel cover. There was\nexposed the usual upper tray containing papers, pens, pencils and other\nodds and ends.\n\n“Gracyous me! The ugly face didn’t jump out!” jibed Smith.\n\n“Hold your tongue!” snarled Sterne.\n\nOn either side of the tray were two brass lifters that sank in slots,\nflush with the tray, when not being used for raising it. Sterne inserted\ntwo fingers of each hand under these brass loops and lifted. They rose\nfreely for a good two inches and then came a violent clang from within\nthe box while the loops shot downward, crushing the fingers to the bone\nand holding them fast against the heavy box.\n\n“Shoot!” screamed Sterne.\n\nWith the clang and the scream Smith’s body catapulted toward Higgins\nwhile his long right arm sent his clenched fist straight at the solar\nplexus of the man with the gun. It was a desperate attempt and might\nhave ended in disaster had not Langa Doonh bounded through the door at\nthat very moment and struck up the pistol so that the bullet went six\ninches over Smith’s head. The next instant the blow landed and Higgins\ncrumpled into a senseless heap upon the floor.\n\nAfter collecting the various guns Smith turned his attention to Sterne,\nwhose forehead was streaming with perspiration from pain and fury.\n\nUnconcernedly he pressed a concealed spring in the box and released the\nman’s fingers.\n\n“Nice little trap, wasn’t it?” he commented. “Better than yours, eh\nwhat?”\n\n“Sahib,” said Langa Doonh, “boy very sorry to get tied up. Only could\nwork loose just now. Sahib angry?”\n\n“Not at all,” replied Smith, busily engaged in handcuffing the sullen\nSterne and the senseless Higgins.\n\n“Sahib like clean shirt?”\n\n“Uh-huh,” said Smith, “might as well.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Corporal Hal Robberts, New York state trooper, halted, his whipcord body of his tensing beneath the trim gray and black uniform. For a moment he listened, his gloved hand sliding back to the comforting assurance of the big .45 Colt belted around the sheepskin coat.\n\nThen he pushed slowly forward. A snow-covered branch caught the toe of his snowshoe, tripping him. Simultaneously came the whiplike crack of a rifle. Something tugged sharply at the trooper’s fur cap, whined off the darkness.\n\nBefore the echoes of the shot died, Robberts was wriggling his way to the shelter of a nearby spruce.\n\n“Some crazy poacher.” he muttered. There was no one else it could be for on this particular assignment the lean-faced trooper earned no warrant in his pocket. But knowing the peculiar breed of men in the mountains Robberts slid the .45 into his hand and waited.\n\nOnly a fool would charge that hidden rifle with only a revolver. And Robberts was no fool. There w ere plenty of men in this remote section of the Adirondacks—men who had lived alone until their minds had slightly cracked—who would shoot down an officer if they feared arrest for some petty poaching offense.\n\nStealthily, foot by foot, the trooper wormed his way from the shelter of the pine. Taking advantage of every available bit of cover, ears keenly alert, eyes striving to pierce the gathering gloom, Robberts began a tortuous circle that should bring him to the rear of the spot which he had marked as the origin of the ambusher’s shot. Suddenly, he stood erect with a muttered exclamation of disgust.\n\nA trampled spot in the snow behind the bole of a huge spruce marked the ambusher’s waiting place. Robberts picked a spent cartridge from the ground. But that meant nothing, for the cartridge was a .32-40, which would fit a third of the woodsmen’s rifles. For a moment, he stared at the webbed tracks of snowshoes that led off into the gloom, debating. Then he shrugged; no use to swing out on the trail tonight for in ten minutes pitch darkness would envelop the mountains. But he could camp nearby, and in the morning trail down the maker of those crisscrossed tracks.\n\nFor fifteen minutes the trooper slogged on through the snow and increasing cold. Suddenly he halted, staring at a steady gleam of light that flickered from the darkness a few hundred yards ahead of him.\n\nTen minutes later Robberts was standing before a rude cabin from which light streamed through dingy window panes. He paused for a moment, striking a match and examining a pair of snowshoes hanging from a peg in the outside wall. But these were not the webs worn by that would- be killer back in the timber. Robberts knocked, then pushed open the door.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nAmos Norton\n\nA bulky man, face covered with a heavy growth of beard, arose and peered at the trooper through thick-lensed spectacles.\n\n“Howdy, officer,” the man said pleasantly, glancing at Robberts’ black-striped breeches protruding from beneath the sheepskin coat. “Cold, ain’t it?”\n\n“Plenty,” agreed Robberts, throwing cap and coat upon the bunk. “I’m looking for a place to hole up for the night.”\n\n‘You’ve hit it,” the bearded man returned cordially. “My name’s Fred Dorgan. Been trapping some here, tryin’ to make out the winter.”\n\n“Any luck?” asked Robberts idly.\n\nDorgan pointed with pride to several rows of furs hanging across the walls of the cabin. “Not bad. Average catch, I’d say. Take it easy while I rustle up a little grub. What takes you out this weather, if it isn’t an official secret?”\n\n“No secret,” the trooper said easily, “in fact, you may be able to help me. I’m Corporal Robberts, state trooper, from the Malone barracks. A bunch of us have been busy the past week searching for that big transport plane that crashed somewhere in the mountains. I happened to be assigned this territory. Haven’t heard or seen anything of a crash around here, have you?”\n\nDorgan shook his head as he sliced bacon into a frying pan. “Nope, but that don’t mean that the plane couldn’t have cracked up not far away. Here in the cabin, with the wind howling outside, sounds don’t carry from very far. Any passengers in the plane?”\n\nRobberts shook his head.\n\n“No, just the pilot and co-pilot. The ship was carrying a bank shipment of currency though, and there’s been a great row raised about it.” He fished a paper from his pocket and opened it. “Pilot Walter Amsden, thirty-two, slender, brown hair. Copilot Frank Monroe, twenty-six, tall, redheaded. That’s their description.”\n\n“Tell you what,” Dorgan volunteered, “I’ll make the rounds of my line early in the morning, then go out with you. We might stumble on something.”\n\nA short time later Robberts pushed back from the crude table and reached for his pipe.\n\n“Some one took a pop at me with a rifle, back in the timber tonight,” he said casually.\n\nThe trooper fished the cartridge from his pocket, and rising, crossed to where a Winchester hung on the wall. But the weapon was a .30-30, and. the empty shell in his hand was a .32-40.\n\n“Who’s got a grudge against the troopers up here?” Robberts snapped abruptly.\n\nDorgan hesitated. “No one I know of, unless—”\n\n“Unless what?” barked the trooper.\n\n“I don’t want to get any innocent party in trouble,” Dorgan said uneasily, “but there’s a queer old nut a few miles north of here that’s apt to do most anything. Took a crack at me one day.” “What’s his name?”\n\n“Amos Norton,” Dorgan answered, “he’s got a .32-40 rifle, too.”\n\n“I’ve heard of him,” Robberts said grimly. “One of the patrols brought him in to the precinct one day for poaching. He swore then he’d kill the next trooper he met in the woods.”\n\n“Well, if we’re going to hunt for that crash in the morning, we’d better turn in,” said Dorgan.\n\nIt was not yet dawn when Dorgan returned from his inspection of his trap line, and a short time later both men were slogging through deep snow into the timber.\n\n“I’ve got only a few traps left out,” Dorgan explained his short absence before dawn. “Been thinkin’ of tryin’ a different part of the country. Old Man Norton ain’t what I call a desirable neighbor.”\n\nA short distance from Dorgan’s cabin Robberts called a halt. “We’ll separate here, and cover as much ground as possible. If either of us finds anything he can fire two quick shots to call the other. You tell me where Norton’s shack is, and we’ll meet near there, and pay the old boy a visit.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Tri-Motor\n\nAfter Dorgan had given detailed directions for finding Norton’s cabin, the two separated. For an hour Robberts followed the course of a small winding river. Suddenly, a small black object near the foot of a spruce caught his attention. Curiously, the trooper strode to the spot and looked down at a fine pine marten, securely imprisoned in a steel trap. The little animal was frozen stiff by the intense cold. Robberts examined the trap staring for a long moment at the initials scratched in the steel. When he straightened a long whistle of satisfaction escaped his lips. Mind busy with a dozen thoughts he resumed his search.\n\nThe forenoon was half gone when Corporal Robberts broke through a protecting fringe of brush and gazed out over the frozen expanse of a tiny lake. And in the center of the lake lay a heap of blackened wreckage.\n\nHal drew his Colt and fired twice into the air before hurrying toward his find. When Dorgan came trotting across the little lake a short time later, Robberts was still examining the remains of what had once been a big tri-motored Douglas.\n\n“What a way to die!” Dorgan whispered in horror.\n\nHe was pointing at the snow-covered figure of a man sprawled a few yards from the wreck. Nodding in sombre agreement, Robberts turned the body over, gazed down into the features of a young man wearing the leather coat and goggles of a flyer.\n\n“That’s Co-pilot Monroe, all right,” Robberts muttered. “Must have been thrown clear and struck his head on the ice. See, there’s a bad wound there”\n\n“And the pilot himself?” asked Dorgan. Robberts pointed to the ghastly little heap of bones, charred leather, and cloth that he had salvaged from the debris.\n\n“Let’s hope the crash killed him,” Dorgan mumbled nervously. “Let’s get away from here, corporal. This mess gives me the creeps!”\n\n‘You’ve forgotten something,” Robberts retorted. “There’s supposed to be a box of currency around here somewhere!”\n\nAt the end of fifteen minutes’ futile search Corporal Robberts gazed at Dorgan with a queer light in his steel-gray eyes.\n\n“Maybe it burned with the plane,” Dorgan ventured.\n\n“Impossible,” snapped the trooper. “The box was fire-proof. Dorgan, there’s dirty’ work here. Some one’s salvaged $75,000 from this crash and made off with it!”\n\nDorgan said nothing, but his lips slowly framed a name. Robberts nodded, strapped the snowshoes again on his feet.\n\n“We’re making a little call right now on your friend, Amos Norton!”\n\nSun danced blindingly on dazzling white snow as the trooper and Dorgan cautiously approached Norton’s ramshackle cabin. A tenuous thread of smoke eddying from the crazy chimney was the only sign of life about the place.\n\nHand on holstered Colt ready for instant action, Robberts boldly approached the cabin. A hard shove of his shoulder sent the rickety door flying wide open. Gun in hand, the state trooper lunged through the doorway, Dorgan at his heels. One brief look showed that the single-room cabin was empty. But a can of water simmered on the stove, and supplies and equipment were scattered carelessly everywhere.\n\n“Looks as if he’s coming back, anyway,” remarked Robberts. “Watch for him, Dorgan, while I take a look for that money.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nAin’t Seen No Plane\n\nA thorough search of the cabin revealed no trace of the missing currency. Robberts stepped outside and glanced keenly around the cabin walls. A sizable pile of firewood was stacked neatly against one end of the shack. The next moment the trooper began a systematic dismantling of the piled wood.\n\nSuddenly he straightened, a gleam of triumph in his eyes. In his hand was a shiny metal box. The missing money container! Eagerly he opened it, peered inside. Crisp green bank notes, neatly packed in a small bundle, partially filled the box. Carefully Robberts counted them, whistling softly in satisfaction. Though only a small portion of the lost cash was in the box the tall man in uniform seemed hugely content as he hurried back into the cabin.\n\n“Found part of it,” he jerked at the watching Dorgan. “Enough to convict the old fox, anyway. He’d hid it in the woodpile.”\n\n“Good!” Dorgan smiled, then—’’Look out! Norton’s coming!”\n\nRobberts ducked down, then cautiously peered through the dirty window. A lanky old man was shuffling through the snow toward the cabin, rifle swinging from one hand. Dangling over one shoulder were the furry carcasses of a fox and several mink. As the trapper came closer Robberts stared with interest at the crafty, lined face and small, glittering eyes.\n\nAmos Norton suddenly stopped, his eyes falling to the trampled tracks in the snow. At the same moment Robberts leaped through the doorway, his Colt swung up.\n\n“Put ‘em up, Norton!”\n\nWith an animal-like snarl Norton swung the rifle to his hip and fired.\n\nThe crashing report of the police .45 boomed upon the cold air as Norton’s bullet whistled inches away from the trooper’s head. As the rifle, smashed by the impact of the big revolver bullet, dropped from his hand, Norton leaped forward with a shrill cry, a long-bladed hunting knife springing like magic into his hand. Robberts was plunging at him, grimly shoving his gun back into the holster.\n\nA shot cracked from the cabin door, missing Norton’s head narrowly.\n\n“Stop it, you fool!” the trooper yelled over his shoulder. “I’ll handle this!”\n\nThen the trapper closed in, eyes gleaming with maniacal rage. He slashed once, downward, as the trooper ducked. The blade sliced the sleeve of the sheepskin coat from shoulder to elbow, then\n\nRobberts had the knife wrist in a grasp of iron.\n\nFor a moment the two men were locked in a motionless embrace of straining muscles. Norton’s strength was enormous for a man of his age, and for a moment Robberts was hard put to hold his own. Then with a lightning twist Robberts slid his free hand behind Norton’s neck, clamping it with his left upon the upraised knife hand. Exerting every ounce of muscle he possessed the trooper jerked. Norton fell heavily; the officer’s body dropped on top. A moment of furious scuffling in the snow and Robberts arose, dragging the manacled trapper with him.\n\n“Bad business, Norton, shooting at an officer, and robbing wrecked airplanes!”\n\n“You dirty, interferin’ state cop!” Norton mouthed, spitting snow and invective from his snarling mouth. “I’m sorry I missed ye last night!”\n\n“So you admit shooting at me, and robbing the mail plane?” Robberts snapped.\n\n“What? What’s that about robbin’ a mail plane?” Well-feigned astonishment spread over the trapper’s dirty face. “Sure I shot at ye, and I’m sorry I missed! But I don’t know what you’re talking about when ye speak of a plane. I ain’t seen no plane!”\n\nRobberts held the packet of money before Norton. “Ever see that before?”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Pilot Of The Douglas\n\nThe look of bewilderment vanished from Norton’s crafty features, to be replaced by fear. Abruptly he shut his traplike mouth and refused to speak again.\n\n“No use in staying here any longer,” Robberts grunted to Dorgan. “Bring his gun and come on; we’ll’ stay tonight at your cabin and I’ll take him in in the morning.”\n\nAt Dorgan’s cabin Robberts secured his captive firmly to the bunk, then turned to watch Dorgan as the big man built a fire in the rusty stove and started preparations for supper. When the simple meal was over, Robberts leaned his chair against the door and smoked for a moment lazily.\n\n“Hope you don’t have any trouble taking Norton in tomorrow,” Dorgan, said finally. “You just let me know when you want me to testify, and I’ll be on hand.”\n\n“No,” the trooper drawled, “I don’t expect any trouble. Of course, handling a pair of prisoners isn’t a kid’s job, but I guess I can swing it.”\n\n“A pair of prisoners!” Dorgan wheeled in surprise. “Why, where’s your other one?” Robberts rose slowly to his feet, his right hand hooked carelessly in the wide cartridge belt.\n\n“Slow down, mister,” he shot back, all the softness gone from his voice. “I arrest you, Walter Amsden, for the murder of Fred Dorgan and Frank Monroe! ”\n\nFor a pregnant moment the silence of death hung over the stuffy little room. Dorgan wheeled slowly from the stove, his face for a moment a malignant mask. Then his features relaxed.\n\n“What’re you talking about, trooper? You’re telling me that I’m Amsden, the pilot of that Douglas? You’re crazy! Your own description of Amsden says he was a slender man with brown hair. Well, take a look at me!”\n\n“I’m looking at you,” Robberts said quietly. “You were pretty clever, Amsden, but you slipped up on two or three little things. I first became suspicious when I looked around while you were supposed to be making the rounds of your trap lines and found that there wasn’t a sign of extra clothing about the place. A slender man, who’d dyed his hair, might put on a lot of additional clothes to make himself look bigger. So I kept my eyes open. This morning I found a marten in a trap marked with Dorgan’s initials. That meant you didn’t know the location of Dorgan’s traps!”\n\n“A fine lot of rot.”\n\n“Oh, that isn’t all,” Robberts said placidly, “you interrupted me. You planned this ‘crash,’ Amsden, for some time, marking the location of both Dorgan’s and Norton’s cabins. You even had the dye to change the color of your hair with you. You simply landed on that lake, probably already having killed the co-pilot in his seat. You came to Dorgan, got all the information about him and Norton you could. Then you killed him, changed clothes with him, and after placing him in the plane and leaving Monroe clear for future identification, you burned the ship.\n\n“But just to make sure, you planted a small part of the money at Norton’s cabin. When he took a shot at me last night, he was playing right into your hands.”\n\nDorgan, or Amsden; shifted his feet nervously.\n\n“But here’s what’s going to send you to the chair, Amsden!” Robberts cried suddenly, pointing to the shiny money box. “Your big mistake was in leaving the money you planted on Norton still in the box. For the paint on that box wasn’t even scorched, showing it was taken from the plane, before the burning, not after! ”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nSilence Like A Bombshell\n\nAs the words fell upon the silence like a bombshell, the room erupted into violent action. With a lightning swing of his arm Amsden seized the pan of scalding dishwater from the stove and flung it straight at Robberts’ face. As the trooper attempted to duck his foot slipped and he went half to his knees. Half of the contents of the pan splashed agonizingly into his face, blinding him. Instinctively his finger contacted upon the trigger of the Colt.\n\nThe bullet smashed through the flimsy stove, scattering a shower of flaming coals upon the floor. Simultaneously the roaring form of Amsden crashed into the trooper, rocking him with flailing, vicious blows.\n\nHe groped, once, for the gun dangling from its lanyard. Instantly Amsden’s fist closed on his wrist, while the pilot’s other muscular hand gripped the trooper’s throat.\n\nWith a mighty effort Robberts brought his right knee up to Amsden’s stomach, shoved with all his strength. The murderer staggered, mouthing maniacal curses, suddenly whirled and lunged toward the rifle standing in a: comer. Frantically Robberts fumbled for his .45. Amsden’s rifle came up, leveled, just as the trooper’s hand closed over the butt of the Colt.\n\nRed murder stared from Amsden’s glaring eyes as Robberts squeezed the trigger. Two thundering reports filled the cabin, pounded on Robberts’ ears through a fog of pain and powder smoke.\n\nAmsden slumped, completely cowed, in a corner, nursing a shattered shoulder. On the bunk old Amos Norton regarded the trooper with admiring eyes:\n\n“By cracky, you state cops kin fight, at that,” he said excitedly. “I ain’t goin’ to crack down on a state policeman agin! I had you figured for a bunch of nosey snoopers, but anybody that kin figure out a mess like this is okay!”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Barnes and Brentwood were the only members of the firm of Barnes, Brentwood and Company, bankers, which controlled the destinies of half the country’s industries. For fifteen years, they had been business associates and leaders in finance.\n\nBarnes had made no attempt to avoid arrest — none even to hide his crime. An elevator boy had seen him leave Brentwood’s apartment late the night before. The shot apparently had not been heard, because Brentwood’s body had not been discovered until that morning by his valet.\n\n“Why did you do it?” Thorne asked the banker the usual question, but he did it with unusual interest. He had been searching for a motive on his way out, but he could vision none.\n\nThey were on the train then, returning to New York. Barnes offered to use one of his cars for the short ride, but Thorne was afraid to take a chance in spite of his apparent submission. Before Barnes answered, he looked toward the gleam of metal under his sleeves where the handcuffs showed.\n\n“Would you mind holding a cigar for me, Inspector?”\n\nThorne looked at him a moment, then leaned over and unlocked the cuffs.\n\n“It’s a long story,” Barnes began, with a sigh of relief as he drew deep on his cigar.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nI Didn’t Argue\n\nFifteen years ago my firm was Landis and Barnes. We were bankers and brokers of the old school. At least Landis was. Conservative, more conservative than there was any need for. We had a safe business, but there was nothing in it. When I had started in as a clerk for old man Landis my one ambition had been to get in the firm. He was a leader then and he looked like he had a grip on the world. But when I did arrive I saw it was only a beginning.\n\nLandis wasn’t really old physically, but his ideas were old. Younger men all around him had passed him in the race for money. He really didn’t care an awful lot about making money. I liked him but I had to get ahead. It was just bom in me. However, he controlled the business and poohpoohed every real idea I brought to him.\n\nWe went right on making money his way, but it wasn’t my way. I knew it was the time to cut loose for big things and I started planning on them. I couldn’t leave Landis, because I needed his help for a while.\n\nJust about that time Brentwood came to work for me. I had insisted on a private secretary. Landis never could see the need of one. I even had trouble persuading him to hire enough stenographers. He wasn’t tight — he just couldn’t see the need of them. But I insisted on the secretary idea. I needed one; it wasn’t a question of style; so Brentwood came in with me from the main office.\n\nYou know what he looked like recently. Then he was only about 25, and he was handsome. He had played football at college — fenced, too, I believe. He showed the results of both in his size and manner. He was one of those men who look like statues or models for clothes advertisements. I believe that was one reason I took him. I didn’t go to college myself. Didn’t have time — had to make money.\n\nBrentwood was always well-dressed. He wasn’t making much, but I believe he had a small income from some money an aunt had left him. Besides that I hadn’t heard then of any vices he had. Of course, he took a drink now and then and he smoked, but no one ever called him a spendthrift.\n\nHe had a social position — I didn’t — and he went places then I couldn’t get in. I never wanted to. Don’t get the idea I was jealous about that.\n\nI got everything in the world I wanted, even if I did have to pay for them. I wanted money, because money was power and power was my dream. I have both. At least I had them until last night.\n\nWhatever had made me bring Brentwood into my office as private secretary, he justified my choice before he had been with me a week. He started right in taking minor details off my hands. I had more time for getting some of my big plans straightened out.\n\nBut the size of my plans didn’t help me any. Landis was a fool. If we made six per cent he was satisfied. If we made eight he thought we were beginning to speculate, and if we made ten, which happened as often as he let me have my way, he thought it was illegal. I wonder what the old man would say if he had lived until now.\n\nI wasn’t going to be tied down to a rock like that, and by the time Brentwood had been with me a year I had too much time on my hands to stand it any longer. Then I hit on the scheme.\n\nI would have preferred to do it with Landis. He had been good to me, but what I had in mind I couldn’t even talk to him about. He would have fixed it so I couldn’t get in with anyone else. I needed his money and other things he had. They made the thing possible so I went after someone else.\n\nEven though Landis wouldn’t listen, other firms had been getting a line on me. Whenever the firm put over anything big they all I knew I did it.\n\nYou remember Old Tom King. Crooked as a snake, but he knew how to make money. I had met him at lunch once or twice, but he had kept track of me, I knew, from things he said. He never ate anything but crackers and milk. He saw me order the same one day, so he took more interest in me. I thought he would.\n\nWhen I decided it was time to put over my scheme, I picked out King for the second man. It took two of us. I knew he would be the best I could find and he would be willing to do it, too. But I had to tie him up some way. I had made up my mind that I would double-cross Landis if I had to, but I was going to protect myself.\n\nI went to King’s house one night and told him my plan. Not all of it, just enough for him to see that it would work if properly handled. He wanted to know everything, but I wouldn’t tell him unless he consented to sign an agreement to put the thing through.\n\nThat agreement was a risky thing, because what we were going to do would put us both in jail, if we were found out. He objected to putting his name to anything, but I convinced him of the big possibilities, and he said he would sign.\n\nYou couldn’t take a single chance with King, so I went to my office that night to get the agreement ready. I knew how to use the typewriter, so I wrote it out. I made a carbon copy for myself.\n\nIt was not eight o’clock the next morning when I reached my office. I was so anxious to get the deal started and through with I hadn’t slept any, and I wanted to be down where things were going to happen. I was surprised to hear the typewriter clicking when I let myself in, and there was Brentwood. I wondered what had brought him down so early, and he offered a pile of letters as a reason, so I felt satisfied.\n\nBy nine o’clock King had signed the agreement, and when the market opened we started to work. You remember when C &amp;amp; Q broke about 50 points. King and I made a fortune, but it broke Landis. He lost his head when he saw the market slipping, because most of his money had been tied up in C &amp;amp; Q. He tried to hold it up, but we had our plans worked out too well. We sold short and I delivered Landis’s stock until we could cover. We did all right.\n\nLandis lost his nerve with his money and shot himself. I was sorry, because I had liked him and he had a wife and a boy. But he had no business in the game anyway. I was glad he hadn’t connected me with the break. No one else did either.\n\nAbout six months after Landis was dead I took over the business as Barnes and Company.\n\nI saved a little money out of the wreck for Mrs. Landis and she was comfortable. She was a fine woman and my little girl Lucia played and went to dancing school with her boy.\n\nEverything started out fine for me. Landis’s conservative reputation helped me out then on account of the time we had been together and I had plenty of money to back up anything I started. I had every chance in the world.\n\nThen this hound Brentwood began. I had put him in charge of one of the departments in the new firm and he was making good. He had been there about three months when he came up to my house one night.\n\nHe had been there before, at formal dinners once or twice when my wife had thought it necessary to entertain, but there had never been any friendship between us.\n\nThis night he asked for me and came into the library. I was feeling pretty good. I had put over a fair-sized deal that day and dinner had been comfortable. We didn’t have any guests.\n\nI was surprised at the visit, but I didn’t let on. I offered him a drink and a cigar. He refused the cigar and lighted one of his own cigarettes. Always had ’em made for him, he told me. He didn’t waste any remarks about the weather or my health.\n\n“When are you thinking of increasing the firm, Mr. Barnes?” he began.\n\nThat surprised me. Nothing I had ever said to him had indicated any intention of taking in any partners. I didn’t need any. All I needed was money and room. I had had two partners and I didn’t want any more. Landis was dead and King, too, had died about a month before. Apoplexy, I believe.\n\nAt first I started to bawl him out, but I thought better of it. Maybe he was trying to lead up to some idea with a joke. I had been with Landis too long and saw how much a man could lose by not listening to ideas.\n\n“Do you want to buy in?” I asked him. If he did have any scheme I was ready to listen to it in the hope it was worth while.\n\nHe seemed to be surprised. He knew I had a temper. He had been in my office for a year. I guess he was all set for a fight right away. But he smiled and went on:\n\n“Not buy exactly, but I think it can be arranged to suit us both.”\n\n“Like hell, you do!” I yelled.\n\nI was more than surprised. I thought he must have gone crazy, but I didn’t like his smile. He didn’t say anything, just sat there and smiled at me.\n\nHe didn’t look like a crazy man, and I began to wonder. All the time he had been with me he had been perfectly sane and he had never tried to joke. He was efficient and always on the job. What had happened to make him start out like he had was a mystery to me.\n\n“What do you mean? Have you been drinking or dreaming?” I tried to keep myself in hand, because at the back of my brain something had started to stir. Men with brains don’t usually have crazy schemes, and I knew he hadn’t been drinking and he wasn’t the sort to dream without something to base it on.\n\nI began to think of reasons for him getting up the nerve to say what he did.\n\nIt took nerve and something else. I had never let him in on anything, and outside of the deal with King there hadn’t been anything that could really cause trouble. And that King deal was safe. I had written the only papers in the thing myself. After the deal was over King and I had taken care to burn them.\n\nBut he had to have some reason, and I was losing my temper again. All the while he just sat.\n\n“Listen, Brentwood,” I told him then, “I don’t know what you are talking about, but the only satisfactory arrangement you can reach with me is to be ready to find another job by the first of the month. You are leaving us then.”\n\n“I am afraid you are wrong, Mr. Barnes,” and he reached into his pocket. He brought out a leather case and from it he took something and unfolded it very carefully.\n\nI couldn’t make out what it was at first. It was black, about the size of a letter sheet, then I saw it was a piece of carbon paper.\n\nEven then I didn’t get on right away. “Did you ever see this before?” and he held it up for me to see.\n\nThe marks of the typewriter stood out. I couldn’t read them but I knew what it was. I remembered the morning of my deal with King and Brentwood being down at the office early. When I wrote the agreement with King I forgot all about the carbon paper. I really didn’t realize until then that the carbon would carry any record. I must have just dumped it into the wastebasket when I finished.\n\nBrentwood was watching me, and he must have known what I was thinking.\n\n“What is it anyway?” and I tried to keep my voice what it had been before. But I was beginning to get nervous. I had been learning things about Brentwood ever since he began the conversation.\n\n“Do you want me to read it to you, Mr. Barnes?”\n\nAs he asked the question he smiled again. I had stood all of that smile I was going to. It must have made me lose my head. I couldn’t take a chance on that thing coming out with Landis not yet dead a year. I had to have that piece of carbon.\n\nHe sidestepped me as I rushed and grabbed me from behind. I told you he bad played football.\n\n“There is no need for excitement, Barnes,” he dropped the “Mr.” then. “You can’t get this away from me without killing me. You had better listen to reason.”\n\nI saw I couldn’t manhandle him. I never have been a strong man, and his grip on my wrists was like iron.\n\n“Well, say what you’ve got to say,” I managed to control my temper long enough to get it out.\n\n“Suppose we outline a few possibilities first,” he began. “There isn’t a chance of convicting you of anything by this piece of carbon paper by itself. The district attorney couldn’t use it as evidence without something to back it up. But what happened to\nC &amp;amp; Q about nine months ago everyone knows.\n\nThis little piece of paper tells what was going to happen before it ever did. It also mentions the matter of Landis’s stock. Old King may be dead, but he still has a grip on you.\n\n“I don’t want to take this to the district attorney. I wouldn’t have to, as far as that goes. Public opinion would be enough, if I made this public. It would be an unpleasant scandal and it might be hard for me to get located profitably after having been so intimately connected with you.\n\nBesides there isn’t anything one-tenth so good as what you can give me. For a twenty per cent interest in the firm I will tuck this little piece of paper away in a safe deposit vault and the world will move merrily on.”\n\nHe had turned me loose and we were sitting facing each other. I believe then was the first time I had ever had a good look at his eyes. They were close together and there was a kind of murky green fire playing around way down deep. His whole face was different.\n\nThere wasn’t anything to it. I argued with him about how the district attorney would laugh at his romantic idea of using a piece of carbon paper, but he had me scared and he knew it. Then I agreed to his plan with an amendment that he burn the paper.\n\nHe laughed then, and it was a long way from a chuckle. He must be laughing like that now, knowing what is going to happen to me.\n\n“Burn it, and let you get me like you did Landis,” he wanted to know. “I know you, Barnes, and there is nothing you wouldn’t do to make money. My proposition is made and it goes. You can take it or leave it.”\n\nI took another look at that face, and I agreed. He smiled then and drew out a little pile of papers from his pocket.\n\nOne was articles of agreement for the partnership, providing for the change of the firm name. The others were notices for the papers of the change. I signed them all and then I wondered how he had happened to look for the carbon. I hated to ask him, but I had to know.\n\n“You have a bad habit of leaving things around,” he told me when I did ask. “Besides that I have been with you long enough to see your crooked brain work. I saw you make a play at Old King one day at lunch. You remember, the day you had crackers and milk. I knew you usually had roast beef and all the vegetables you could find on the menu, finishing up with pie.\n\n“I saw you meet him other times, and I knew that you were discussing trouble for someone.\n\n“You may not remember, but I helped you check over the securities in the Landis safe deposit box one day. Then I began to watch you. I knew something was coming, and that you would make a fortune. I wasn’t going to be left out.\n\n“The night before you went up to King’s house you did a little figuring on your scheme. You burned some of the papers, I found the ashes, but you must have crumpled up one of them without thinking about it. I don’t mind telling you I found it in your wastebasket. I had discovered a search of that basket every night was usually worth while.\n\n“I heard you call Mrs. Barnes and tell her you were not coming home for dinner, and I followed you until I saw you safely in King’s house.\n\n“When I came down next morning I met the night watchman leaving and he remarked that you must be trying to check me up, because you had been down to the office the night before using the typewriter. You see I had a pretty clear trail.”\n\nThe cigar I smoked that night was the last comfortable one I have had until this. There hasn’t been a moment, until last night, that I haven’t thought about that piece of carbon paper. And don’t think Brentwood let me forget about it either.\n\nHe didn’t mention it for a year. Then he came in and remarked that he thought he was growing more valuable as a member of the firm. I wasn’t quite cowed then and I let myself go for a minute, but he brought me up sharp. Oh, he had me, all right. I agreed.\n\nThe next time came about two years later. He asked me up to his apartment to dinner that night. I went, and he asked for another five per cent. There wasn’t any argument at all.\n\nDon’t think that Brentwood wasn’t making good. He had a genius for finance. He never had a scheme that failed. Of course, we didn’t make millions out of everything he brought up, but we never lost and he worked hard.\n\nMy dinner engagements with him came about every two years, which brought us up to six months ago. I never had anything to do with him outside of the office except at dinners at my house, formal dinners, when he was just one of the guests.\n\nEach time I went to his place he had a five per cent larger interest in the firm. The last time left him with a full half.\n\nI had begun to take it for granted. I knew that every two years I would have to eat all alone with him and listen to his rotten talk about women. He was a cad, and he knew I hated his stories. That’s the reason he told them.\n\nThen after dinner he would make his same smiling demand and there was nothing for me to do.\n\nDid I tell you that I hadn’t had a peaceful moment since he showed me that paper? I couldn’t tell my wife about it. She is a wonderful woman. She doesn’t even suspect that I was mixed up in the Landis affair.\n\nYou are the first human being I have been able to tell this thing to after fifteen years of living it. Fifteen years is a long time. I don’t want your sympathy. It’s all over now and I want to get it off my mind.\n\nBut that doesn’t make any difference about my shooting Brentwood. As I said, he called on me last about six months ago. I thought then that I would have two more years of almost peace, when something else came up.\n\nYou may have seen a picture of my daughter Lucia. It was published last winter when she made her debut. She is her mother all over again, and I am just “daddy” to her.\n\nShe has always been my pal, since she was a little girl. And she is now, too.\n\nAnyway, she made her debut last winter, and Brentwood started coming to the house more frequently. I would come home in the afternoon and find him at tea. My wife asked him to dinner two or three times, just with the family. She had never seen him ask for a larger share of the firm.\n\nIt kept up so that I began to have a big fear, bigger than my fear of Brentwood and his carbon paper. Suppose my girl should fall in love with him.\n\nA couple of nights ago by some chance she was staying at home. She came into the library where I was trying to read, and I decided to try to find out how much she liked Brentwood.\n\nShe came over and sat on the arm of my chair and pulled my hair.\n\n“Where is Brentwood tonight?” I started to question her.\n\n“Pining away in some dark den, probably. I refused to let him come up. I told him it was daddy’s night.”\n\nI patted her hand, but still that didn’t mean anything.\n\n“It seems to me he is coming around pretty frequently these days.”\n\n“You are not the only one who thinks so,” and she blushed.\n\nFathers may be stupid, but I knew my daughter and there was a great load gone off my mind.\n\n“Who is he?” I tried to be very stern.\n\nThen she slipped down into my lap and told me it was young Landis. The boy had more push than his father and was a comer. I liked him. They had decided that he was to come to see me the next day, and she had stayed at home to tell me about it. Her mother had already given her approval.\n\nYoung Landis came to see me yesterday. I liked the way he talked and I told him I was glad that Lucia had chosen him. When he left I felt so good I told Brentwood about it. I had to tell someone, because it meant so much to have my girl happy. He said that Landis was to be congratulated and left it at that.\n\nHis manner meant nothing to me, and I had about decided to give myself a half holiday, when he came into my office and invited me to dinner that night. He saw I was happy and he wasn’t going to let me be. He knew I wouldn’t refuse to go.\n\nI went.\n\nEverybody knows that now. He was just the same at dinner as ever. The same boasting of his amours. I managed to live through it, because all the time my mind was busy wondering whether I could argue him out of asking for a larger share of the firm right at present. I wanted to give Lucia and Landis a start and I had to get all the returns I could get to do it properly.\n\nBut it wasn’t money he was after.\n\n“I am not going to keep you in suspense, Barnes,” Brentwood began. “The reason I invited you up here immediately was to prevent you making the mistake you did this morning. It will never do for you to announce Lucia’s engagement to too many people. They might not understand it later.”\n\n“Understand what?” I demanded. I didn’t need an answer. I knew what he meant, but I had to have him say it.\n\n“Because, Barnes, you will have to arrange for her to marry me.”\n\nI didn’t argue.\n\nI shot him.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Carbon Paper\n\nBarnes finished his story as the train was crashing over the switches of the Grand Central. When they reached the station, the banker reached out his wrists for the handcuffs, but Thorne apparently didn’t see the movement, as he led the way out.\n\nAfter Thorne had deposited his prisoner at the Tombs, his one thought was the piece of carbon paper in Brentwood’s safe deposit box.

A voice piped shrilly: “Pat—Pat, wait!”\n\nThere was excitement in the call. A touch of hysteria. I turned and saw a kid slamming toward me through the dusk, a kid of fourteen or fifteen. He wore dirty corduroy slacks, a baggy grey sweater and scuffed shoes. His sandy hair needed combing, and when he came closer I noticed streaks on his grimy face. As if he’d been crying.\n\nIt wasn’t like Lester Harcourt to cry. At least I had never seen him do it, and I’d known him a long time.\n\nHis pals didn’t call him Lester, they called him Butch or got punched in the jaw. He was that kind. A pretty tough little monkey.\n\nHe didn’t look tough now, though. He grabbed at my arm, and I thought I saw panic in his eyes.\n\n“Pat!” he gulped. “Pat—” He gulped again.\n\nI wasn’t interested in his panic. I wasn’t interested in anybody named Harcourt, period. He should have known that. There are some things you just don’t get over, and what his sister had done to me was one of them.\n\n“Scram, punk,” I said.\n\nHe wouldn’t let go of my sleeve. “Pat, gee, listen!”\n\n“Scram, I told you.” I didn’t like to look at his eyes. They were blue, like Barbara’s. They reminded me of her. Too much. And I didn’t want to be reminded of Barbara. I’d been more than two long years trying to forget her. And failing.\n\n“Pat, you got to listen,” he said. That was the trouble with him. Persistent. Maybe because he liked me. Some kids are that way about cops. Hero-worship stuff. He choked: “It’s pop.”\n\n“What about him?”\n\n“He’s d-dead, Pat.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Kid Had Really Told The Truth\n\nThat stopped me cold. I’d never had anything against old Aaron Harcourt. He was a nice enough guy, as music teachers go. A little impractical, maybe. But he’d managed to bring up his two motherless kids on what he earned giving violin lessons. You had to respect him for that.\n\nI looked at Lester. “How’d it happen? Heart?”\n\n“He … he was murdered, Pat.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“It’s true, Pat. I found him on the floor when I got home off my paper route just now. There’s blood on his head, and—and—”\n\nI started walking. Fast. Not toward my apartment house just a few doors down the street, but the other way. The kid kept pace with me. I said: “Did you phone a doctor?”\n\n“No. What good’s a doctor? He’s dead, Pat. I … felt him. His pulse, I mean. Then I came after you. I knew you’d be coming home from headquarters about now, and … you being a detective sergeant and all, I … I thought…\n\n“Okay, okay,” I said. Then as we reached the corner: “What about your sister? Wasn’t she home?”\n\n“No. I guess she already left for Moon Garden. She works out there now. Singing with Al Carlin’s orc.”\n\n“Yeah, so I heard.”\n\n“I wish she’d married you instead of Rudy.”\n\nI stopped at the far curb.\n\n“Lay off, punk.”\n\nI didn’t even want to hear Rudy Ferranti’s name mentioned.\n\n“Now shut up and come on. Quit needling me.”\n\nWe turned the corner and headed for his house, a shabby little cottage on a seedy lot in the middle of the block. I still couldn’t bring myself to believe his old man had been murdered. Nobody would have any motive for killing an inoffensive violin teacher. The kid had been reading too many detective stories. Or maybe this was his idea of a practical joke.\n\nI walked into the bungalow’s living room and saw Aaron Harcourt’s body sprawled on the floor, face down, the back of his head crushed in from a series of blows. Harcourt was all through giving music lessons. The kid had really told the truth.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Terrific Struggle\n\nI went through the motions of putting my finger on the artery in his neck. I knew there’d be no pulse-beats. He was still warm, though. He hadn’t been dead too long. I crossed the room, picked up the phone, and called headquarters. “Pat Whitney talking,” I said. I reported the kill, gave the address, and was told to sit tight; the homicide boys would be right over with a tech squad. I rang off. Then I looked around.\n\nEven as upset as it was, the room was familiar. I remembered all the times I’d been in it in the old days, starting away back when we were all kids in grammar school: Barbara, the skinny, leggy tomboy. Al Carlin the studious one, wanting to be a musician. Me with my mind set on a blue-serge uniform and a badge. And Ferranti the flashy, wiry hellion who swiped oranges and bananas from his father’s fruit stand—and shared his loot with the rest of us. Whatever deviltry we got into, Ferranti was usually the one who started it.\n\nI remembered another day I had come here, my first day as a probationary patrolman, showing off my shiny new shield, full of pride because I was finally on the force, a rookie cop. Strutting to make an impression on Barbara, who was no longer a leggy tomboy.\n\nI remembered how beautiful she had been that day, remembered how bright her eyes had been, remembered the soft golden sheen of her hair. That was the week Al Carlin got his first professional job with an orchestra. And it was the week Rudy Ferranti had come around flashing a thick roll of bills he’d won in a crap game. Almost a thousand dollars. Maybe I sensed, even then, what he would do to me later. What he and Barbara would do to me.\n\nThis very living room was where I’d asked Barbara to marry me. It was where she had said yes and held out her finger for the ring that had cost me two months’ pay. And it was where her father had told me, just a day before the scheduled wedding, that she’d eloped with Rudy Ferranti instead.\n\nSo now I was back again. And Barbara’s father was dead in a room that had been torn apart as if by a cyclone. The old man must have put up a terrific struggle before his killer battered him down. The worn rug was bunched, a rocking chair overturned. There was sheet music scattered all over. Ornaments and pictures had been knocked off a desk in a far corner. The place was a shambles.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nA Genuine Enamieri\n\nI picked up a double cabinet photoholder in a hinged leather frame. The girl was Barbara in her white graduation gown, her first formal. The tall, studious-looking kid with the glasses was Al Carlin. The wiry, swarthy one was Ferranti. The big hulking guy with the lantern jaw and stupid expression was me.\n\nI hurled it across the room. It landed near an open violin case that stuck out from under a window drape. The violin case caught my eye. It was a special kind, foreign-made and pretty old. I recognized it and turned to the Harcourt kid, who’d been watching me and not saying anything.\n\n“Where’s the fiddle that belongs in this?” I asked him.\n\nHis eyes widened. “Gosh, it’s gone, isn’t it?”\n\n“Seems to be. Take a look around.”\n\nHe prowled the room, then the rest of the house. He came back pretty quick. “I can’t find it, Pat. The one he gave lessons with, that’s in the hall closet. But this one—” He screwed up his face. “Any time pop took it out to play it, he always put it back in the case.”\n\nI remembered the violin Aaron Harcourt had kept in this special case: an instrument he’d never allowed even his own kids to touch. Now and then, on some particular occasion, he would play it himself—but only rarely, and then to the accompaniment of a lecture as to its history.\n\n“A genuine Enamieri,” he would tell you dreamily. “A real one. Listen to the singing tone. The mellowness. The warmth. Andrea Enamieri, he was one of the great violin makers of Cremona. A pupil of the master Nicolo Amati.\n\n“Yes, Enamieri and the more famous Antonio Stradavari were fellow-students. Together they learned their art. Today the public knows a good deal about Strad violins, but very little about Enamieri instruments. A pity, too, because in my opinion Enamieri was the better artisan.”\n\nHe would look at you, waiting for you to say that this fiddle of his must be mighty valuable. Then he would sadly shake his head.\n\n“Valuable to me, yes. But to professional collectors, no. Because the Enamieri signature is not inside.” He would hold it up so you could look through the f-shaped holes on each side of the bridge.\n\n“Some time in its career it must have had an accident. The original back, with the signature on the inner surface, must have been splintered. It was replaced with this strip of lighter-colored wood. An excellent repair job, you understand. The tone is unimpaired.\n\n“But that Enamieri signature would have made the difference between a violin worth perhaps a hundred thousand dollars and a concert fiddle you could buy for a thousand. If I were willing to sell for that price. Which I am not.”\n\nLester blinked at me. “Pat, you think somebody murdered pop for that fiddle?”\n\n“It’s a theory.”\n\nThe kid’s lower lip trembled. “Pat, I got to tell you this. I don’t want you to think I’m a stool, but—well, I got to tell you. Promise you won’t think that I’m just a blabbermouth, Pat?”\n\n“What do you care what I think?”\n\n“Aw, Pat,” he said. His voice wasn’t steady. “Don’t hold it against me because sis married that Ferranti guy. It wasn’t my fault she was a damned fool.”\n\n“Lay off,” I snapped. “I told you I didn’t want you to mention him to me. I meant it.”\n\n“Sure, Pat, okay. Only—well, I wish you wouldn’t be sore at me for something sis did.”\n\n“I’m not. I’m not sore at anybody.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nOut Of Its Case\n\nHe knew better, of course. He knew I was lying when I said I wasn’t sore. Kids are smarter than you give them credit for. He knew it was eating my heart out because Barbara had married Ferranti. He just didn’t know how to put his sympathy into words.\n\n“Pat, look,” he said. “I got to mention Rudy to you. Just this once. And I’m not ratting. Only after all, it’s my pop that’s been killed. That makes it different.”\n\n“What are you trying to tell me?”\n\n“Well, things ain’t been going so good with sis and Rudy. All that talk of his about being in the chips, that was a lot of baloney. That was why he and sis came back here to live with Pop and me a couple of months ago. He was busted. Every cent he got his hands on, he dropped it on the ponies. Or dice.”\n\nHe scraped the worn rug with the scuffed toe of his shoe.\n\n“Rudy wanted pop to sell that fiddle and lend him the money he’d get out of it. He kept telling pop he could take the dough and run it into a real bankroll in a hot crap game he knew about. Pop wouldn’t do it, though. You remember how pop was.”\n\nThe kid’s voice choked a little and his eyes went to his old man’s body. “Maybe he would have for sis, but not for Rudy. So he kept saying no. Rudy got pretty sore a couple times. He got nasty.”\n\n“How nasty?”\n\n“Loud-talk nasty. Then sis went to see Al Carlin and landed a job singing with his band, out at Moon Garden. She said if Rudy wouldn’t work and earn her a living, it looked like she’d have to do it herself. Rudy didn’t like that too much. He spends most of his time out there watching to see that nobody don’t make no passes at her. He blamed it all on pop because he wouldn’t sell that violin. And now it’s gone.\n\n“I’m just telling you what I know.” He was tough again but it was only a cover-up. His lower lip was still trembling. “You make the guesses. You’re the copper.”\n\n“All right,” I said. “I’ll make the guesses.”\n\nTo start with, not too many people had known about old Harcourt’s Enamieri. That narrowed the field down to his few intimate friends—and his immediate family.\n\nIn the second place, an ordinary thief wouldn’t steal the violin out of its case, he’d take the whole works. But an insider might leave the case behind, closed and latched, hoping the theft wouldn’t be discovered right away. Figuring it wouldn’t come to light until the next time Harcourt went to take the fiddle out and play it.\n\nOkay. Now suppose the old man walked in, caught the guy taking the instrument from its plush-lined container, recognized him and jumped him. And got killed doing it.\n\nIt all meshed with what Lester Harcourt said about Rudy Ferranti. I went over to the phone, picked up the directory, leafed through it, located the number of the Moon Garden dance joint, and made the call.\n\n“Al Carlin,” I said.\n\nPresently Carlin came on the line, his voice modulated and studious as ever. I told him it was Pat Whitney calling and he sounded glad to hear from me. Glad, and a little surprised. I congratulated him on having a dance band of his own and said: “Is Ferranti out there, Al?”\n\nHe chuckled. “He’s always here when Barbara’s on the job. You want to talk to him?”\n\n“Not on the phone,” I said. “In person. Be seeing you.”\n\nI rang off and said to Lester: “I’m going to pick up a taxi and go after him. You stay here until the homicide boys come. Tell them where I went.”\n\nI went as far as the door. Then I said over my shoulder: “When the guys from headquarters get here, better tell them I want a squad car sent after me.”\n\n“Okay, Pat.” His voice was sullen.\n\n“And you can come along if they’ll bring you,” I added. After all, it was only natural he’d want to be around when his father’s killer was nabbed.\n\nHe turned then. “Thanks, Pat,” he said.\n\nHis eyes still reminded me of his sister’s. I went out of the house and didn’t look back.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nWhere’d You Get The Fiddle?\n\nMoon Garden was on the edge of town, just inside the city limits but a good mile beyond where the subdivision housing developments stopped. It was a rambling, ramshackle eyesore that masked its shabbiness with neon signs, including a big pale neon moon over the flat roof. The only thing that put it a cut above a juke joint was Al Carlin’s eight-piece orchestra.\n\nI could hear the band braying something brassy as I headed toward the entrance. After two years I was going to see Barbara again. And I was going to put handcuffs on the guy who had taken her away from me. I was going to arrest him. For murder.\n\nIt was going to hit Barbara hard, learning her old man had been killed. It would hurt worse, knowing her husband had done it. Knowing she was married to a murderer. She must have loved him or she wouldn’t have eloped with him.\n\nNow she was going to lose him to the electric chair. Well, that was her tough luck. She wouldn’t get any sympathy out of me. In a little while she would find out what it meant to have your dreams smashed.\n\nI went inside. The place smelled like a pesthole. Tobacco smoke and the reek of stale beer eddied in the dim purple light, with brighter lights centering on the bandstand at the far end of the long narrow room. Along one side was a bar. The other side had booths and tables. All occupied.\n\nA lot of teenagers were cutting up on the dance floor to the savage rhythm of Al Carlin’s crew.\n\nCarlin stood downstage front, facing the orchestra, his back to the dancers. He gave the tempo and fiddled at the same time. Now and then he used his violin bow as a baton.\n\nHe looked tall and tailored in his tux, and presently when the number was over he turned and gave the clapping crowd a nice studious smile, his glasses reflecting the colored footlights and his violin held in front of him, the bridge side turned in to his lean middle.\n\nThe back of the instrument was smooth dark wood— except for a blond streak in the center. An insert strip the color of honey. The color of Barbara’s hair.\n\nI felt a sudden tightness in my throat. Then I shoved forward and found the door that led backstage. I came to the wings of the bandstand. I said loudly: “Al.”\n\nCarlin glanced my way, saw me and came to me. “You got out here pretty fast, Pat. Still looking for Rudy?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I said. My voice didn’t sound like mine. My finger shook when I pointed with it. “Where’d you get that fiddle, Al?”\n\n“This?” He twirled it. “Why? Do you recognize it? You ought to. It was Pop Harcourt’s.”\n\n“I didn’t ask you that. I asked you where you got it.”\n\nHe frowned a little. He didn’t seem to like my tone of voice. “Is that you talking, Pat? Or is it your badge?”\n\n“Just answer my question,” I said. “Where’d you get the fiddle? Tell me and tell me quick.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nI Believe You\n\nHe lifted a shoulder. “I bought it. From Rudy. He finally talked old man Harcourt into selling it.”\n\n“Is that what he told you?”\n\n“Sure. I gave him three hundred for it. Three one-hundred-dollar bills. Why?”\n\nThen his eyes narrowed behind the glasses. “Hey, wait a minute, Pat. Are you trying to tell me there was something phony about the deal?”\n\n“Something very phony,” I said. “Where can I find Ferranti?” Suddenly I felt tired, knowing what was ahead of me, knowing what I had to do.\n\n“In Barbara’s dressing room. It’s intermission time right now, and he’ll be in there with her.”\n\n“Show me the way,” I said.\n\nHe led me along a narrow hallway that needed ventilating. We came to a closed door and I shoved him aside. I opened the door without knocking first.\n\nBarbara was sitting in front of her dressing table, touching up her makeup. Her hair was the color of honey and her face was the wistful little-girl face that had been haunting me these past two years.\n\nA trifle more mature, maybe. And there were tired lines around her eyes, I thought. But aside from that she’d hardly changed at all.\n\nNeither had Ferranti. Those swarthy, wiry ones never change. I saw him turn around, fast, and stare at me as I came in.\n\nFerranti said: “Whitney!” and Barbara said: “Pat!” and I waved them both quiet. They looked at me. Barbara steadily and Rudy shiftily.\n\nI said: “Your dad’s dead, Babs.”\n\nHer makeup was suddenly splotchy against cheeks that had gone white. “Pat—”\n\n“He was murdered,” I said.\n\nShe started to get up off the bench in front of the dressing table but didn’t quite make it. She sank down again. She was trying to say something, but no words came.\n\nHe was killed for his violin,” I said. I wasn’t enjoying this. Maybe I should have enjoyed it, but I didn’t. I said:\n\n“What would you think if I told you your husband killed him?”\n\nRudy jumped at me. He was fast on his feet. He always had been. He was fast with his tongue, too. He called me a name.\n\nI sidestepped him and hit him in the belly. He gasped and went backward. He wouldn’t try that again for a while. I raised my voice and said: “Al, come in here.”\n\nCarlin walked into the dressing room. He had the Enamieri in his hands. He went past me and shoved the instrument at Ferranti, “Take this and give me my money back, you creep.”\n\n“I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about,” Rudy said. He wouldn’t touch the violin.\n\n“What money? Where the hell did you get that fiddle?”\n\n“You know where I got it. You sold it to me.”\n\n“That’s a lie!” Rudy yelled.\n\n“I paid you three hundred-dollar bills.” Carlin looked at me. “Why don’t you search him, Pat?”\n\nI did just that. I found the three bills in the side pocket of Ferranti’s coat.\n\nFerranti said: “It’s a frame, a lousy stinking frame. I don’t know anything about—”\n\nThe denial seemed to choke him. He scuttled to Barbara.\n\n“Don’t let them do this to me, hon. They’re railroading me. Hon, I didn’t bump your old man. I don’t know anything about it. I swear I don’t.”\n\n“I believe you,” she said.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nTo Pinch Rudy\n\nSo she believed him. But that wouldn’t keep him out of the electric chair.\n\nThere was something else I was thinking about, something even bigger. Maybe when Barbara was a widow I might have another chance.\n\nIn time maybe I could mend some of those dreams she’d smashed for me when she married Rudy Ferranti. I got out my handcuffs. The guy cringed.\n\nAnd Barbara looked at him again the way she had never looked at me. It was something protective, something you couldn’t put into words. She knew him for what he was.\n\nYellow.\n\nA loud-mouth.\n\nA cheap flash.\n\nThat was why she married him.\n\nIt was why she’d stick to him no matter what happened. Because he needed her. It had taken me a long time, but now I knew.\n\nAnd I knew I wouldn’t send him to the chair. I could, and I’d love it. But I wouldn’t.\n\nBecause I realized he wasn’t guilty. I’d realized this for quite a while. I turned, took the Enamieri away from Al Carlin and snapped the handcuffs on him.\n\nAl choked and stiffened and rattled the cuffs. His eyes were hot and angry behind the glasses he wore.\n\n“What the hell is this, Pat, a gag? I didn’t kill pop—”\n\n“Yes, you did,” I said. “And it was the fiddle that tripped you.”\n\n“Now wait, Pat.”\n\n“Look,” I said. “You’re one of the few who knew pop owned an Enamieri. I think you were the thief he caught stealing it.”\n\n“You’re nuts. I’m making plenty of money. Why should I steal a fiddle I could afford to buy? Besides, the kind of music I play these days, I don’t need an expensive violin.”\n\n“I thought of that,” I said. “But you used to be in love with Barbara, same as I was. And you hated the idea of her being hooked to a louse like Rudy. I think you stole the Enamieri to plant it on Rudy, so he’d be accused. So Barbara would be disgusted with him and maybe divorce him.”\n\nI was guessing, of course. But I must have been pretty close to the mark. Carlin’s expression told me that.\n\nI said: “But pop caught you in the act. You had to kill him. So then I think you decided your original scheme would still work. Only better. Now you could frame Rudy for murder as well as theft. All you had to do was to slip three bills in the side pocket of his coat—where, incidentally, a guy never carries that kind of money loose. And then deliberately show off the Enamieri where I’d see it and recognize it. You’d say Rudy sold it to you, and you would have him nailed to the cross.”\n\n“He did sell it to me.”\n\nI said: “No, you slipped up on your logic there, Al. Whatever else Rudy may be, he’s smart. If he had murdered pop while stealing the violin, he would have ditched it. The dumbest killer in the world would have brains enough to realize that the fiddle was the one thing that would link him to the murder. His first instinct would be to get rid of it. Selling it to you was the one thing Rudy wouldn’t have done. He’d be putting himself in the electric chair for a lousy three hundred dollars. It wasn’t plausible. You were trying to frame him. I saw that right away.”\n\n“Can you make it stick?” he asked me. Not blustering. He really wanted to know.\n\nI told him I thought I could. And I meant it.\n\n“All right,” he said. “I’ll take a plea.”\n\nHe wouldn’t look at Barbara and Rudy when he said it. But I did. For the first time in two years I could look at them without hate.\n\n“Better start for home, you two,” I said. I was thinking there would be funeral arrangements to make. Details to be taken care of. “And—I’m sorry about pop.”\n\nBarbara said softly: “Thanks, Pat.” Just the two words. But they covered a lot of things. She and her husband went out.\n\nPresently a squad car of homicide guys came to take Al Carlin off my hands. They brought Lester Harcourt with them.\n\nAfter they took Al away he said: “But, Pat, I … I thought you were going to pinch Rudy.”\n\n“I almost did. I almost made that mistake.” He would never know how big a mistake I had come near making.\n\n“But, Pat—”\n\n“Skip it, Butch.” He got it. I’d called him Butch.\n\nI put my arm around his shoulder. “Come on, Butch. I’ll take you home.”\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

A lot of people have been asking questions,\njust because I happen to know a couple of the guys that run it. I know\nhow the whole thing started, and to prove I am not involved in any way\nI’ll tell it just the way they told it to me.\n\nThese guys—Benny Swartz and Herbie Peters—get an idea Chicago could do\nwith a little more law and order.\n\nThey have pretty good reasons for thinking that. They’re not back in\ntown two days when burglars rob police headquarters of $10,000. The next\nday some thief steals all the buns out of the police cafeteria. And\nright after that thugs snatch the Mayor’s limousine for a get-away car,\napparently after shooting down one of Buck Clancy’s smartest contact\nboys. Buck Clancy, as everybody in Chicago knows, is the undercover boss\nfor a lot of profitable rackets.\n\n“This,” says Benny firmly, “has gone far enough. It’s time something was\ndone about crooks disregarding the code this way!”\n\n“Which code?” asks Herbie.\n\n“The code for cops and robbers,” says Benny. “Chicago has long been an\noutstanding example for playing that game according to the rules. And it\nis strictly not according to Hoyle for crooks to pick on the police\ndepartment—even for a joke.”\n\n“I don’t think these guys were joking,” says Herbie. “But is it any of\nour business? We got problems of our own, figuring out what kind of work\nwe’re gonna do now that we’re civilians again. I don’t think Mr.\nMilligan is gonna pay our bills in this high class dump forever, even if\nhe is a millionaire, and Mug Milligan’s old man. Just because we’re pals\nof Mug’s is no reason why his old man should be willing to support all\nthree of us, and furthermore—”\n\n“You don’t get it,” says Benny, folding up the newspaper and slapping it\ndown on the breakfast tray. “It’s psy-“\n\n“Psychology?” Herbie wrinkles up his face and looks baffled. “Then I\nsure don’t get it. All I know is, Mr. Milligan says for us to get busy\nand figure out a project that all three of us can work on. You and me\nand Mug Milligan. In my book that means we got to start earnin’ our own\nliving right away. Not only you and me, but even his own son—”\n\n“Sure, sure,” says Benny, standing up and surveying himself in a\nmirrored door. He is a small, wiry guy with shrewd black eyes and a\nsharp nose. He is attired at the moment in black and yellow striped\npajamas and a bright cerise robe. He nods at himself like he is\nsatisfied and pulls a cigarette out of his pocket.\n\n“Psychology,” he says, “works in all directions. All you got to do is\ntake advantage of it, and you’re promotin’ a sure thing.”\n\n“Promotin’!” snorts Herbie, easing his big frame out of a delicate pink\nand gold chair. “You’re always promotin’. I may not be smart about\npsychology, but I got sense enough to know this: old Mr. Milligan didn’t\nget to be a millionaire by lettin’ other guys promote him for this and\nthat.”\n\n“Sure not,” agrees Benny. “He got what he wanted by lettin’ other guys\npromote what they wanted. It’s complicated, but just take our case for\nan example. We get acquainted with Mug Milligan out at that\nrehabilitation center in Arizona. That was no accident. The head doc\nrigged it up because he was worried about Mug Milligan. The surgeons\nhave patched up the burned places and given Mug an artificial foot, but\nhe is still full of depression, even if he has got a swell home and a\nmillionaire father in Chicago. So the doc looks around for somebody\nthat’s worse off than Mug in one way or another, and he picks on us.\nWhich is smart. We’re not in such bad shape physically as Mug is. All\nyou got is a bum leg from shell fragments;, and all I got is wheezy\nlungs from a chest wound. But we’re not depressed, even if we don’t have\nno homes to go back to, and not very good prospects of being able to\nhandle our pre-war jobs. Now do you begin to get it? That’s psychology.”\n\n“Yeah. Okay,” says Herbie, trying hard. “So that’s why you were handin’\nMug all that sob stuff about us bein’ happy to be goin’ back to Chicago\nand sittin’ on the corner of Randolph and Clark sellin’ apples. You even\nhad me believin’ it!”\n\n“Now you got it,” says Benny. “And it worked, too. Pretty soon Mug\nstarted worrying about us instead of his depression, and then he begun\nto figure maybe he better do something about it. So that’s how it\nhappens we were all shipped back to Chicago together. And that’s why\nMug’s father tells us to get busy right away on a project. Mug is\nsupposed to think he’s helping us earn our living, and we’re supposed to\nthink we got to work like hell to make good so Mug won’t lose interest\nand take away his father’s financial backing.”\n\n“Yeah. Okay,” says Herbie, looking somewhat enlightened. “Now all we got\nto do is figure out a project that’s suited to a former sales promoter,\na former truck driver, and a former millionaire playboy. That’s all we\ngot to do.”\n\n“Get dressed,” says Benny, sliding out of his brilliant robe and placing\nit carefully on a hanger. “We got a project. What Chicago needs most\nright now is more protection from crooks. We’re gonna open a modern\nbureau of crime prevention. All the latest up-to- date methods in the\ninvestigation and solution of illegal acts perpetrated against the\nperson, property and peace of mind of the citizens of Chicago.”\n\n“Oh,” says Herbie, stepping into the shower, “a detective agency.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Good Home-Grown Murder\n\nTen days later Benny is promoting a little publicity by feeding Bill\nFaris a deluxe lunch at the Palmer House. Bill is a reporter with the\nChicago Sun and he listens politely while demolishing a rare and costly\nsteak.\n\n“You got to admit it’s a wonderful set-up,” says Benny enthusiastically.\n“With President Matthew Milligan supplying the contacts for our socially\nprominent clientele, and Secretary Herbert Peters handling the strong\narm tactics, and myself, Treasurer Benjamin Swartz doing the brain work,\nthe GI Protective Bureau is bound to be a success.”\n\n“I don’t see how you can miss,” agrees Bill with his mouth full, “with\nold Patrick Milligan backing you.”\n\n“That,” says Benny, “is a minor detail. In fact, I’d be willing to lay\nyou ten to one that Mr. Milligan cleans up on his investment within a\nyear’s time. I’d like to have you meet my partners and take a look\naround our suite of offices. That’ll give you a better idea of the fine\ncontribution we are making to law and order in the City of Chicago.”\n\nThoroughly satisfied and somewhat mellowed, Bill Faris allows himself to\nbe conducted to the Field Building, where Benny proudly opens the door\nto a modernistic layout straight from Hollywood.\n\nThe reception room is bathed in a soft light from concealed fixtures.\nThe deep taupe carpet and twilight blue walls are accented with enlarged\npictures of scarlet poppies, and make a perfect background for the\ncurvaceous bleached blond furniture. But the curvaceous bleached blonde\nreceptionist ruins the picture.\n\nShe is lying on the taupe carpet beside her curved desk with an ugly\nbullet hole between her eyes, and scarlet streams outlining her\nfeatures.\n\nBenny stands there, paralyzed with shock, until Bill Faris shoves him\nout of the way and closes the door. He steps noiselessly across the\ncarpet and crouches to feel the blonde’s limp wrist. He puts it down\nquick and back away again, staring hard at Benny.\n\n“I didn’t expect anything like this,” says Benny weakly.\n\n“There is nothing,” says Bill Faris flatly, “like a good home-grown\nmurder to start off a new detective agency. Where are those fine\nsuccessful partners of yours?”\n\nBenny starts coming back to life and leads the way to the inner offices.\nThere is a carpeted hall with four private rooms opening off that. Three\ndoors are lettered with the names of the firm’s three officers. The\nfourth is the library and consultation room. All are brightly new and\nunoccupied.\n\n“That’s funny,” Benny mumbles. “I don’t know why they should go out,\nwhen they knew I was bringing you up here—”\n\n“It’s very unfunny,” says Bill, reaching for the phone. “As you are\nabout to find out!”\n\n“Hey! Wait a minute!” Benny moves quick and snatches the phone away.\n“What are you trying to do?”\n\n“Phone the police, you dizzy dope! This is murder!”\n\n“Sure, sure,” says Benny, talking fast. “It’s murder. And you discovered\nit. And you’re a reporter. Right? You got a scoop. You gonna give it\naway before we even find out any of the details? You gonna hand it to\nthe other papers, and let some smart boy on another sheet solve it?\nLet’s take a few minutes and use our heads. Maybe we can wrap it all up\nbefore we give it to the cops. Betty Smith was a blonde incendiary.\nCould be she touched off one too many boy friends. All we got to do is\nfind out who she knew and—”\n\n“That I already know,” declares Bill harshly. “What I’m curious about is\nhow you happened to hire her. She has been Buck Clancy’s private\nsecretary for three years. You know who Buck Clancy is?”\n\n“Hell yes!” Benny looks astonished. “He’s been a big racket boss around\nChicago as long as I can remember—twenty years anyway.”\n\n“Twenty years or more,” says Bill, suddenly thoughtful. “He lasted\nbecause he kept his operations fairly clean. As many times as he has\nbeen investigated, he has yet to be indicted.\n\n“A smart operator. And he had a damn smart secretary. Whatever she was\ndoing in your office, I don’t think Buck is going to like having her\nshot. He once told me she was the only one he could depend on for\nbusiness details—meaning confidential business. So how come she was\nworking in your office? Who hired her, and why?”\n\n“That’s easy,” says Benny, easing the phone out of sight. “We ran an ad\nand interviewed the applicants. This Betty Smith stood out like a house\nafire. She had looks, brains, manners and plenty of experience, though\nshe didn’t mention Buck Clancy, and we never bothered to check her\nreferences.”\n\n“How did you word that ad?”\n\n“It was very simple,” says Benny. “Let’s see—‘Secretary-Receptionist.\nSmart appearance for modern detective agency. Milligan, Swartz &amp;amp;\nPeters.’ And the address and phone number.”\n\n“You used your own names?”\n\n“Sure. That was last week and we hadn’t decided on the firm name yet.\nYou think the names had something to do with—”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Cop Shooting Our Secretary\n\nThere is a scuffling and growling out in the reception room. Benny and\nBill Faris tiptoe down the hall and ease the door open a crack. Then\nBenny pushes it wide and confronts the trio of desperate looking\ncharacters who have just jostled each other into the reception room.\n\nBig Herbie is panting and clutching a stocky, hard-eyed guy whose face\nhas just recently been worked over. It is red and puffed in spots and\none eye is already beginning to swell around the edges. The stocky guy\nis swearing with a kind of helpless rage. Mug Milligan is not mussed up\nlike the other two, but he has a gun in his hand and looks completely\ndangerous. The blank, sculptured mask of his face is etched with livid\nblue scars, made deeper by excitement, and his light gray eyes look\ndeadly in that unnatural setting.\n\n“Here—for God’s sake!” snaps Bill, coming forward. “Let that man go.\nWhat do you think you’re—”\n\n“Get—outa—here!” says Herbie with ominous emphasis. “This rat shot\nBetty! We caught him on the fire stairs. Mug trailed up after him while\nI grabbed an elevator and came down on him from above.” Herbie shakes\nsome more swear words out of the frantic guy.\n\n“I oughta mash him!” he adds with thoughtful savagery.\n\n“You’re crazy!” yells Bill. “He’s a cop!”\n\n“All the more reason,” says Herbie, clouting the guy on the ear, “why I\nshould mash him! The idea of a cop coming around here and shooting our\nsecretary. I oughta—”\n\n“Hold it!” says Benny sharply. “If Bill Faris says he’s a cop, then he\nis a cop. What makes you think he shot Betty?”\n\nHerbie and his prisoner both start jabbering at once, but Mug’s deep\nvoice cuts in and sounds through the din.\n\n“There was one shot,” says Mug. “Herbie and I were each in our own\noffices. I got here first and I saw at once that Betty was dead. The\nshot drilled her from the front and shattered the back of her head.\n\n“I opened the door to the hallway, but there was no one in sight. The\ndoor to the fire stairs is just a few feet away and I got to it as fast\nas I could. I thought I heard steps going up. Herbie came out of the\noffice just then and I told him to take an elevator up three or four\nflights and come down the stairs while I went up.\n\n“This fellow was sneaking up the stairs with his gun drawn. He\nthreatened me with the gun just as Herbie came hopping down from above.\nWe got him by surprise and disarmed him. This is his gun. If he didn’t\nshoot Betty, he must know who did.”\n\n“Bert, what’s this all about?” demands Bill of the stocky guy, whose\nface is getting purple.\n\n“You think I’m gonna talk in front of these crazy baboons?” snarls Bert.\n“Get on that phone and call headquarters! I’ll put these guys where they\ncan’t—”\n\n“No!” says Mug as Bill moves toward the phone. “We’re not turning this\nbird loose as easy as that. I don’t trust him, or you either, for that\nmatter.” He walks across the room with only a slight hitch in one foot\nand opens a closet door. “In here with him, Herbie. If he yells, nobody\noutside can hear him.”\n\nThere is a slight struggle, but Herbie clamps arms like a champ\nwrestler’s on the stocky guy and boosts him across the room and into the\nsupply closet with a final grunt. Mug turns the key and sticks it in his\npocket. Then he looks down at Betty with that blank face.\n\n“Have you phoned the police yet?” he asks Benny quietly.\n\n“No. We just got here,” says Benny. “And Bill was telling me Betty was\nBuck Clancy’s private secretary. By the way, this is Bill Faris, the\nreporter I was tellin’ you about. You can put the gun down. He’s\nharmless.”\n\n“Has that gun been fired?” asks Bill sharply.\n\n“It’s fully loaded now,” says Mug. “But he could have taken care of that\non the stairs. What do you know about him?”\n\n“He’s Bert Scalina, just a routine cop, as far as I know. He’s never\ndone anything sensational, or been mixed up in any scandals. If you\nfellows will take my advice, you’ll phone headquarters right now, before\nyou get in a bad jam with the department.”\n\n“If you’re right about that cop,” says Benny, “we’re in a jam already. A\nfew minutes one way or the other ain’t gonna make much difference.\nHerbie, lock the door. Let’s go inside and—”\n\n“Look, I’m just a reporter,” says Bill. “I don’t care what you fellows\ndo, but I don’t want to be included in.”\n\n“You’re in whether you like it or not,” Mug informs him coldly. “If the\npolice walk in here now, we’ll all be held—you included. Whether that\ncop in the closet is the murderer or not he’ll do his best to hang it on\nus. You may be able to alibi Benny, but Herbie and I—”\n\n“Sure, sure,” says Benny. “We got to protect ourselves, and that’s what\nwe’re in business for—protection against crime. So let’s quit futzin’\naround and get down to business. First off, I want to do some phoning\nand find out if Betty is still supposed to be workin’ for Buck Clancy.\nIf she is, then there’s a tie-up right there, and it means she was here\nfor no good. She must’ve been planted, and all we have to do is find out\nwhy, and we got the answer to all this.”\n\n“Of course,” says Bill thoughtfully, “I can always say I was\nintimidated, and it wouldn’t be my fault if somebody took my address\nbook out of my inside coat pocket and found the telephone number of Buck\nClancy’s private office …\n\n“This is her cousin Oscar, from Oskaloosa,” says Benny into his office\nphone. “I just got in town, and I got some fresh corn for her. If she\nain’t there, where can I locate her? Oh. Last week? Where did she go?\nOh. Is that right? No, I hadn’t heard about it. Gosh, that’s too bad.\nUh-huh. Well, thank you kindly.”\n\n“That,” says Benny, putting down the phone, “was some dumb little chick\nin Buck’s office. She says Betty Smith left last week to take a\nvacation, on account of she was all broken up over her boy friend. Her\nboy friend was Deal Bracken. He’s dead—too.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nHer Right Name Was Garman\n\nBill Faris snaps a light at his cigarette and blows smoke toward the\nceiling, not looking at anybody.\n\n“So,” Benny continues, “it shapes up like this. Deal Bracken was the guy\nthat got shot a couple weeks ago. Accordin’ to the papers, he was about\nthe smartest contact man Buck Clancy had workin’ for him. He got to the\nright people at the right time, and swung deals for the Clancy combine.\nSo he gets plugged, and a few days later his girl friend takes a\nvacation and shows up here to apply for a job. And a few days after\nthat, she gets plugged. What did you find, Mug?”\n\nMug pushes a flat white purse aside and looks at the conglomeration of\nstuff spread out in front of him. “Aside from her keys,” he says, “the\nonly other things that mean anything are a shopping list that looks a\nlittle out of season, and a lawyer’s card. The lawyer’s office is in\nthis building, but the shopping list is made up of things a woman would\nbuy in the middle of winter instead of the middle of summer.”\n\n“Poor Betty!” sighs Herbie. “Now she won’t never find no gold mine! ”\n\n“What are you talkin’ about?” demands Benny.\n\n“She had a lotta them little books like they give out in ticket\noffices,” explains Herbie. “They were all about Alaska and Canada, with\na lotta snow and dog teams. And when I kidded her about goin’ to such a\ncold place, she says it’s worth it if you hit a gold mine. And then she\nsays forget it, she’s only lookin’ at the pictures to cool off, and she\nwouldn’t think of leavin’ her swell job here, even if she had enough\nmoney to go as far as Alaska.”\n\n“That sounds,” says Benny, “like she meant to make a clean-up and then,\nstart travelin’. What, do you think, Bill?”\n\n“I wouldn’t know,” replies Bill lazily. “I’m not a travel agency.”\n\n“Okay,” Benny snaps him up. “So we can phone around to get travel\nagencies and find out if she made any reservations. Get the phone book,\nHerbie, and start callin’. Just say you’re the police department, and if\nthey got no reservation for Betty Smith, ask what name have they got\nwith a reservation to the far North. Where you goin’, Mug?”\n\n“Down to consult her lawyer,” says Mug, hitching himself toward the door\na little stiffly. “I’ll say she’s in trouble and I’m her employer. That\nought to get some information out of him.”\n\n“Is anybody holding me here?” inquires Bill mildly.\n\n“Yes. Pipe down,” says Benny.\n\n“I was just checking up,” says Bill, settling himself deeper in his\nchair. “Whenever you get through holding me, let me know. I’ve got a\ncouple of other assignments this afternoon.”\n\n“Nothing could pry you out of here,” retorts Benny. “Not even the Fire\nDepartment, with the joint burning down. Where did you write down Betty\nSmith’s home phone number? I can’t find anything in this damn book. I\nthought reporters knew something about the alphabet.”\n\n“We get tired of it. Besides her right name was Garman.”\n\n“You scrounge!” growls Benny. “Why didn’t you say so? Write that down,\nHerbie. The reservations might be for Betty Smith or Garman. G-a-r –“\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nPsychology\n\nThe shot sounds dull and muffled from the reception room. After one\nstartled moment, Benny and Bill both leap for the door and collide, with\nHerbie butting into them from the rear.\n\nWhen they finally get untangled and reach the outer room, the smoke and\nsmell of cordite still hangs over the sprawled figure on the opposite\nside of the curved desk from Betty. The closet door is wide open, and\nthe desk phone is off its cradle, dangling along the side of the desk.\n\nBert Scalina looks stockier than ever lying there on his back with a\nbullet hole between his eyes from which a thin bright stream is seeping.\n\nBenny walks cautiously around the body, picks up the phone receiver\ngingerly, listens a moment and replaces it carefully.\n\n“I think that was police headquarters,” he says flatly.\n\nThe hall door opens and Mug steps in, stops, and reaches for the gun in\nhis pocket. His eyes are a flat gray as he stares at Bill Faris.\n\n“We don’t know who done it,” says Benny hastily. “We were all inside\nwhen it happened. He got out of the closet some way and he was phoning\nsomebody. If it was headquarters—”\n\n“If it was,” says Mug coldly, “we’d better get out of here.”\n\n“That’s no good!” snaps Bill. “You can’t get away with—from this!”\n\n“No, of course not,” says Mug. “But if my hunch is right, we can do\nsomething about it before the police get here and delay everything.\nObviously that cop didn’t shoot Betty, but he knew who did. The killer\nused the fire stairs once to get away, so he’ll probably try it again.\nLet’s go, Herbie. Same tactics. Benny you go on up higher and come down\nfrom there. You,” Mug jerks his head at Bill, “come with me. You don’t\nhave to be afraid. I’ve got a gun in case we meet anything oh the\nstairs. Of course, I might use the gun on you … .”\n\nBenny eases through the metal fire door on the twenty-third floor and\nlistens a moment. There are no human sounds coming up from the deep well\nof the stairs. Only the muted echoes of a giant office building.\nCautiously he slips down the stairs, rounding one silent landing after\nanother, until the stillness begins to get him and he wants to yell\ndown, at least to find out if Herbie is there. Just as he leans over the\nrailing, the shot roars and echoes up from far below, and much closer,\nonly about three flights down there is a wild scuffling going on.\n\nBenny goes down the stairs, practically sliding on his heels, and\nsailing around the bends on one arm. Herbie has a big, red-faced guy\nbacked up in a corner of a landing and he is jabbing at the guy’s face\nwith the heel of one hand while he holds him with the other.\n\n“Hey!” yells Benny. “Who are you pokin’?”\n\n“I don’t know,” pants Herbie. “He was on the stairs, and Mug said—”\n\n“Cut it out, damn it!” Benny starts pulling at Herbie’s piston arm.\n“Somebody got shot down below! We gotta—”\n\nDoors bang open and cops start converging on them from above and below.\nThere is much confusion. Everybody is indignant, especially the cops,\nbut Benny and Herbie and the red-faced guy finally wind up back in the\noffices of the GI Protective Bureau where the Homicide Squad is worse\nthan indignant. According to one wild-eyed sergeant the entire personnel\nof the Bureau and all their friends are going to the electric chair\ntomorrow.\n\nBenny and Herbie along with the red-faced guy are shoved into the\nconsultation room with a uniformed cop.\n\n“Why,” Benny demands of Herbie, “did you have to stop and poke this guy?\nJust when the shooting starts down below, why did you pick a fight with\na perfect stranger?”\n\n“Psychology,” says Herbie. “When I meet him on the stairs, I make off\nlike I’m a cop, and I ask him if he’s got a gun. See, if he don’t have\nno gun, then he ain’t the guy I’m lookin’ for, and he’ll say so. But if\nhe has got a gun he’ll start worryin’. That’s psychology. Well, this guy\ndon’t say aye, yes or no. He starts throwin’ stuff over the railing.”\n\n“What kind of stuff?”\n\n“How do I know? I don’t get a chance to see it. So I poke him. Ain’t\nthat right?”\n\n“Maybe,” says Benny wearily. “Maybe not.”\n\nThe burly, red-faced guy sits in a corner and says nothing.\n\n“Where’s Mug?” asks Herbie. “And that newspaper guy?”\n\n“You tell me!” mutters Benny gloomily, never expecting to see either of\nthem again.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nInterference With Proper Processes Of Law And Order\n\nHe is somewhat surprised, therefore when a police captain ushers them\nboth into the consultation room. Neither one shows any signs of bullet\nholes. Mug’s face is blank as ever, but Bill’s is convulsed with\nexcitement as he looks across at the red-faced guy.\n\n“Hello, Clancy,” he says, and his voice isn’t as friendly as it ought to\nbe.\n\nBenny sits up and his eyes start snapping and darting around as his mind\nturns over at about 3,500 RPM.\n\n“Is that Mr. Clancy?” says Herbie in surprise. “Cripes! If I’d known who\nit was, I don’t think I woulda poked him so quick!”\n\n“Pipe down!” says Benny. “You all right, Mug?”\n\n“I’m fine,” says Mug in his deep voice, and there is a live ring to it\nthat wasn’t there before. “That gun explosion you heard came from the\ngun that was dropped over the railing. The safety was off, but it didn’t\ndo any damage … except to the killer. It has his prints on it.”\n\n“Sure, sure,” says Benny, getting in a quick plug, “that was nice fast\nwork on our part, nabbing him before he could get out of the building.”\n\n“It will take a good deal more than that to explain your out in this,”\nsays the police captain angrily. “The fact that you did nab him is the\nonly thing that may save you from indictment. The list of charges isn’t\ncomplete yet, but we’ve already got enough against you—”\n\n“I think most of it can be explained satisfactorily, captain,” says Mug.\n“First of all, we had no idea that we might be obstructing justice. We\nhad no way of knowing that you were on Clancy’s trail, or even that you\nsuspected him of murdering his own man, Deal Bracken. Therefore, we\ncouldn’t know that officer Bert Scalina was tailing Clancy when he came\nhere, and of course, Scalina told us nothing. He was free and going\nabout his business, telephone headquarters in fact, when Clancy came on\nhim and shot him. We immediately started the search for Clancy—”\n\nThe angry, and still wild-eyed sergeant comes into the room with a\nhandful of memos. “More evidence,” he rasps, “of impersonating a police\nofficer. We’re getting reports from every travel agency in town. They\nclaim we phoned for information!”\n\n“Have you got anything?” asks the captain.\n\n“Clancy,” growls the sergeant. “He booked reservations for himself and\nwife—to California in two weeks. He used his own name, Bernard X.\nClancy. Only he ain’t got a wife.”\n\nThe red-faced Clancy explodes unexpectedly with a foul epithet.\n\n“If you want to talk, go ahead and talk,” says the captain.\n\n“Lawyer!” snaps Clancy curtly.\n\n“So it was the dame!” says Benny, and looks at Bill triumphantly. “I\ntold you she burned up one too many boy friends. Buck Clancy falls for\nher and knocks off her favorite guy, so he can marry her and take a\nhoneymoon trip to California.”\n\n“That’s only part of it,” grins Bill. “This guy Deal Bracken was\ndouble-crossing his boss, with little Betty’s help. They planned to\nclean up and clear out. Meanwhile Betty was stringing Buck along, with\nmarriage plans, as you say. When Buck found out about it, he got rid of\nDeal Bracken—but fast. Since his reservation still stands, he apparently\nthought he could still marry Betty. But she couldn’t take the murder of\nher lover. My idea is that she didn’t dare go to the police with\ninformation about Buck that might lead to his arrest for the murder. She\ncame here in answer to your ad, with the intention of getting you to\nsolve the murder. She was making plans for a quick getaway so she must\nhave been afraid Buck would try to get her either before or after she\ncould get him pinched.”\n\n“I think,” says Mug, “that she had already made her arrangements. With\nthat lawyer downstairs. He drew up a will for her and she left some\ninstructions about certain payments to be made, he didn’t say to whom,\nbut he hinted that it was to our firm for services to be rendered,\nwhether she was still living or not. You can,” he tells the captain,\n“subpoena all that stuff if it will help your case any.”\n\n“Don’t worry,” says the captain harshly. “We will. We will also hold\neach of you as material witnesses—”\n\n“Captain, I’m a member of the press,” objects Bill Faris.\n\n“You can write your story in the lockup,” says the captain grimly.\n\n“We’re going to hold each and every one of you until we get these\ncharges sorted out and applied where they belong. In all my experience I\nhave never seen so much interference with proper processes of law and\norder. And don’t tell me you can explain it, because you can’t! What\npossible excuse can any sane adult have for bawling things up the way\nyou have?”\n\n“Psychology,” says Herbie brightly.\n\n“What?” snorts the captain.\n\n“Psychology. It’s complicated,” says Herbie. “But we’re supposed to work\nlike hell to make people think we’re earnin’ our living.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  It’s Me, Honey\n  Harvey’s Cigarette Case\n  They’ll Never Suspect A Thing\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nIt’s Me, Honey\n\nPomfret walked slowly up the path to his front door, clicked his key in the lock and stepped into the warmth of his own hallway. For a moment he stood there in the semi-darkness, breathing hard, tilting his head, smelling the old familiar smells and wondering at himself for the thing he was about to do.\n\nHis wife, Eva, called down from upstairs, “Joe, is that you?”\n\nPomfret shivered and tightened his hand around the bulky object in his overcoat pocket. He said, as steadily as he could, “It’s me, honey,” and tasted for a brief moment a spasm of panic.\n\nHe took a cigarette from his breast pocket and tucked it between dry lips, dragging in the taste of the unlit tobacco. Then he took off his coat and hat and threw them over the packed bags lying near the hat-rack by the door, and with the package in his hand, walked stealthily out into the kitchen and opened the door leading down into his workshop in the cellar. He stood at the head of the wooden steps, feeling the hot rush of blood into his face and the dizziness in his head. He went down the stairs and turned on the light.\n\nWith the dry cigarette still waggling between his lips, Pomfret sat down at his bench.\n\nCarefully, he unwrapped the package, revealing an expensive bronze table lighter fashioned after a globe of the world, with the ignition plunger where the north pole should be, and the countries etched in neatly.\n\nOverhead, the echo of his wife’s footsteps jarred through the floor, hurrying him along. He pulled the cigarette away from his lips, tearing off a strip of skin, and reached over to the rack for a screwdriver. He unscrewed the filler cap, picked out the cotton wool, threw it in a wastebasket. From the rack where his reloading tools lay he took down a canister of pistol powder. Next he removed the wick from the lighter and fitted into its place a short, fast-burning fuse, and began pouring the powder into the base of the lighter.\n\nHe knew powders, he knew gas pressures. He knew what would happen when someone picked up the lighter, holding it close to the end of the cigarette, and pressed the plunger for a light. They’d get a light, all right, a light that would show them the way into eternity.\n\nWithout air space, the hundred-odd grains of powder compressed into that bronze base would be as deadly as a hand-grenade. Pomfret had seen it work once before. Just four grains of powder jammed down by an improperly hand-loaded bullet to the bottom of a cartridge case, without air space for the expanding pressure of the gas.\n\nHe still had the wreckage of a once perfectly good heavy-frame revolver in one of the drawers in his filing cabinet.\n\nWhen he had screwed the cap back in place he picked up the lighter, carrying it as cautiously as he would have carried a bottle of nitro-glycerine, and walked up the stairs. He felt as weak as if he had spent the afternoon running around the block. He closed the cellar door behind him and leaned his back against it, hard, until his shoulder blades ached from the contact.\n\nHe went over to the tap for a drink of water. Then he walked slowly back into the living room and placed the lighter gently on the cocktail table, where no one could miss seeing it.\n\nHe knew how it would react on Harvey. He knew it would be the first thing Harvey, a chain-smoker, would pick up.\n\nHe closed his eyes and thought about Harvey’s handsome face. Then he went out into the hallway and began putting on his hat and coat.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nHarvey’s Cigarette Case\n\nEva came down the stairs, and Pomfret paused by the door, watching her, taking her in, gauging the full fluid motion of her body and the slow swing of her long tawny hair and the full rich beauty of her face, feeling again the desire for her and the need of her.\n\nHe stopped then, and turned toward the living room and took a hesitant step.\n\nShe said, “What’s wrong, Joe?” and the sound of her voice clipped his resolution in half.\n\nPomfret laughed, the cracked sound of it echoing hollow and false in his brain. “Nothing at all,” he said lamely. “Tired, I guess. Had a hard day.”\n\nShe came to him and rested her hand on his arm. The touch of her pulled the trigger on his mind and the hatred in him welled up then and flowed fresh and potent until he thought he would kill her then and there, without benefit of gadgets or tricks or long-range plans, if she didn’t take her hand off him.\n\nHe said, hoarsely, “Has Harvey called for his cigarette case yet, Eva?” and his keen, suspicious eyes probed hers for some sign of fear or admission of her guilt.\n\nShe took her hand away and color touched her cheeks.\n\n“For heaven’s sake, Joe, do we have to go through all that again? I told you he left it in the living room the last time he was here, and I took it upstairs to the bedroom so I wouldn’t forget to ask you to give it back to him when you saw him at the office. Isn’t that reasonable enough for you? Do you expect me to go down on my knees and beg for belief from my own husband?”\n\nHer voice was as tight as a plucked violin string, vibrating against the resistance in his mind.\n\nHe thought again of the lighter on the living room table. He let out his breath. The taste in his mouth was as sour and he wanted to be sick.\n\nInstead he reached for her and kissed her harshly, feeling the softness of her against him, the elusive, heady perfume, the taste of her lipstick.\n\nFeeling, too, the resistance that had been there for months now.\n\n“Okay,” he said quietly. “Okay, hon. Let’s skip it.”\n\nHe opened the door and reached down for his bags.\n\n“I’ll be back,” he said, as if it mattered. “It may take time. Maybe a week or more.”\n\n“You be careful of those Toledo blondes,” she said, smiling up at him. “I don’t know if I should trust you that far away from home.”\n\nTrust me! he thought bitterly. You don’t know if you can trust me?\n\nHe tried a laugh on, just to see if it would fit, and when it didn’t, he turned and walked quickly from the house to the car. There was a harsh bitter nip of Fall in the air. The breaths he took crackled in his lungs and reminded him of football games and the sharp clean tang of mustard on hot-dogs and the closeness and warmth Eva had been to him then, before Harvey joined the firm and began his series of weekly visits, finally moving into the house next door.\n\nPomfret almost tore the transmission out of the car getting it into second gear. As he passed Harvey’s house he saw the shadow of Harvey’s bulk against the windowshades, and he knew that before he reached the corner the big eager man would be sneaking slyly through the gate in the hedge to where Eva waited for him.\n\nHe put the car into high gear and went down the street and turned the corner, out of sight.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThey’ll Never Suspect A Thing\n\nHarvey grinned. He had a good-natured, boyish grin that worked well with some types of women. He stood in the middle of Joe Pomfret’s living room, staring at Joe Pomfret’s wife. There was sweat on his face.\n\nHe said, “Look, from now on, it’s so much velvet, Ev. Everything’s going to be okay. It’ll all be over soon.”\n\nHe walked over to the table and spun a pack of cigarettes so that one flipped out. This he tapped on the table and put in his mouth. He picked up the bronze lighter and held it in his hand.\n\n“Neat little gadget,” he said, making his voice loud, as if to drown out his own thoughts and the ones in Eva’s mind. “Where’d you get it?”\n\nShe sat tensely on the edge of the studio couch, staring at her hands. The whip in his voice brought her head up and she glanced at the lighter, then shrugged impatiently.\n\n“I don’t know. Joe, I guess. He’s always bringing something home.” She wet her lips. “When, Harv? How long will it be?”\n\nHarvey put the lighter back on the table and poured himself a stiff drink. He put it down his throat in one long smooth motion, and glanced at his watch.\n\n“When he hits the Turnpike hill,” he said, keeping his voice even, “he’ll have to brake hard for the sharp turn there. When he does, the brake cable goes. I took care of the emergency, too.”\n\nHe poured another drink, rattling the bottle against the glass.\n\n“It’s a hundred foot drop through that fence. He won’t feel a thing.”\n\nShe shivered. He took the cigarette from his mouth and went over to her. She came willingly and easily into his arms. He kissed her in a way that Joe Pomfret had never known and would never learn, now.\n\nFor a moment she lay still in his arms, her breath hot on his face, her eyes closed. The room was very still.\n\nHarvey put the cigarette back in his mouth and pushed her gently away.\n\n“It’s going to be fine, angel. They’ll never suspect a thing.” Her mouth touched his again, jostling the cigarette.\n\nShe smiled. Her hand searched out across the table, touching the rough etched metal of the lighter, closing around it.\n\nShe slid her other arm around his neck, pulling his head down to hers, touching the lighter to the end of his cigarette. Her lips brushed his ear.\n\n“Light, darling?”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Bess likes our over-sized, overstuffed, over-rated,\nbrave-but-only-half-baked county sheriff.\n\nShe failed to note his angry mood, said: “’Lo, Sam,” her usual greeting.\nSpaulding failed to reply, so Bess turned to me and gave forth a sound\nbest described as a giggle gone goofy. And then she said: “What now,\nMike? What ails my palsy-walsy?”\n\n“Damfino, Brick,” I replied. “The big mucky-muck mushed in here, only a\ncouple of minutes ahead of you, and all he’s done so far is to stare and\nglare.”\n\nSo Bess said: “What’s biting you, Sam? Speak up! I’m your good friend,\nyou know. Ignore ‘Murder-Minded’ Mike Murphy, and tell your constant and\nfond admirer.”\n\nThat brought a one-word reply. Ol’ Sam roared: “Nuts!”\n\n“He probably means that he’s gone nuts, Bess,” I ventured.\n\nOl’ Sam bellowed: “More nuts!” Scowling deeply.\n\n“And being bugs, himself, he thinks everyone else is,” I continued,\nspeaking mildly—attempting to roil him up. You see, I know all the best\nways to do that little thing! And that did. It brought the sulky sap off\nthat stool in self-defense, crying indignantly :\n\n“Ye people think ye have a lot to contend with—puttin’ out an eight-page\nscandal sheet, once a week, filled with stuff ye buy or swipe from\nbig-name writers, mos’ly—but if ye had to run a jailhouse for a month\nye’d go wiggy-waggy, too. The same as me!”\n\nI thought things had gone far enough, and that I should try to\nstraighten the Big Boy out.\n\nSo I said: “I’ve never known you to have a great deal of trouble\nhandling your guys and gals—once you had them in your clink, Sambo.”\n\n“That’s ’cause ye don’t know. Plenty o’ ’em raise a heap o’ hell, over\nthere. Jus’ ’cause I don’t advertise the fact, ever’time somebody\ndoes—well, that don’t mean managin’ a jug is a jolly job, by a damned\nsight!”\n\n“Who’s in your remaining hair, now, Sam?” Bess quizzed, striking\nstraight at the root of the matter—like she really can, but seldom does.\nAnd for a damned wonder.\n\n“A young squirt who says his name is Joe Smith. Smith, hell! He’s a\nPole, or a Swede. Or a something.”\n\n“How do you know, if you don’t know, him? Maybe he really is Joe Smith.\nThere are several Smiths in this world—and there might be a Joe among\nthem. A guy by that name built Salt Lake City and—” I said.\n\n“Bosh! O’ course there are Joe Smiths in this world—but this guy ain’t\none o’ ’em. I’d bet on that.”\n\n“What did he do to get into your copious can? And what is he doing, now,\nto get you so upset?” I next inquired, adding: “Tell, Poppa.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Little Cuss\n\nThat blew or Sam up again, higher than a barrage balloon—which he\nsomehow resembles—but he finally cooled off and began giving us a few\nfacts.\n\n“Las’ Sunday night,” Sam began, “some dame phones in an’ tells me that\nthere’s a couple of guys out by her house actin’ s’picious as the very\ndevil. She says they are sneakin’ aroun’ an’ aroun’ a little groc’ry\nstore that’s owned by a widder woman, who’s away; an’ she thinks they’re\naimin’ to rob it.”\n\n“So what?” Bess prompted, as Sam slowed down.\n\n“So I dim’ in my car an’ rolled out there.”\n\n“Jolted out there, you mean, Sambo,” I corrected—and got hell for that\ninterference from both Sam and Bess.\n\nThen: “I got out there jus’ as these two guys—a great big bird, an’ this\nlittle bit o’ a bum—jus’ as they start to bash in a back door. I pile\nout o’ my rig an’ promtly proceed to collar ’em. I get a good holt on\nboth o’ them guys, before they realize they’ve got company; but\n’mediately after that they begin rarin’ an’ tearin’ an’ jitter-buggin’\naroun’ until the big bird finally manages to jerk himself loose. He\nruns. I keep a good hold on the little louse an’ pull out my gun an’\nholler for the bird makin’ off to halt. But he don’t, so I begin to\nfire. Miss him a mile, I do, ’cause the little punk keeps on squirmin’\nan jumpin’ an’ leapin’ aroun’ a-purpose to spoil my aim. But I hang onto\nthis little so-an’-so, I do—even if I have to give the big baby up as\nlost, temporarily.”\n\nSheriff Spaulding paused briefly, at this point, and a muttered\nmalediction escaped him. One not intended for our ears, I guess. And\nthen he continued:\n\n“Anyway, I finally get this crooked little cuss down to the calaboose\nan’ start questionin’ him. Then’s when he tells me his name is Joe\nSmith; that he has no more home than a white chip in a stud-poker game;\nthat him an’ this big bird was merely lookin’ for a place to sleep—an’\nthat if I ain’t satisfied to book him as Joe Smith, I can put it down as\nJoe Doe or Joe Roe, or I can go to hell!” Amusement glinted in Ol’ Sam’s\ndark-brown eyes, for a few moments, but vanished as he began talking to\nus again.\n\n“I pumped this putrid pup for an hour or so more, but made no progress\nat all. Had other things I jus’ had to do, so I heaved him in a cell.\nTol’ the turnkey to feed the young yap—an’ then see if he could get\nanything out o’ him. But Bert had no luck.”\n\nBert Fairchild is a combination turnkey and deputy sheriff who works for\nOl’ Sam. (He’s got six other deputies, but they live out around the\ncounty in various smaller towns and none of them hang around the jail\nmuch.)\n\n“Well, Monday mornin’ I tried again, but all I got was a lot o’ gas—an’\nsass. This queer squirt tells me that he has no idee who his buddy was.\nSaid he’d jus’ met him that Sunday afternoon, down in the jungles; an’\nthat all the name the guy had give him to call him by was ’Fatty.’ He’s\na damn’ liar, o’ course.”\n\n“What makes you so certain, Sam? The youngster could be telling you the\nexact truth,” Bess cut in to say; patting down a stray lock of her\nlovely red hair, and walking up close to Ol’ Sam. They are pals, and I’m\nstrong for the big gent, myself—even if I do rib him a lot.\n\n“Fatty ain’t this guy’s name, by one hell o’ a lot. He ain’t a fat\nfeller, at all. I had a holt on him, an’ he’s huge, all right—an’\ncertainly solid—but not fat. Not him! Anyhow, when this big bruiser\nbusted away from me, the little lug yelled: ‘Damn! Scram, Ham!’”\n\n“Perhaps Pee-Wee Picklepuss is a poet, Sam!” I just had to remark, and\ndrew one of our sheriff’s combination growl-scowls. Ol’ Sam has no\nspecial sense of humor. He don’t like my alleged wisecracks, not a-tall.\n\n“That shows me he damn-well knows him, an’ is lyin’ like hell,”\nSpaulding continued; hard of voice and eye, now. “So I’ve been fairly\nbusy mos’ o’ the time since, tryin’ to make him unzip his lip. Ain’t had\nno luck, though—so far. The little louse won’t sing a note; won’t even\ntalk to me. any more. … I don’t know what to do, less’n I sort o’\nthird-degree the truth out o’ him. … Yep, guess I’ll have to do that.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nPressure\n\nThat’s all Bess and I heard about Ol’ Sam’s contrary little prisoner for\nalmost a week, then the sheriff loped into our Ledger office and\ninformed us that he was now holding this Joe Smith on an\nattempted-burglary charge; that the Justice of the Peace had set “a\nthousand-dollar bail hold-order” on Smith—and that the little chap\ncouldn’t raise that many cents. Sam also swore out a “John Doe warrant”\nagainst the big boy who had wiggled loose, and escaped—he said—and was\nanxious to serve the same. “Would to, by cracky, an’ before very damn’\nlong,” he insisted, adding:\n\n“If I have to take the little louse apart an’ read what’s in his mind,\nmyself. I’ve got him where I can do it, too: in my basement cellblock,\nforty feet unnergroun’! I’ll use it for a bomb-shelter—when an’ if Loco\nAdolph Sicklebugle gets over here; but until he does this little louse\nstays there. Till all hell freezes over, less’n he talks!”\n\n“Bess and I didn’t realize what a Big Bad Bird you are, Sam! Did we,\nBricktop?”\n\nCarrot-top said: “No, Shorty.” To me; then to Sam: “Are you really going\nto treat him rough—misuse, abuse the young man? You—your size!”\n\nSam declared: “He’s goin’ to talk. That’s all. I’ll cut off his grub,\nan’ I’ll cut off his terbacker—an’ I’ll cut off his head if he don’t\ncome through with his buddy’s right name, an’ also tell me where to go\nto put my comealongs on him! No one guy’s goin’ to hold out on the\ninterests o’ justice, this way. Nor on me. No, sir! An’ he can yell all\nit suits him to, ’cause nobody can hear him, upstairs, or out on the\nstreets!\n\n“Br-r-r-r-r!” I said. And shuddered.\n\nSam replied: “Mabbe ye think I’m kiddin’, folks, but I ain’t. Wait an’\nsee! An’ I’ll keep ye both posted on how I’m progressin’. Or on how I\nain’t.”\n\n“It’s apt to be ain’t, Sambo. If the lad hasn’t come in on his pal, so\nfar, he’s not likely to—is he?” I quizzed, half sore at Ol’ Sam. I’ve\nnever liked this third-degree stuff. Consider it to be bad business, and\ndangerous.\n\n“It’s quite awhile yet before the grand jury meets, Shrimp,” Spaulding\nsnarled at me, adding: “An’ long before then, the bird’ll have talked.\nBet ye that he will!”\n\nI wasn’t having any.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nMy Advice\n\nHere, this recital of Ol’ Sam Spaulding’s trials and tribulations pauses\nonly long enough for me to record several pertinent facts, such as:\n\nSam first cut off young Joe Smith’s tobacco supply—hoping to make the\nyouth snitch on his pal—and then he chopped off Smith’s chow. Cut him\ndown to a plain bread-and-water diet; still hopeful, and just as\nunsuccessfully. All of which Ol’ Sam honestly reported to Bess and me;\nbut not for publication in my weekly Ledger, of course. That would never\ndo.\n\n“He’s still as stubborn as a stinkin’ Stuka stormtrooper!” Ol’ Sam\nrelated, sticking to his usual alliterative style!—but gumming his\nsimile all up. We, however, knew what he meant.\n\nThen three or four more days passed, and the sheriff blew in again. And,\nnow, we saw that Ol’ Sam had a beautiful black-and-blue left eye.\n\n“You ran into a cell door, I suppose !” I said to him—in a voice\nsupposed to be a bit silky.\n\n“Cell door, hell! I ran into that rotten runt’s right duke—so I did! I\nwas pullin’ his right rar, an’ I guess he didn’t like it. Anyhow, he\nsocked me a beaut, eh? But ye should see him! After he clouted me—well,\nI really went to work on him!”\n\n“What did he tell you his buddy’s name is?” I asked—knowing very well\nthat the kid hadn’t talked! (Else Ol’ Sam would have said so.)\n\n“He ain’t come across with that info’, yet, but by cracky, he will. He\nwill—or else!”\n\n“I’m thinking it will be ‘or else,’ Sambo,” I said; explaining: “When\nany bozo holds cut this long, it means that there just isn’t air\nsharp-nosed, longe-tailed, cheese-eating stuff anywhere in him!”\n\n“He’ll rat—before I’m through. Ye’ll see! He’s hungry. An’ plenty\nhungry. I’ve not fed the fool a decent meal in over three weeks. I—”\n\n“You should be ashamed of yourself!” I finished for him.\n\n“Ashamed, hell. I set out to make him tell me his pardner’s name, an’ I\nain’t feedin’ him till he does! Nor’ll I quit slappin’ him aroun’. He’s\ntoo small an’ too weak to really clout, any more; but I’ll still\ncontinue to go down there ever’day an’ cuff him—till he does squeal.”\n\n“He may do his sentence and be free some day, Sam. If so, you’d better\nwatch your step. It’s one thing to whip a mule that’s locked in a\nbox-stall, and quite another thing to tackle that same mule when he’s\nloose in a pasture! Then, too, there are a lot of good guns being\nmanufactured in the world today, you know; and Smith might later on get\nahold of one and mow you down with it. I wouldn’t go much further, if I\nwere you. It just isn’t safe.”\n\nThat was my advice. Now, see how good it was!\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nFinking\n\nThe kid down in the can cellar continued to stand pat, in spite Ol’\nSam’s “increased pressure,” for several days more and then like a bolt\nout of the blue—as Bess would put it—young Joe Smith, or whatever the\nhell his right name was, hauled off and told all! And not because of Ol’\nSam’s pressure but because he wanted to! (Or so he said.)\n\n“Sheriff, I’ve decided to tell you what you want to know,” Smith began,\nexplaining thusly: “My buddy was ‘Big Bill’ Burney, and what a swell guy\nhe’s turned out to be—leaving me in here to face the rap, alone, and not\neven sending me over a mouthpiece! No eats! No cigarettes! No nothing.\nHe’s a Big Ham, like I sometimes called him.”\n\n“That explains ye callin’ him ‘Ham.’ Keep goin’,” Spaulding said, making\nnotes on the back of an old envelope. The kid did. At some length.\n\n“You’ll find Big Bill hanging around Little Minnie’s Dollar Dug-out,’\ndown in Valley Alley, almost every night, Sheriff, and I want you to go\nget him. But you watch your step—because Big Bill is really tough! He’s\ndone a lot of wrestling and boxing, and he’s strong as an ox. You’d\nbetter take a deputy along, I think. But you get Bill, and after you get\nhim you shove the big bum right down here with me! Leave me to face this\nthing alone, will he? I’ll tell my big pal a thing or two—so I will—and\nthen I haul off and tell him why I snitched!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nLittle Minnie’s “Dug-out”\n\nOl’ Sam ignored Joe Smith’s advice about taking a deputy along with him\nto arrest Big Bui Burney, and went alone. Wasn’t he, Sheriff Spaulding,\na big man, too? Hadn’t he a warrant for Big Bill? And two good Colt 45s?\nSince when had he needed anyone with him—to pinch any just one man? And\nwasn’t he forewarned that this bozo might prove tough?\n\nLittle Minnie’s “Dug-out” was a dive well known to Ol’ Sam, too; as was\nLittle Minnie—who weighed nearly three hundred pounds, and had a\nwhale-sized mouth! Sam didn’t know any of her dames, and didn’t want to\nknow them. It was Min’s job to handle them, and he wisely let it go at\nthat. She always called him “when things got too hot for her to handle,\npersonally.” Which wasn’t often, Minnie was there, when Ol’ Sam barged\nin; and four other husky dames in scant garb, but heavily-rouged, sat at\na table sipping highballs. Spaulding said: “Keep your seats. This is no\nraid. I’m lookin’ for a fugitive from justice. One William Burney. ‘Big\nBill,’ folks mos’ly call him. They say he’s a hard guy. Any o’ ye seen\nhim lately?”\n\nOne of the broads said: “He was in here for a while, last night. It’s\ntoo early for him. Only eleven o’clock. Bill’s working somewhere. Try\nagain, about midnight.”\n\nLittle Minnie tried to catch this dame’s eye. Wanted her to shut up. Big\nBill spent a lot of dough at the Dug-out and if he went to jail, or to\nthe pen’—But she failed to get this jane’s attention and the already\nhalf-crocked female gabbled on.\n\n“What you want Big Bill for, Sheriff?” she asked.\n\n“For questionin’, Nosey,” Sam snapped back.\n\n“The name is Rosey, not Nosey! If I was Min’ I’d—”\n\n“You ain’t Min’, Rose! Shet your fool face. Sheriff Spaulding don’t come\nbustin’ down here, only when I call him—or he has a tip that—”\n\n“I ain’t saying he does, Min’—but just the same, if I was running this\ndump he wouldn’t ever get his fat belly inside that door. I’d make him\ndo his stuff outside. Outside, where he belongs! And I’d phone Big Bill\nand warn him that the law wanted him. So I would!” And Rose got up,\nshoved her chair back, and then staggered away from the table.\n\n“Where are ye goin’?” Ol’ Sam asked.\n\n“None of your business. Want to come along?”\n\n“Don’t ye try phonin’ Big Bill an’ warnin’ him, Woman. Ye do an’ I’ll\ntoss yer carkass in a cell. Come back here an’ squat!”\n\nRosey must have been quite a bit more than half-soused—or else a born\ncop-hater—for instead of obeying Ol’ Sam she walked over to the\nsideboard, grabbed up a stack of dinner plates, and began heaving them\nat the sheriff. The three other dames leaped away from the table and\nflew upstairs on wings of fright, while Little Minnie wobbled over to\nthe battling female and did all she could to save the balance of her\nexpensive chinaware—if not Ol’ Sam—but Rose just wouldn’t quit. The dame\nwas dingy, but her aim was good; and it was while the sheriff was\nstruggling to get handcuffs on the berserk female that Big Bill Burney\nwalked in the back door. Bill saw merely some great big bird, apparently\nbattling Rose and Min’, and so he waded in—swinging. And Big Bill could\nreally swing!\n\nOl’ Sam told me, later: “The big so-an’-so mus’ have hit me with a\nhammer, first, Mike—but after that he only used his fists. An’ did he\npaste me? I never went down—an’ came back up—so damn’ many times before\nin all my life! But, I finally got a gun out an’ made him unner-stand\nwhat it was all about. Had to clout him over the noggin’ a couple o’\ntimes with the barrel o’ it, first, though.”\n\nThen Ol’ Sam cuffed Big Bill Burney to a still-cussing “Wild Rose” and\ntook them to the clink. He uncuffed them, put Rose “in durance vile” in\nthe “she section” of his jail—as he calls it—and then he took Burney\ndownstairs to his basement lockup. To his bomb-proof, sound-proof little\ncellar, where young Joe Smith was still incarcerated and anxiously\nwaiting for Ol’ Sam to bring in his big buddy.\n\nThe sheriff, of course, was covered with blood—both his own and Big\nBill’s; and he even wore some of Wild Rose’s!—so he was a sight. And\nBurney did not look much better. He, too, was plastered with gore. Joe\nSmith took a good look at them, then began to laugh. To roar—when they\nfinally got there.\n\n“Yer snitchin’ pal’s laughin’ at ye, Bill!” Ol’ Sam said. “But he’s\nbanged up a bit, himself, ye will notice!”\n\nBig Bill sprang at Little Joe, then, saying: “And th’ damned little\nlousy snitchin’ rat is goin’ tuh be banged up some more! Squeal on me,\nwill yuh, Rodent!”\n\nAnd Big Bill Burney socked Smith a wallop that lifted the young man\nclear off the floor. Then Burney hit Joe again and again and again. And\nthen again! And until the youngster was completely out and lay on the\ncement floor like a bundle of old rags. “That’ll teach th’ fink better’n\ntuh stool on me—and when he comes to I’ll bust him again!”\n\n“Not tonight, ye won’t, Bill—’cause I’m lockin’ ye up in a cell. I don’t\nwant ye to murder the squealin’ rat. Not down here, see. Wait till ye\nget him down to the pen’. Then I don’t care what ye do! Get in Number\nTwo cell. The other one is his.” Burney obeyed. Ol’ Sam locked him up,\nwalked over and looked down at Joe Smith for a minute or so, saw that he\nwas breathing and would come around all right, then he started off. Big\nBill yelled at Ol’ Sam.\n\n“Ain’t yuh goin’ tuh lock that thing up, too?”\n\n“No. He can’t get away, an’ I’m leavin’ him out a-purpose. Ye may want\nsome water, or something, before I come down in the mornin’. If so, make\nhim get it for ye.”\n\n“I’d choke tuh death before I asked that rat tuh git me—” Big Bill\nbegan.\n\n“Have it yer own way. I’m goin’ upstairs an’ take a bath. See ye both\ntomorrer, an’ if ye’ll plead guilty to this attempted-bur, glary charge\nmabbe I won’t swear out an attempt-to-kill-an-officer warrant against\nye, Bill. Think it over.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nTrouble For Ol’ Sam\n\nA friend of mine dropped into my newspaper office early the next morning\nand told me that Ol’ Sam had arrested Big Bill Burney, and he gave me\nsome of the details about the doings out at the Dug-out—and also about\nRose Kelly’s arrest. (That, at least, was the name the dame “done\nbusiness” under, and really does not matter.) So when Bess—my red-headed\nwife—finally drifted down to work, about ten a.m., I told her about Ol’\nSam’s two pinches and said:\n\n“Guess I’ll sneak over to the calaboose and get the whole story. From\nSam. He’ll be too busy arraigning his two prisoners to come over here\nand tell us about it in time for me to write up the mess—which I want to\nuse in tomorrow’s paper. And I want to kid Sam a bit. This guy told me\nthat the sheriff took a damned good shellacking before he—”\n\n“I hope Ol’ Sam wasn’t hurt much, Mike. Go ahead. And while you’re out\nbe sure you stop at Reed’s Repair Shop and get your automatic. Jack Reed\nphoned me last night and told me to tell you that it was ready.”\n\nI promised to stop for it—and did. And a good thing, too! But wait.\n\nIt was about 10:20 when I walked into the jail-office, and all was as\nquiet as could be. I knew it was Ol’ Sam’s deputy’s “day off,” so I\nfigured Sam would be on the job, alone—and around somewhere. He was. But\nwait!\n\nI waited. Several minutes, Read some reward notices—official\n“dodgers”—looked back and saw that the door leading into the main\ncellblock was locked on the outside; and then I walked back to the door\nthat leads to Ol’ Sam’s basement block. That door was slightly open, I\nnoticed. “So that is where he is,” I thought. I pulled this door open a\nbit more, to pass through it, then stopped. Sudden. Damned awful\nsuddenly! For, from below, came a bedlam of sound: A mixture of\nfists-hitting-flesh sounds, mingled with vile curses.\n\n“Trouble, sure enough, down there,” I said to myself, drew my automatic\nand checked it to make sure that Jack Reed had left it loaded. It was,\nso I grasped it firmly and crept down those basement stairs. One step at\na time. More sounds, and more oaths, continued to roil up. Then\ndistinguishable words.\n\n“Beat up my little buddy, will yuh—yuh so-an’-so—yuh this-an’-that! Yuh\nbig-bellied bum! Take that!” Then a crashing sound. Then a\nhigher-pitched, younger voice, saying:\n\n“You had a lot of fun beating me up, down here, when you had me all\nalone—didn’t you? Well, it ain’t so funny now—is it?” Followed by\nseveral sounds that could only have been made by fists beating on flesh.\nA flock of loud curses and threats, made by Ol’ Sam. Then a lull. Then\nmore words. Explanatory words, now. Spoken by that younger, unseen\nvoice, but loaded with venom.\n\n“You couldn’t make me snitch, you big bully—in spite of you being damned\nnear twice my size, and me half starved to death—could you? No, sir! I\nheld out on you—plenty! Didn’t turn stoolpigeon until I had it all\nfigured out that you would walk right straight into my trap! Until I had\nyou doped out for a sap who’d fall like a Jap—mowed down with\nmachine-gun bullets!”\n\nSomeone groaned. It just had to be Ol’ Sam Spaulding, I knew. Some way\nor other these two crooks had managed it so that they now had the\nsheriff in their power. And very completely. I went cautiously down\nanother step. The sound of fists striking flesh, again—and again and\nagain and again—and then came that younger voice again:\n\n“No, Copper, I couldn’t beat you, alone—and I couldn’t possibly escape.\nSo what? Hah! I sent you to get my good pal—my old buddy, Big\nBill—knowing damned, well that the two of us could glom onto you when\nyou came down with your hands both busy carrying our breakfast tray! And\ndid you walk right into it! Hell, Sap—Bill’s first blow to your chin\nraised you a good foot off the floor! Funny—isn’t it? Funny as hell,\nnow! Ha, ha—ha!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nShoot-Out\n\nSo that was how this young slicker had managed the thing—was it?—and\njust what had I better do about it? I figured that they had Ol’ Sam down\non the basement floor, at least—and, no doubt, about out. In which event\nthey would have both of Ol’ Sam’s big .45s! What a mess this had turned\nout to be!\n\n“Should you try it?” I asked myself. “Try it, alone; or sneak back\nupstairs, block the upper door on them, some way, and go for help?” That\nwas what I had to decide—and it was a tough problem—and then these\ncrooks decided it for me when one of them said:\n\n“Let’s kill th’ big blankety-blank brute! If we don’t, somebody’ll find\nhim an’ set him free—soon—then he’ll spill his guts, get more guns, an’\ncome after us again. Then he’d kill us—when he caught us!”\n\nSo they did have Ol’ Sam’s guns, eh? And from the tone of that voice I\nknew that they really meant business. That they would bump off my old\nfriend. (I sass and otherwise abuse our grand old sheriff a lot, but I\ndon’t want anyone else to do it. No, sir!) So I got an even firmer -grip\non my swell Colt automatic—which has never jammed or otherwise missed\nfire on me yet—and made the bottom six steps in two noisy thumps.\n\nThe door which leads into Ol’ Sam’s basement cell-block was a regulation\njailhouse door over which the sheriff had wired a lot of steel slats.\nThis served to reinforce it, and I saw that in the event of a gun battle\nwith these birds it would give me additional protection—since only holes\nabout an inch and a half square remained to be shot directly through.\nNot, understand, that I thought these steel slats heavy or thick enough\nto stop a slug fired from either of the sheriff’s big guns, but they\nmight very well serve to deflect any such red-hot hunk of quickly fired\nlead.\n\nThis door was pulled nearly shut and I proceeded to slam it closed, all\nthe way. It would shut but not lock. Only Sam’s key would do that, and\nno key was in the lock or anywhere in sight. (The crooks had it, I found\nout later.) Anyway, I was too damned busy to look for a key or anything\nelse—just getting the muzzle of my automatic through one of those little\nholes. I fired and yelled at the same time, I guess. Fired two shots,\nright between these two crooks’ heads as they stood right over a\nreclining Ol’ Sam, who I saw was bound and gagged—and I roared:\n\n“Drop those guns, instantly, or I’ll mow you down!”\n\nEach guy had one of the sheriff’s Colts in his right fist; and when they\ndid not obey quick enough to suit me, I fired again. Hit the big bird,\ntoo, that time. Got him in his right elbow—aiming at his mid-ribs, I\nwas—but it had the same effect! His gun flew out of his hand and\nclattered to the floor. He let out an agony scream, grabbed his\nshattered right elbow in his left hand and said; ‘I quit. Copper! Pal,\ndrop your gat, too.”\n\nBut still-mad Joe Smith—who Ol’ Sam thought was a lousy\nstool-pigeon—wasn’t having any. No, sir. Young Joe was made of sterner\nstuff. He whipped around and sent three sizzling hot hunks of lead my\nway! A horizontal iron bar stopped one of these slugs, right in front of\nmy “V for Victory” belt buckle; and the other two ate chunks out of\nthose steel slats—which zinged all around my head. Those brave Russians\nover in Stalingrad, who survived, never came any closer to death than I\ndid, right then; but the young devil wasted his last three shots by\nfiring over my head. I was sure of him, now that his gun was empty; and\nI swarmed in on him before he could reach for, and get, the Colt that\nBig Bill Burney had dropped. He did reach, but I slammed a .38 slug at\nhis hand, while the going was good, that caused his right thumb and a\nfore-finger to disappear. Then both crooks decided that I was bad\nmedicine and called it a day. (That suited me, also, I might add!)\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nOl’ Sam\n\nOl’ Sam? He’s in City Hospital yet, the Big Bum: But he’ll be out in a\nday or so—and am I waiting for him! Bess says I mustn’t rub it\nin—because that gag these two crooks put in Ol’ Sam’s mouth nearly\nkilled him. But that is what I’m aiming to rib him about. You see, they\ntied Sam up with his shoe laces, belt and necktie—but they gagged him\nwith a pair of his own stinky socks!\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  You—You Killed Him\n  This Looks Bad For You, Old Fellow\n  The Truth In Less Than Hour\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nYou—You Killed Him\n\nIt started and ended with the garden hose, but there was a murder coiled\nup in the middle. Dad Wells was sprinkling his flowering petunias, his\nbare feet comfortably tickled by the lush carpet of green grass between\nthe rock-bordered beds. His pointed goatee matched the whiteness of the\ncumulus clouds boiling up this hot June forenoon. His eyes held the blue\nof the sky they invaded.\n\nThe fragrance of nut-brown baking loaves wafted across his neatly\ntrimmed hedge from the bakery and gave him visions of yellow butter and\nred strawberry jam. But these tantalizing notions were abruptly cut off\nby a terrible, gurgling scream that rang out on the morning air from the\nshipping department of the bakery across the alley.\n\nDad dropped the hose and seized his wide suspenders with shock. Goose\npimples sandpapered his legs, though the thermometer on the side of his\nlittle white bungalow stood at ninety degrees. That cry was paced to the\nterror of sudden death.\n\nHe was running now. Across the gritty alley and in on the cool concrete\nwhere the orange and black trucks hauled away the fresh loaves. He heard\na scrape in the shipping clerk’s office, the clatter of something\nfalling, then a deathly silence.\n\nHis throat felt tight, but he forced himself to go on in and have a\nlook. The back of his neck crawled. Old Jonathan Bibb lay on his back in\na crimson welter of blood. A twelve-inch mechanic’s adjustable wrench\nhad crushed one side of his bald skull into an awful, unliving shape.\nThe killer had slipped out through the back door of the office, which\nstood a few inches ajar.\n\nJonathan’s big green cash box stood open. Dad knew it should be full of\nbills and silver from the drivers’ collections and on its way to the\nmain office upstairs. He kicked it out of the way under the desk and\nstooped to feel Jonathan’s pulse.\n\nThe throb of life had been stilled forever.\n\nSomeone gasped behind him, and Dad turned mechanically. Red Zyler, the\nlong-armed mechanic of the bakery fleet, stood with his big mouth open.\nHe stood looking at Dad, his eyes accusing until he could stop his wide\nyellow teeth rattling enough to blurt out:\n\n“You—you killed him.”\n\nDad moistened his lips. “I wouldn’t hurt Jonathan. He was my friend.”\nShaking, he picked his way around the sprawled corpse to the phone and\nasked the operator to call headquarters, there’d been a murder. When he\nlooked up again, a slim fellow in white duck slacks was standing in the\nopen door gulping and backing away, pointing at the dead man. His black\neyes were sprung wide by terror. His thin shoulders shook under an\nopen-necked, silk sports shirt.\n\n“He’s dead, ain’t he?” he demanded. “I’m after the money. What’ll I do\nwhen I have to go back up to the cashier without the money?” He turned\nand ran, shouting out a general alarm.\n\nDad tugged desperately at his white goatee. He wanted to form a mental\npicture of the room before the others came stampeding in and mussed it\nall up. Jonathan had been a fanatic on good housekeeping. The inside of\nhis office was varnished perfection. It shone, except for his own blood.\nSomeone must have nicked his gleaming paint somewhere, Dad thought. His\nrepair kit is turned over. That patching plaster is all mixed up among\nhis nails, screwdriver, and other tools. Wouldn’t his neat soul suffer\nif he could see such confusion as that?\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThis Looks Bad For You, Old Fellow\n\nThe wide garage floor filled as if by magic with clacking-tongued bakers\nand office help. The superintendent of the bakery tried vainly to\ncontrol them, but it was no use. They ignored him. When Captain Carson\nwalked in a few minutes later he had to beat his way through them to the\ndoor where Dad was trying to keep the murder room free of stampede.\n\nCarson cleared the track efficiently and let the doctor and coroner\ninside. He looked over the dead man and his tomb a few minutes, then\nstarted jabbing Dad with saw-edged questions which brought a bead of\nnervous moisture to Dad’s upper lip.\n\nDad told his story simply and directly, mentioning how Red and the clerk\nfrom upstairs were the first to arrive. How fifty others working in the\nbuilding at the time had just as much chance at the dead man as they\nhad.\n\nCarson scratched his facts down in a ragged notebook. “Red, where were\nyou when this happened?”\n\n“Under that truck over there. Had the pan down. Someone crossed the\nfloor. The scream came a minute after that. By the time I could get\nloose and crawl out, Dad Wells was leaning over Jonathan and he was\ndead.”\n\nCarson grunted and pointed his cedar pencil at the slack-clad office\nclerk. “Marty, where were you?”\n\n“I’d been in the office all the time, until I came down after the\ndrivers’ money and found Dad Wells and Red here. That’s all. I beat it.”\n\nDad edged around where he could stoop and get a quick look under the\nbread truck Red said he was working on. The engine crank pan was not\ndown as the mechanic had said. It was covered evenly with a coat of road\ndirt and grease. Why had he lied about it? The wrench that did the job\nbelonged to him. He had a big family of freckled youngsters to feed,\ntoo. That took a lot of money.\n\nDad listened hopefully. But Carson couldn’t get another one of the\nemployees to admit they’d heard the scream or knew a thing about it,\nuntil after Marty had stormed the length of the building popping off his\nbig, loose mouth.\n\nCarson elbowed his way through the wide garage doors where two trucks\ncould drive abreast and across the alley to the hedge, which skirted\nDad’s little domain.\n\n“Look here.” He pointed back through the open doors to Jonathan’s office\nin the shipping room. “Dad, you could see pretty well what went on all\nthe time in there.”\n\nIt was a statement of fact.\n\n“Why, yes. I was interested in the business. Nice bunch of folks over\nthere. They all waved and said, ‘Hi, Dad’ and ‘Hello, Granpa’ and the\nlike.”\n\n“What does a man of your age live on?” Carson demanded suddenly.\n\n“I saved some when I was younger. It’s enough.”\n\nCarson jerked a thumb. Two uniformed men started working in around Dad’s\nflowerbeds, his green shrubs and fruit trees. Carson himself walked\nslowly along the broomlike stiffness, of the privet hedge, his red neck\narched, looking down. Then he snapped forward.\n\n“Here it is, boys. What kind of flower do you call this?”\n\nDad started, his old knees shaking inside his checkered poplin pants.\nWedged back under the drooping branches of the hedge was the green till\nfrom the cash box. It was significantly empty.\n\n“I didn’t do it,” Dad said lamely “There wouldn’t have been time to come\nback here before Red showed up. Besides, I didn’t leave him.”\n\nRed shifted his long arms. “I reckon you could have made it. It took me\nsome time to get loose from what I was doing and get out. You could have\nrun back here to the hedge, easy.”\n\n“This looks bad for you, old fellow,” Carson said. “You’re too old to\nhold a job, starving along on the skimpy interests of your savings. You\nsaw Jonathan handle that money day after day. Finally it got to be too\nmuch. Want to tell us about it?”\n\nDad felt his heart swell as if it would pop his chest. This stupid cop.\nDidn’t he have any sense at all? How could he associate murder with my\nphilosophy of life? My love of the beautiful. To Carson, all people were\nas much alike as paving bricks.\n\n“I won’t speak further without counsel. Am I to consider myself\narrested?”\n\n“Well, practically. Maybe you had better come along.”\n\nDad looked around the white cottage with its border of green shrubs and\nhis heart died within him. He’d never dreamed of leaving it as a common\ncriminal.\n\n“Wait a minute, all of you,” Dad said. ”I forgot to shut off my hose a\nwhile ago. And I’d like a last look at my double petunias before I leave\nthem forever.”\n\nThey followed him through the gate to the flowerbed he had been watering\nwhen he heard the death scream. The brass lawn nozzle lay sizzling in\nthe grass, a fine silvery spray of cold water catching a miniature\nrainbow from the sun. He stooped to retrieve it and swung it on them in\na slow arc. The dashing spray sounded like a rainstorm on a canvas tent\nas it swept across their trouser legs.\n\nIt he wasn’t in such danger he could have cackled with glee the way they\nsprang back as if the clean water were a flamethrower.\n\n“I’m sorry,” he apologized. “I’m not so chipper as I used to be.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Truth In Less Than Hour\n\nDad slowly followed the cop to the bakery. In the alley, he turned to\ntake his farewell of his little home.\n\n“Captain, some person in this group wants an old man to give up the last\nyears of his life to pay for a crime he didn’t commit. If you’ll let me\nline this crowd up along the side of this bakery in the hot sun, I’ll\nhave the truth in less than hour.”\n\nCarson permitted himself a sour grin. “Go ahead. It’ll take nearly that\nlong for the coroner and fingerprint men to finish in there.”\n\nThere was some muttering at this. Dad heard remarks like “sunstruck” and\n“crazy with the heat.” He was sorry for the innocent, but he was on\ntrial for his life. Unless this experiment worked, well—the chair has no\nrespect for gray hair. Strangely, he thought, how sweet life is to the\nold. Those with the shortest time to live hang on with the fiercest\ngrip.\n\nDad pattered up and down the line of scowling, sweating, and cursing\npeople. Girls held up their purses to keep the hot glare out of their\neyes, and the men assumed various attitudes. Some were as stoic as\nSpartans, others as fretful as children. Hot tar dripped out of a spout,\nand the asphalt shingles on the alley sheds curled in the blistering\nbreath of the sun.\n\nHe waited for about fifteen minutes, and knew he couldn’t go on. He\ncouldn’t bear to have people suffer like that. He stopped in front of\nRed. If he couldn’t bluff the truth out of the killer now, he might have\nto pay for his failure with his life. He gulped:\n\n“Red, why did you lie about the grease pan on that truck? You didn’t\neven touch ‘it.”\n\nRed looked around as if he’d like to dart away.\n\n“I got rattled, I guess. I was hiding out under there, resting a little\non my creeper. Had a party last night.”\n\n“So you heard me walk in and then heard the scream?”\n\n“Yes, I distinctly heard somebody go by. I had my head down against the\nconcrete. The heels cracked hard and fast on the cement.”\n\nDad laughed and pointed down. “And me bare-footed? I didn’t make as much\nnoise as a mouse when I went in there. You’re lying again. You—”\n\nRed cringed.\n\n“I didn’t kill him, I tell you. I swear I heard someone walk through\nthere.”\n\nDad glanced down at Red’s wrinkled pants legs where the water he had\nsprayed there was dried up now by the sun. It was now or never. He\nplunged to his knees, but it was the cuff of Marty’s duck slacks he\nseized with urgent hands.\n\n“Look here,” he cried to Carson. “It’s setting hard already. This\npatching plaster. He upset Jonathan’s repair kit. Some of the plaster\nfell down his leg and lodged in the cuff of his pants.”\n\nMarty cursed and jabbed suddenly at Dad’s twinkling eyes with braced\nthumbs, but Carson grabbed him roughly by the arm. “Cut it, Brother.”\n\nDad raised his eyes in thankfulness and looked across to his flowering\nlittle home.\n\n“If you’ll look up in the bakery office where Marty works, you’ll find a\ntill missing where he hooked it from another cash box. He planted it in\nmy hedge before the murder. He looked through the garage and couldn’t\nsee Red under the truck, so he thought the place was empty. He’d heard\nhim when he came through.”\n\nCarson jerked Marty toward his prowl car. “But, Dad, how did you know it\nwas him? Why not some of the others?”\n\n“Because I’d kicked Jonathan’s cash box out of sight under the desk to\nget it out of the way. When Marty comes in buggin’ his eyes, what does\nhe say? ‘What are they going to do to me when I go up without the\nmoney?’ How did he know any money was gone unless he was the one who\nkilled old Jonathan and took it for himself?”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Why, dash it all,\nguv’nor, how on earth can an aerodrome disappear?”\n\nDixon Hawke and his young assistant were sitting at a large, flat-topped\ndesk examining a package of diagrams and reports which had just been\nbrought in.\n\nHawke, having read through the reports, now proceeded to give a concise\naccount of how matters stood in regard to the mystery of the aerodrome\nwhich had vanished.\n\n“Most forms of air smuggling are profitable,” said the detective, “and\nthe most profitable of all is undoubtedly the smuggling of aliens in and\nout of the country.\n\n“It is in that dangerous department of the game that a red cabin\nbiplane, which has come to be known as the Scarlet Runner, is suspected\nof being involved.”\n\nThe detective paused to study one of the diagrams.\n\n“A machine which answered to the description of the Scarlet Runner,”\nHawke went on, “was forced down through lack of petrol at Burfort\nAerodrome the evening before last.\n\n“It bore a Dutch registration number, and the pilot, who wore heavy\ngoggles, spoke with a faint foreign accent.\n\n“One of the mechanics at the petrol pumps hurried into the aerodrome\nhotel and informed Flight-Lieutenant Blake, the manager of the\naerodrome.\n\n“Blake came out and requested the pilot of the red plane to give an\naccount of himself. The pilot assured him that he was on perfectly\nlegitimate private work, but was not in a position to give details\nwithout consulting his employer.\n\n“When Blake talked about detaining him, he protested that he was overdue\nand urgently expected. He had not much farther to go, and offered to\ntake Blake with him for an interview with his employer.\n\n“Blake remained obdurate for a while, but the mystery pilot persisted.\nHe would fly Blake back to Burfort within a short space of time. His\nerrand, he pleaded, was one of life and death.\n\n“At this,” continued Hawke, “the aerodrome manager gave way and\nconsented to travel in the red plane, which a few minutes later, when\ndarkness was falling, took off and bore him westwards.”\n\nOnce more the criminologist abstractedly flicked over the papers before\nhim.\n\n“Yes?” queried Tommy. “What then?”\n\n“That was the last time Flight-Lieutenant Blake was seen alive. His\nbody, with the skull fractured, was found at Bristol in a lorry.”\n\n“In a lorry?”\n\n“Yes; the lorry had returned half laden from London through Burfort, and\nin the general direction taken by the red plane. The driver had stopped\nat a village called Nestol, about fifteen miles west of Burfort, to take\na nap. He pulled on to a grass verge on a lonely road for the purpose,\nand it was evidently whilst he was sleeping that the body was put on the\nlorry.”\n\n“Then,” said Tommy, “the red plane must have landed somewhere near\nNestol?”\n\n“Indeed it must. The lorry driver awoke from his nap and proceeded on\nhis way shortly after dark. According to the time he gave, he left\nNestol about half an hour after the red plane took off from Burfort.\n\n“Within that half hour, Tommy, the plane landed, Blake was murdered, and\nhis body carried or driven to the lorry, which presumably the murderer\nor murderers made use of on impulse.” “It’s pretty obvious, then,\nguv’nor, that the landing-ground must be somewhere pretty close to where\nthat lorry was?”\n\nHawke nodded.\n\n“Now we come to that part of the case which strikes me as really\nremarkable,” he said. “I mean the matter of the disappearing flying\nfield.”\n\n“That part of the country,” he continued, “is very rugged. Grassy knolls\nand ancient earthworks abound. There aren’t more than half a dozen level\nfields within a radius of five miles of Nestol, and those are almost too\nsmall to warrant the name of fields. Not one of them is a practicable\nlanding-place.”\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Pilot’s Perplexity\n\nTOMMY pointed to the plan which Hawke had spread before him. “What about\nthis small flying field that one of the Burfort pilots says he located?”\n\n“Exactly, Tommy! What about it? Flying-Officer Thurlow has come forward\nto say that he was heading east towards Burfort a week before this\naffair when he saw a square field, just big enough for a landing and\ntakeoff, which was, apparently, in use as a private flying field, for\nthere was a wind indicator flying in one corner of it.\n\n“He was able to memorise its locality roughly from the position of a\nwater-tower and that of the village of Nestol. When he took a flight to\ntry to locate it yesterday, however, he failed. Not only was there not a\nfield large enough, but there wasn’t one bearing the slightest\nresemblance to the one he had seen—or thought he had seen.”\n\n“Why do you admit that bit, sir? D’you think he might have dreamt of\nthat flying field?”\n\n“His superiors seem inclined to think that. He himself is quite\nbewildered about it. Claims to be rather good at spotting and memorising\nlandmarks.”\n\n“What about the district inquiries? Have the local police been able to\ncollect any information?”\n\nHawke shook his head.\n\n“There are only one or two scattered houses in the vicinity, and the\nrange of vision of their occupants is restricted by the hilly nature of\nthe ground. The house nearest to the spot where Thurlow thought the\nflying field was is occupied by the brothers Fred and Walter Morton,\nsmall farmers, who are assisted by a deaf-and-dumb cowman and a couple\nof plough hands.\n\n“The farmer brothers are not helpful towards the local police, who have\napparently pulled them up for minor breaches of agricultural\nregulations. The ploughmen live, with their wives, in two small cottages\nat the back of the farmhouse, and they are also a bit on the sullen side\nwhere the police are concerned. Nobody has troubled to interrogate the\ndeaf-and-dumb cowhand, who sleeps in an attic bedroom in the farmhouse.”\n\nHaving thus outlined the story he had gleaned from the reports, Hawke\nsat musing for a while, and then, becoming suddenly brisk, instructed\nTommy to pack his suitcase and get the car out.\n\n“We’ll go to Burfort Aerodrome and start from there,” he said. “We’ll go\nover the ground that’s been covered, and see if we can spot anything\nthat the local police may have missed.”\n\nTwenty minutes later they were on their way out of London, and in a\nlittle under two hours were at Burfort, one of the smaller of the\nprovincial aerodromes.\n\nHaving booked rooms at the aerodrome hotel, Hawke introduced himself to\nFlying-Officer Thurlow.\n\n“I’ve heard of you, of course, Mr. Hawke,” said Thurlow. “D’you know,\nit’s occurred to me that they ought to get someone like you on this\njob.”\n\n“What about this flying field that vanished?” asked Hawke, coming\nstraight to the point.\n\nThurlow frowned slightly.\n\n“There’s only one possible explanation,” he said, “and that isn’t what\nsome people think. I’m not romancing, and I didn’t dream it. I\ndefinitely saw the aerodrome, but it’s possible that I miscalculated the\nlocality. It’s easy for an inexperienced flyer to be thirty miles out in\nhis map reading.\n\n“But,” added the young pilot in emphatic tones. “I don’t admit that I am\nall that inexperienced. Furthermore, I positively made a mental note of\nthe position of the field relative to that water tower and the village\nof Nestol.\n\n“If,” added Thurlow, “ it transpires that there’s another water-tower\nand another village some miles west of Nestol, I suppose I shall have to\naccept it that I have made an error. But it will be the first time I\never have made such an error.”\n\n“Supposing you take us for a flight over this district?” suggested\nHawke.\n\n“Good idea,” assented Thurlow energetically. “Come on. I can get a cabin\nmonoplane right away.”\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Fruitless Flight\n\nHawke and Tommy were presently sitting behind Thurlow in a low-winged,\nfive-seater monoplane with twin engines.\n\nFrom the cabin windows an almost unrestricted view was obtainable of the\nmosaic pattern of the landscape below.\n\nA few minutes’ flying brought them within sight of a cylindrical steel\nstructure which Thurlow pointed out as the water-tower to which he had\nalluded, and of a cluster of houses constituting the village of Nestol.\n\nHawke, an amateur airman of considerable experience, turned a discerning\neye on the fields immediately beneath them. They showed the contours of\nearthworks, indicating their hopeless unevenness as potential\nlanding-grounds. Many had trees in the middle.\n\nThurlow presently pointed to a cluster of half a dozen fields, two of\nwhich were ploughed.\n\n“That’s Morton’s farm,” he said. “You can just see the farmhouse through\nthe trees there.”\n\nHawke perceived at a glance that none of the fields here, though level\nenough, were of the size or shape suitable for a flying field. The two\nfields nearest the house were long and narrow, divided by a hedge.\n\nA landing down either of these strips of land, across which the\nprevailing winds blew, would have been disastrous.\n\n“I could have sworn it was round about there that I saw that flying\nfield,” declared Thurlow’. “Can’t make it out.”\n\nAt Hawke’s suggestion, they flew’ on for another twenty-five miles or\nso.\n\nStill having failed to find any landmarks corresponding to those around\nNestol—or anything resembling a flying field—they turned and flew back\nto Burfort.\n\n“Well?” demanded Thurlow, “what are you going to do next?”\n\n“Nothing very brilliant,” answered Hawke. “Repeat the police inquiries,\nand just hope that someone will be able to put us on the track of the\nScarlet Runner. Come on, Tommy. Get the car. We’ll drive over to\nNestol.”\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nAn Amiable Reception\n\nHalf an hour later the detective’s car drew to a standstill outside the\nwhite -washed, thatched-roofed village inn at Nestol, and Hawke got out\nto inquire the way to the Morton’s farm.\n\nHe paused for a moment at the doorway of the inn and listened.\n\nThen he beckoned to Tommy.\n\n“Judging by the conversation,” he said, “one of the Morton brothers is\nin here.”\n\nThe two went into the bar parlour, from where they could hear voices in\nthe taproom.\n\n“‘Don’t Mister Morton me,’ I says,” remarked one of the voices. “‘I\nknows my rights,’ I says, ‘ and I ain’t ’avin’ you snoopin’ round my\nfarm looking for airplanes, an’ frightenin’ my pigs, Mister P.C.\nbloomin’ Coombes.’ ” Which statement was greeted with hearty guffaws,\nand the red-faced landlord was wiping away tears of mirth from his eyes\nwhen he came through to attend to the new callers’ requirements.\n\n“I came to inquire my way to the Morton farm,” said Hawke. “Is that one\nof the Mortons in there?”\n\n“Yes—ee-hee!—’e’s a lad. You ain’t after that airyplane, too, are ye,\nsir?” Hawke handed over his card, and requested that it should be passed\non to the Mr. Morton in the taproom.\n\n“I suppose you haven’t seen anything of this red aeroplane?” inquired\nthe detective.\n\nThe landlord shook his head.\n\n“Everybody’s talkin’ about it, but, bless you, with all they airplanes\ngoin’, over Burfort nowadays we never takes no notice of ’em.”\n\n“Yes, quite,” commented Hawke impatiently. “Ask Mr. Morton if I might\nhave a word with him, will you?”\n\nThe landlord waddled through the stone-floored passage to the taproom,\nstaring down at the visiting card which he held before him.\n\n“If Morton won’t help the local police, guv’nor,” murmured Tommy, “I\ndon’t suppose we’ll get much change out of him. These fellows don’t like\nLondoners at the best of times.”\n\nHawke nodded.\n\n“We’ll try tact,” he whispered.\n\n“Yes, sir. Buy him a quart of it!” Both were surprised to discover that\nthey had wrongly estimated the situation.\n\nMr. Fred Morton, a big, powerful, iron-jawed man, came through and\nintroduced himself. He looked capable of being awkward—extremely\nawkward. But he didn’t choose to be.\n\n“No, sir,” he said, holding up his palm at Hawke’s invitation. “I’ll be\nhost. Only too pleased. Do all I can to help you, sir. Take you right up\nto my place, I will, and show you the lay of the land. ’Fraid you won’t\nfind no trace of this missin’ plane, though, but, as I say, I’ll be\npleased to help.”\n\nThe farmer requested the landlord to supply everyone in the taproom with\nrefreshment at his expense, and Hawke sipped at a tankard of ale for the\nsake of politeness. He was on the alert, and anxious not to allow the\nconvivial atmosphere of the inn to take the edge off his powers of\nperception.\n\nAt the first opportunity, therefore, he hurried Mr. Morton outside, and\nthey were presently driving towards the farm.\n\nOn arrival, Morton introduced the visitors to his brother, who had been\ntrying out a powerful motor-tractor in one of the fields.\n\nWalter was equally amiable, but the sharp-eyed Hawke noticed that he\nfirst exchanged significant glances with his brother.\n\nThe brothers led the visitors along the side of the hedge dividing the\ntwo narrow, slightly misshapen fields to the stockyard, near which was a\nlarge, open granary—a framework of steel girders supporting a corrugated\niron roof, and housing a large haystack.\n\n“These fields ain’t large enough for a machine to land,” remarked Fred.\n\nHawke murmured his agreement, and as he did so there was a cry from\nTommy.\n\nTurning, Hawke perceived that the youth had gone sprawling over a small\ntrolley, which he had not noticed in the fading light.\n\nIt was a small platform on rollers, handleless, and no more than six\ninches high and a couple of feet square—the kind of thing used in goods\nstations for slipping under heavy packing-casts.\n\nAfter the youth had picked himself up and brushed his soiled clothes\nwith his hands, the party proceeded on their tour of inspection, the\nincident temporarily forgotten.\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nHawke Thinks It Over\n\nTHE visit to the farm, which proved quite unfruitful, lasted about half\nan hour, after which Hawke and Tommy returned to the car and drove out\nof the village towards the main road.\n\n“Stop the car, Tommy,” said Hawke before they reached the latter. “I\nwant to sit back and do a little quiet thinking.”\n\nThe youngster drew the car in to the side of the road and stopped the\nengine. Silence reigned for three or four minutes.\n\n“Why,” asked the detective presently, “should the Mortons refuse the\ncountry constable access to their farm, and yet welcome a London\ndetective with open arms?”\n\n“Because they had a grudge against the local police.”\n\n“That is one explanation. Are there other possible explanations? Our job\nis to examine them all.”\n\nTommy agreed.\n\n“Assume for a moment,” proceeded Hawke, “that the Mortons did have some\nguilty secret to hide.”\n\n“That would explain their being awkward to the local police,” said\nTommy, “but it wouldn’t explain their being so helpful to the London\ndetective, who, presumably, has a more highly-trained eye.”\n\n“Ah! Now, wait a minute, young man,” said Hawke, with a sudden show of\nenthusiasm for the discussion. “You’ve touched on an interesting point\nthere. Isn’t it possible that these fellows have a supreme contempt for\nthe intelligence of townsmen?”\n\n“H’m! I’ve often noticed that country fellows are that way inclined.”\n\n“Aid with justice, Tommy.”\n\nThere was a gleam in the detective’s eye as he continued:\n\n“Out of his own element, the townsman is not such a smart fellow. He\ndoesn’t know the difference between a heifer and a steer, or between –\nBy Jove! ”\n\nHawke broke off abruptly and lapsed into another thoughtful silence.\n\n“Or between what, guv’nor?”\n\n“Between a hawthorn hedge and a blackthorn hedge.”\n\n“But what—”\n\n“Listen, Tommy! A few facts are beginning to line up. Was Fred Morton\nafraid of P.C. Coombes, the country policeman, spotting something which\nhe was confident we would not spot?”\n\nTommy frowned.\n\n“I can’t think of anything which would have any bearing on the missing\naerodrome.”\n\n“I can.”\n\nHawke gripped Tommy’s arm.\n\n“It’s only a very small, very poor, sort of farm, and there are two of\nthem sharing it. Yet you noticed how free Fred Morton was with his\nmoney?”\n\n“That’s one fact, certainly,’’ agreed Tommy. “Any others?”\n\n“Yes. You are bearing a reminder of one of them on your shin.”\n\n“The trolley affair? But what connection could that have with the\naeroplane?”\n\n“What connection could it have with anything? What was it doing there?\nCome on, turn the car round. I want to make a little investigation.”\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nThe Artificial Hedge\n\nHawke and Tommy left the car some distance from the entrance to the\nfarm, and proceeded across the fields on foot.\n\nVery cautiously they approached the hedge near which the trolley had\nstood, and, kneeling down, Hawke flashed on his pocket torch.\n\nThe yellow beam revealed the bases of two light hurdle fences, into\nwhich were interwoven the twigs and small branches constituting the\nhedge.\n\n“That’s what the countryman would have noticed, Tommy. It’s hedged but\nnot ditched.”\n\nHawke stood up and leaned his weight on the hedge, which yielded\nslightly along a length of about five yards on either side of him.\n\n“It’s in sections,” whispered the detective. “Untie the sections, and,\nwith a couple of those trolleys and that tractor, they can be towed away\nto the side of the field in no time, leaving the square field that\nThurlow saw. Just large enough for a flying field.” Tommy gasped at this\nrevelation.\n\n“What an inspiration, guv’nor! But where would the plane be hidden?”\n\n“I have a theory about that. Let’s test it.”\n\nThey hurried on to the granary, where Hawke, after searching about for a\nmoment, found a pitchfork.\n\n“That one stroke of ingenuity suggests another,” he said, thrusting the\npitchfork into the end of the huge hayrick. “Seeing that their thoughts\nrun in the direction of camouflage, it’s possible that this rick isn’t\nall that it appears to be.”\n\nBang!\n\nThe bullet, which went past their ears with a sound like the crack of a\nwhip, caused both to drop to the ground and scramble for cover behind\nthe rick.\n\nA second and a third shot, coming from the other side of the stockyard,\nprovoked the worried lowing of cattle, the clucking of fowl, and the\nwhole repertoire of farmyard noises.\n\nThe two detectives also heard the sound of running feet, and excited\nvoices in stage-whisper debate.\n\nOne of the voices, that of Fred Morton, said: “We never bargained for\nall this ’ere, I tell you.”\n\n“Perhaps, my friend,” answered a guttural voice, “you are bargaining for\nprison all your life? Or the firing squad, hein? Do what you are told.\nRound that way. They must not escape!”\n\nWith their attackers approaching them from either side of the rick, it\nseemed that their only course was to break for the open—and that would\nalmost certainly be fatal. They would be shot down before they had gone\na dozen paces.\n\nHawke grabbed Tommy by both arms, and half-lifted him on to the lower\nrungs of a ladder which leaned against the rick.\n\nThe youth was quick to appreciate the position, and he was on top of the\nrick in a flash.\n\nHawke was not far behind him, heaving his body over just as another shot\nrang out from below.\n\nThere was a low murmur of indistinguishable conversation for a moment,\nand then the rustle of hay.\n\nA cautious glimpse over the edge revealed three shadowy figures engaged\nin hauling bales of hay from the end of the rick.\n\nIn a very short space Hawke’s suspicions about the rick were proved to\nhave been well founded. The rick was built up like a house, rough cubes\nof hay being used instead of bricks, or blocks of stone.\n\nThe two could feel the hollow rick sag slightly as the major part of its\nend wall was removed, and presently a plane, with wings folded back\nagainst its sides, was wheeled out into the yard.\n\nThe wings were swung out into position and the engine started.\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nEscape from the Flames\n\nTwo of the figures rushed across to the rick, and in a few seconds there\nwas a loud crackling sound below, distinguishable even above the\nsplutter of the ticking engine.\n\nGreat volumes of smoke rose up, almost choking Hawke and Tommy.\n\n“We can’t get down. They’ve taken the ladder,” shouted Tommy.\n\nThe rick took fire with such rapidity that they were in the midst of an\ninferno before any plan of action occurred to them.\n\nIndeed, there seemed no alternative between being burned alive or\njumping to the ground and being shot, if they didn’t break their necks.\nFollowing a swift glance about him in the light of the flames, Hawke\nshouted to Tommy: “Jump for that crossbar.”\n\nBoth reached the bar which spanned the underside of the roof, and swung\ntheir legs over it, but the move was very much like jumping from the\nfrying pan into the fire. The roof was a trap for the clouds of smoke,\nand terrific waves of heat were thrown at them both from below and\nabove.\n\nInstinctively they moved towards the ends of the crossbar.\n\nTommy reached one of the upright girders.\n\nIt was almost unbearably hot, but, shutting his eyes and holding his\nbreath, he slid down through a solid wall of flame, fell the last few\nfeet, and rolled out into the open, his flesh blistered and his clothes\nburning.\n\nHawke, who had made a desperate jump for it and luckily landed on a heap\nof loose hay which had not yet caught fire, ran to his assistant’s aid,\nand dragged him to a water-pump a few yards away.\n\nThe fire brigade, which presently arrived, found, in addition to a\nburning haystack, the wreckage of the Scarlet Runner in one of the\nnarrow fields. There were three men inside it, two dead and one mortally\ninjured.\n\nBefore he died in the local hospital, Fred Morton told how he had been\napproached by the foreigner, who had introduced himself as Dr. Albrecht\nBirt, and offered more money per week than the farm had ever yielded per\nyear.\n\nIt was a matter of giving facilities for a secret aerodrome, and the\nbrothers agreed to the foreigner’s proposition, tempted by the money and\nbecause they “didn’t see much harm in it.” They bribed the hands to keep\nquiet about the portable hedge.\n\nDr. Birt, head of a band of foreign spies, had killed Blake on arrival\nat the farm, and had forced them to help in the disposal of the body by\nplaying on their fears of punishment for high treason.\n\nThe foreigner was going to fly off, leaving the brothers to explain the\nfiring of the rick and the deaths of Hawke and Tommy as an accident.\n\nThey were scared, however, and forced their way into the plane with Dr.\nBirt.\n\nThere had been no time to remove the fake hedge, and the heavy load\nfrustrated Birt’s attempt at a trick takeoff across the air current.\n\nThe ending of the mystery of the disappearing aerodrome proved the\nbeginning of a new and very successful spy cleanup.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n\nOne of the most ingenious escapes-from-punishment-through-a-loophole-in-the-law ever to be\nrecorded was worked late in the preceding century by a man named William\nF. Howe, who was easily one of the most successful criminal lawyers in\nAmerican history. It made Howe more famous than ever, and caused a great\nstate to alter its statutes.\n\nEarly one winter morning, a professional arsonist named Owen Reilly was\nnabbed in the act of setting fire to a row of stores on New York’s lower\nEast Side. Reilly had been earning his living for a number of years by\nperforming this service for eager storekeepers and building owners who\nfelt that they’d get more from the insurance companies than they’d earn\nfrom their properties, and he’d always gotten away with it. This time,\nthough, he was caught red-handed—and it looked as though he was due for\na striped suit.\n\nThe penalty for arson was then life imprisonment. In a panic, Reilly\nscraped up as much money as possible and hired high-priced William F.\nHowe as his attorney.\n\nThe first thing Howe did was to study the evidence in the case and\ndecide that it showed his client to be overwhelmingly guilty. He went\ninto a long, careful huddle with his law books—and then, sadly and with\ndefeat plain on his features, he approached the district attorney and\nthe judge assigned to the case.\n\nHe heaved a deep sigh. “This is one time I’ve got to admit I’m licked,”\nhe said. “Caught in the act! What’s a defense attorney supposed to be—a\nmiracle worker?’\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and turned to the district attorney. “Look,”\nhe said, “there’s no point in spending the State’s money for lengthy\ntrials and arguments, and there’s no point in wasting my time any more\nthan necessary. If you’ll change the charge from committed arson to\nattempted arson, we’ll agree to plead guilty. That’s a fair enough\ncompromise: you’ll save trial expenses, and my client will get off with\na lighter sentence.”\n\nHowe was famous for his amazing courtroom tricks, and the district\nattorney should have known better than to agree. But this looked like a\nsimple enough proposition, and a way to save the State some money—the\nD.A. agreed. Shortly thereafter, the trial judge concurred.\n\nOwen Reilly pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted arson, and, after\ndue proceedings, was asked to stand and receive sentence. It was then\nthat Howe sprung his bombshell.\n\n“Just a minute, Your Honor,” Howe said, rushing up to the bench. “Reilly\nneedn’t bother standing—he’s a free man.”\n\nThe judge and the district attorney stared at the criminal lawyer in\nastonishment. “Have you gone crazy?” the D.A. snapped.\n\n“Not at all,” Howe said, blandly.\n\n“I’ve just been reading my law books, that’s all…”\n\n“If you’ll read yours, Mr. District Attorney, you’ll find that the\nspecified sentence for any crime attempted but not actually committed is\nhalf the maximum imposed by the law for the actual commission of the\ncrime. But the maximum penalty for the commission of arson is life\nimprisonment.”\n\nHis eyes swept the courtroom, and he grinned impudently. “I defy you,\nMr. D.A., or you, Your Honor, or anyone else in the courtroom, to\nmeasure half a man’s life.” He waved an arm. “Scripture tells us that we\nknoweth not the day nor the hour of our departure. Will you, then,\nsentence the prisoner to half a minute or half the days of Methuselah?”\nThere was a moment of dead silence, then the District Attorney rushed\nover to the judge and began to whisper frantically. But it was no use:\nthe judge had to admit that the measurement of half a man’s life span\nwas beyond the court’s powers.\n\nOwen Reilly left the courtroom a free man, and William F. Howe had\nperformed another miracle of legal juggling. Shortly afterwards, the\nnewspapers carried a story to the effect that the New York State\nLegislature had altered the arson statutes and placed a specific\ntime-sentence on the crime of attempted arson.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

Clean and shiny they were, and\neach one a passport to six months of hell. Two years overseas, and now\nhe was back. He took the curved Japanese dagger out of its wrappings,\nlaid it, bright and terrible across his knees. This was the blade that\nhad been meant for him. Yet he’d lived to bring it home to Saucy Fields,\nbecause his own knife had been quicker.\n\nHe closed his eyes. He wouldn’t think about that now, he would think of\nred-haired Saucy Fields, with her dimples and her twinkling eyes and her\nred, red lips that promised to marry him when the world was sane again.\n\nThe taxi stopped. Terry slung a bill at the driver and jumped out\nwithout even looking. That’s how he happened to be left alone in front\nof the jagged chimney and the black, broken lumber that had once been a\nhome. Terry ran up the weed-crowded walk where two years ago flowers had\ngrown. But there was no use stopping and staring and letting this new\nfear freeze him cold.\n\nHe raced across the memory of a lawn to the house next door, a neat\nlittle white house where the Keslins used to live. It was Mrs. Keslin\nwho answered the pounding.\n\n“Why, Terry Grey, you’re back!”\n\n“Tell me about the fire, tell me about Saucy. Is she all right?”\n\nMrs. Keslin frowned. “You mean Saucy didn’t write you? But perhaps it’s\nno wonder. She was in the hospital a month, and about out of her mind\nwith grief ever since. Her father died in the fire. She’s an orphan now\nand a pauper at that. Mr. Fields didn’t believe in banks you know,\neverything he had burned up.”\n\n“Saucy was in the hospital. Why?”\n\n“Because she was burned, too. Her hand was the worst. They thought at\nfirst she’d lose her left hand, but they say it’ll be all right in time.\nWon’t you come in and sit down, you look terribly tired? How was it in\nthe Pacific?”\n\n“Where is Saucy now, where does she live?”\n\n“At the Y, I believe. She works in the five and ten. It’s about the only\njob she could get with her hand still bandaged and all. She couldn’t\ntype or model or be a nurse, but she can hand out rouge and lipstick and\nmake change. They’re so hard up for help. Terry!” Mrs. Keslin screamed\nafter the flying figure. “Terry Grey, you haven’t told me one word about\nthe Pacific!”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nNo Admittance\n\nThe five and dime was crowded. Women seethed through the swinging doors,\nstood six deep around the candy counter, and about as thick at the\ncosmetics. And there was a woman screaming here, too. Almost as loudly\nas Mrs. Keslin had screamed, only the words weren’t the same. They were\nquick and wild with hysteria:\n\n“I laid it down for just a minute! It was in a brown box. It’s worth\nthree hundred dollars!”\n\n“I’m sorry, madam, we can’t be responsible for lost articles.”\n\n“Lost? It was stolen! That girl stole it!”\n\nThere wasn’t a sound in all the store. No one asked for candy, no one\nwent out the doors. They just stood like lumps of putty staring at the\naccusing finger, at the red-haired girl it pointed to. The breath\nwhooshed out of Terry Grey’s lungs. He had come home to Saucy Fields,\nthe one he loved, and to the man standing beside her, Pat Munsen, the\none he hated.\n\nMunsen was tall and thin, so thin the bones stuck out on his cheeks like\nthe twin crossbars to giant T’s. There were sunken, dark circles under\nhis eyes, and he looked like death. None of it was necessary. He’d gone\non a hunger strike when the draft was first announced. He hadn’t had a\nsquare meal since, just enough to keep him alive. He’d been quite proud\nabout it, boasting to all the boys they could go out and march and crawl\nand die, but he’d stay home and live.\n\nAnd he had. He was a walking skeleton, but he was home and alive. A lot\nof Terry Grey’s friends weren’t. Pat Munsen smiled and patted the lady\ncustomer on the shoulder. He had on yellow suede gloves. There was a\nbrown coat over his arm and a brown fedora.\n\n“Now, madam. I’m sure there’s some mistake. I’m assistant manager;\nperhaps you’d explain it to me. Just what was it that was lost?”\n\n“Stolen. It was stolen, young man! My family heirloom teapot, three\nhundred dollars it’s worth. I was taking it down to the antique show. I\nstopped in to buy some lipstick, and laid the box on the counter. This\ngirl just a minute after took a lot of boxes from here and went through\nthat door. When I turned around my teapot box was gone. She took it, I\ntell you! She took it and ran away with it!”\n\n“But I didn’t run away, I came back!” Saucy was so white, so very white.\nThere were tears in her eyes.\n\nPat Munsen frowned. “Where were you going with the boxes, Miss Fields?”\n\n“Up to the stockroom. I’d just brought them down and they were the wrong\nkind. They were all lipstick when we needed rouge. So I took them back\nup and got the rouge. I never once touched her old teapot or even saw\nit!”\n\nThe lady customer bounced, as though she had been a rubber ball she\nbounced. The two red spots in her cheeks grew redder.\n\n“I want the police, I want my teapot!”\n\nShe grabbed at the counter, started throwing things. A bottle of perfume\ncrashed on the floor. Another hit the edge of the counter, splashed on\nPat Munsen’s neatly turned vest, left a dark, wet stain.\n\n“See here! Lady, stop that!” The man who pushed through the crowd was\nshort and fat, and had two eyes bright as parrots. “I’m Mr. Lighman,\nmanager of the store. Madam, if you will just be quiet a minute!”\n\nShe was, as quiet as a woman can be crying into her handkerchief. Mr.\nLighman frowned.\n\n“What is this, Munsen?”\n\n“The lady has lost a silver teapot. She thinks Miss Fields took it\nupstairs with some boxes of stock.”\n\n“Did you?”\n\n“No, sir.” Saucy was very sure, very defiant.\n\n“Go bring the boxes back, let the lady look for himself.”\n\nSaucy Fields left the counter, her chin high, her eyes black with anger.\nThe crowd parted to let her through. Terry could see the door she was\nheading toward. It was closed. There was no admittance on it, and a fire\naxe shackled to the wall beside it. Saucy was almost there. Once on the\nother side of that door she would be alone. Terry had waited two years\nto be alone with Saucy; he wasn’t going to wait any longer. He slid\nquietly along the edge of the crowd, closer and closer to the door\nswinging shut behind Saucy Fields.\n\nThen that mad, fool woman was screaming again. “Go after her! Don’t let\nher go alone! She’ll hide my teapot, and we’ll never see it!”\n\nFor a minute all eyes had turned back to the hysterical customer. No one\nsaw Terry Grey grab the door and pull it open. But the woman did. Oh,\nshe couldn’t miss that, the door opening, and Terry Grey sneaking\nthrough with the Japanese dagger still cold and bright and forgotten in\nhis hand.\n\n“Merciful heavens, look at that knife!”\n\nLook they did. A whole store full of people, to make it quite plain to\nthe police afterwards that a young soldier, a sergeant with brown hair\nand a white scar across the back of his neck, went inside the No\nAdmittance door carrying a dagger. The same dagger found by the bodies\nnot five minutes later.\n\nThe stair well was dark. Dark, narrow, very steep, and filled with\nsmells, cabbage and onions and boiling soup. A thousand nauseous whiffs\nof a thousand ancient meals hung there in that locked passage. Terry\ntook the stairs three at a time. Still there was no sign of Saucy. On\nthe top landing there were four black doors and a white-faced time\nclock. For just a moment Terry hesitated, which way?\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nFour Minutes\n\nSuddenly there were feet on the stairs below. Mr. Lighman’s old, high\nvoice, “Snap the bolt on that door, Munsen, and stay on guard. I’ll go\nto the safe and get my gun. We’ll stop that soldier going any harm with\nthat knife of his. “The idea of the Army letting a boy wander around\nloose with a weapon like that! I don’t know what the world is coming\nto!”\n\nThe world was falling, at least Terry Grey’s was. He had turned quickly\ntoward the nearest door. He didn’t see the pencil lying on the floor. It\nrolled under his foot, sent him flying back down those dark, steep\nstairs. It was strange how lie wasn’t frightened; it was all too quick,\ntoo unreal. He remembered noticing the time, five of two. He remembered\nhow Mr. Lighman screamed. And that was all.\n\nIt was the pain in his head that bothered him most when he awoke. The\npain in his heart and the aching in his arms. Then it was his heart. The\nway it wouldn’t beat, the way he couldn’t breathe. For he was looking at\nMr. Lighman crumpled by the door at the foot of the stairs. They were\nall three there, at least their bodies were, for Mr. Lighman was dead.\n\nHe had to be dead. There was blood all over him, and on the walls and\nfloor. And Pat Munsen was lying in the blood, with the Japanese dagger\nstill sticking into his side.\n\nTerry Grey crawled up the stairs. He couldn’t stand upright, not with\nthe nausea, and he couldn’t stay back there. Not with the screeching on\nthe other side of the door.\n\n“Look at the blood! Look at the blood seeping over the sill!” As though\nit were an exclamation point, the fire axe bit a piece out of the center\npanel, then another and another. Finally Terry reached the top landing\nwith its three doors and the clock. It was just then one minute to two.\n\nOnly four minutes had passed. Four minutes to bathe his hands in red.\nThe screaming was louder and the pounding. It had to be murder; there\nwere too many blows for an accident. He could see the blood on his\nhands.\n\nThe door beside him opened. Saucy Fields was standing there with her\nboxes and with the wonder of a smile just dawning on her lips. The\ndistant pounding of the axe stopped. A man’s voice cut through the\nsilence:\n\n“Shut the store and call the police! That crazy soldier has killed Mr.\nLighman and Mr. Munsen!”\n\nThe smile twisted into agony.\n\n“No! No, Terry! No!” When she fainted, Saucy Fields’ eyes were on Terry\nGrey’s red-streaked hands.\n\nThe soldier darted into the stockroom, he ran now with fleet, cunning\nfeet. There wasn’t time to stop and think, he had to get away. He had to\nhide before those feet pounding on the stairs caught up with him.\n\nThe stockroom was cold, and as poorly lighted as the stairs. It was a\nhuge cavern laced with a maze of narrow passages between boxlike shelves\non either side, hundreds and hundreds of shelves higher than a man’s\nhead, filled with china and toys and nameless cartons. There was yet\nanother smell in here, like a clear, sharp cloud, the odor of mothballs.\n\nTerry Grey ran to the very back of the room, to a red exit sign. He was\nclear out on the fire escape when he saw the police below. So he didn’t\ngo down and he didn’t go up. He went back, back into the dismal shadows\nand the cold, tart smell of mothballs.\n\nThere were people in the stockroom now, stealthy, whispering people\ncoming closer and closer. He climbed one of the sets of shelves,\ncarefully, slowly, past dozens and dozens of china cups. One or two\nrattled. It was like thunder in his ear. But he reached the top and slid\nin that small, dark space between the ceiling and the shelves.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nBlood On His Hands\n\nFor an hour men searched. They threw caution away and cursed. They\nbrought flashlights and looked into every corner. One even suggested\nthey hunt on top of the shelf cabinets as well as in them.\n\n“In that little crack? No man could squeeze in there.”\n\nSo they left it alone. They didn’t know what a man could learn on a\nbattlefield. They didn’t know what a man could do with another’s blood\non his hands.\n\nIt was worse after the searchers left. Much worse. Because then he could\nthink, he could remember, all those loud, vengeful voices:\n\n“That girl called him Terry. Find out what soldier she knows by the name\nof Terry, and plaster his pictures in all the papers. We’ll find him,\nsomeone will turn him in.”\n\n“The Munsen guy’s going to live. The doc says the knife just grazed his\nribs, so it’s only one murder we’ve got against this Terry.”\n\n“You can hang as high for one as you can for two.”\n\n“What ever made the dope do it?”\n\n“There was something about a silver teapot being stolen.”\n\n“Hell, no, that damn fool woman found it where she left it, on the\nNotions counter.”\n\nWords. Beating through the silence. Pounding on a man’s brain. Words\ntumbling in a kaleidoscope of horror, and always coming back the same,\n“You can hang a man as high for one, as two.”\n\nTerry Grey lay there, hour after hour, until it was night. He saw the\nwindows at the far end of the stockroom grow grey, then black and white\nagain when the movie across the street lighted its twinkling sign.\n\nThat’s where he ought to be, out there at the movies with Saucy. Only he\nwas in here, going crazy, wondering why he had killed a man he didn’t\nknow, and only tried to kill the man he hated. Perhaps hate wasn’t the\nword, perhaps contempt would be better. Contempt and fear that somehow\nPat might get Saucy away from him. Two years was a long time to remember\na guy you didn’t see.\n\nOnly she had seen him, with blood on his hands.\n\nTerry Grey buried his face in his arms. And he kept rubbing his hands on\nthe ball of excelsior he’d picked off the floor. The blood was gone from\nhis fingers long ago, but he could still feel it.\n\nPretty soon he’d have to surrender to the police. It was the only thing\nhe could do. He’d thought it all over here alone with himself in the\ndark. There would be no more peace for him, not ever again. Not with Mr.\nLighman’s scream growing louder and louder in his ears.\n\nTerry wondered which scream it was this one echoing over and over. Was\nit that first scream when Terry began falling, or was it another scream\nwhen Mr. Lighman died?\n\nThat was the odd part. Terry couldn’t remember, he couldn’t remember\nusing the knife and he thought he ought to. It wasn’t easy pushing a\nknife in and out of a human body. He knew. That was how he got the damn\ndagger in the beginning, only that was war and this was murder.\n\nIf only he could prove he hadn’t done it! He didn’t care about the rest\nof the world. He just wanted to prove it to himself, and to Saucy\nFields.\n\nTerry Grey climbed down from his high roost; soft as a cat he hunted for\nthe stockroom door. He’d have to be careful, there’d be a watchman,\nsomewhere about there’d be an old man with a flashlight and keys and a\ngun. That was a chance Terry had to take. He had to get to the hall\nagain and look at those stairs. He wanted to see what a man could do in\nfour minutes of time.\n\nTerry had a couple of books of matches in his pockets. They helped find\nthe door, they also showed him the place where the candles were stored,\nlong ones and short ones, altar candles and table candles and birthday\ncandles. He chose an altar candle in a red glass jar, because that way\nthere’d be no drip. There also was very little light. Just a halo about\nhis hand, and all that dark, silent store crowding down about him.\n\nThe clock said twenty after eleven. Terry looked at it close to be sure,\nthen ran down the stairs as fast, as softly as he could. He stood there\nin the dark at the bottom and lit the candle again. The blood was brown\nnow. The jagged holes in the door black.\n\nHe cut at the air, over and over he slashed with the knife that wasn’t\nin his hand. Then he ran back up the stairs, careful to keep on the\nsoft, padded part of them. He held the candle close to the white-faced\nclock, twenty-three minutes past eleven. So there had been time. Someone\ncould have come down, killed, and gone back up again. It would have been\npossible, but it would have been so dose. Too close.\n\nHow could anyone on the spur of the moment discover that dagger and use\nit to such advantage! It couldn’t be. Minds didn’t work that fast.\nBesides there was no motive. It had to be Terry Grey. He leaned low over\nthe candle and his shadow was a giant touching him on the shoulder. The\nfirst cut had been an accident, slicing into Mr. Lighman as Terry fell,\nand the rest madness. Terry had drawn blood. With the smell of it in his\nnostrils he had gone crazy, like a wild animal in the jungle. That was\nthe way it must have been. There was nothing left except to say good-by\nto Saucy Fields.\n\nHe tried all the doors. The first was the girls’ cloak room, the second\nthe kitchens, and the third was the office, a large windowless room with\nseveral desks in it, a wired cage, and an old- fashioned safe. There was\na telephone on the desk beside the safe, and a telephone book.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Ten Thousand Dollars\n\nThe voice at the Y was young, impersonal until he asked for Miss Fields.\nIt hesitated for just a minute. “Who’s calling?”\n\nTerry knew there was danger here. He could feel it coming over the wire,\nthe guarded way the girl spoke, that long moment when she hadn’t spoken\nat all.\n\n“I said, who’s calling?”\n\n“Tell her it’s an old friend of her father’s. A Mr. Beanie.” Beanie was\na dog Terry had owned once in the long ago when he was a little boy and\nSaucy a little girl. Saucy would remember, she had cried as hard as\nTerry the day old Beanie died.\n\n“Hello, Mr. Beanie?” She was breathless. Her voice was so soft and warm,\nit was something a man could dream of, as he had dreamed of it for two\nyears.\n\n“Hello, Saucy, I want to say good-bye.”\n\n“But you can’t! You’ve only just home.”\n\n“I know. It’s terrible, because things will never again be the same.”\n\nThat was when she forgot herself.\n\n“No, Terry! They say you killed him, but I know you didn’t. You couldn’t\nhave!”\n\n“I don’t know, Saucy. I don’t know!”\n\n“But I do. You see, I love you.”\n\nFor a moment he thought they’d been cut off, then he knew she was\nwaiting. He could hear little sounds, tiny, moaning sounds like maybe\nshe was crying.\n\n“Thank you, honey, but love isn’t enough. You saw the blood on my hands.\nIt was my knife.”\n\n“But you didn’t take the money. It couldn’t be that there were two\nseparate deliveries going on there that day. That would be stretching\ncoincidence too far. The murder must have been because of the robbery.\nPat had his back to the landing while he fastened the bolt on the door.\nMr. Lighman was the only one who really saw the robber. He was killed\nand Pat only stunned.\n\n“The police have it all figured out, only they say it’s you who took the\nten thousand dollars. How could you? You’d never been there before. You\ncouldn’t have known that the safe was open and no one was in the office.\nYou wouldn’t even have known where the office was.”\n\n“Wait a minute, Saucy! Wait a minute!” He was whispering now. He could\nhear his heart beating in the earphone. “Tell that to me again. What ten\nthousand are you talking of?”\n\n“Why the ten thousand dollars that was in the safe at noon today and\nwasn’t at two o’clock.”\n\nTerry whistled. There was no sound but there were the puckered lips and\nthe air swishing. It blew the candle out. Terry swore. He had used up\none book of matches. Where in hell was the other? He found it in his\nleft hip pocket, dumped it, along with a handful of papers, on the desk.\nThe match burned down to his fingers. He lit another and another. Still\nhe stared.\n\nThose papers he had taken out of his pocket. They were brown, little,\nslim circular bands with numbers on the top of each. $10,00.00. He\npicked them up, one by one. Close over the desk like he was, he could\nsmell them. Perfume.\n\nThey were the sweetest sight, this was the sweetest smell in all the\nworld to him. This smell of murder.\n\nThere was just the slightest of sounds, a whoosh and an infinitesimal\nsqueek. Terry whirled to see the door groove shut. There was a little\nman in front of it, a little man with a very big gun.\n\n“Saucy!” Terry shouted, because there was so little time, and no more\nneed for silence. “Were you near the door in the stockroom? Could you\nsee, did anyone come in just before you went out and met me on the\nlanding?”\n\n“No, Terry, no one came in and no one went in the locker room. There was\na whole bunch of girls in there waiting for the two o’clock bell. No one\nwent in the kitchen. No one went into the office or they would have been\nthere still, because there’s only one way out of the office, back onto\nthe landing and down the stairs with the people watching: through the\nholes the fire axe cut. Don’t you see, that’s why the police are so sure\nit’s you, that’s why you must hide!”\n\n“Listen, Saucy, listen and don’t ever forget. If I should die in the\nnext few minutes,” he looked at that gun coming closer and closer, “if I\nshould never see you again, you can know I didn’t kill Mr. Lighman. I\nwasn’t sure before; I thought I might have done it when I was out of my\nhead, because you see I’ve been trained to kill. The government has\nspent months, day after day it has been pounded into my soul. Kill or be\nkilled.\n\n“Yes, I’ve been taught to kill. But I’ve never been trained to steal.\nConscious or unconscious, I wouldn’t steal. Yet there are money bands in\nmy pocket, empty money bands. I’ve been framed, Saucy, and it’s\nwonderful. I know now I didn’t kill Mr. Lighman. That ten thousands\ndollars has given me back my honor. The fright is gone, Saucy, and the\nfight is just beginning.”\n\nTerry Grey grabbed hold of the telephone cord, swung the earphone in a\nsudden, vicious arc and conked the little gent on the top of his head.\nIt was sudden. It caught the watchman quite unprepared, quite before he\ncould press his finger down on that shiny trigger. He dropped his gun,\nhis lantern, and the keys and crumpled up on top of them. Terry hid the\nunconscious old gent behind one of the desks, then sat down in a swivel\nchair facing the door.\n\nThe police would be there any minute, because of course they had been\nlistening on the phone. They wouldn’t be so dumb as not to tap Saucy’s\nwire. They’d trace the call to the dime store.\n\nThe cops came noisily. First there were the sirens loud enough to make a\ndeaf man scream. Then there was the efficiency, orders here, orders\nthere. At the last, two cops coming up the stairs toward the light. They\nhad guns, and so had Terry Grey.\n\n“Hello.” He smiled. “You took rather longer to get here than I thought.”\n\n“What’s the idea, Grey? Who do you think you are? Put that toy pistol\ndown before you get hurt.”\n\n“It isn’t a toy, and I won’t be the only one to get hurt. If you look,\nyou’ll see a sharpshooter’s medal on my chest.”\n\n“So what? We’re two and you’re one. The store’s lousy with cops.”\n\n“All looking for ten thousand dollars. Suppose I tell you where it\nprobably is?”\n\n“Probably!” It was a sneer. “As if you didn’t know!”\n\n“I don’t, I’m only guessing now.” He held out his left sleeve, showed\nthose four cushioned bars. “Look, that’s two years overseas. Don’t you\nthink it ought to give me a chance to be heard?”\n\nThe police chief hesitated. He leaned close and looked deep into Terry\nGrey’s steady eyes. There was no blinking, no wavering and no fear. The\ncaptain holstered his gun, sat on the edge of the desk.\n\n“O.K. We’ll listen.”\n\n“Perhaps first you’d better smell.” Terry took out the brown paper bands\nwith their printing, with their faint, sweet trace of perfume.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nThe First Step On Your Way To The Chair\n\nThe store opened at nine as usual. Only instead of early business being\nslow, women thronged the store, buying this and that, but mostly passing\nthe door with its jagged holes. They could even see the blood under the\nedge of it. It was something to savor and go home and talk about. And to\nread the morning paper again, where it showed Terry Grey being taken\ninto custody by the police.\n\nThere was a picture of Saucy, and a picture of the woman of the teapot,\nand a picture of poor Mr. Lighman. There was also a picture of the ten\npaper bands from the money that was stolen. The money hadn’t been found\nyet, but the paper said it would be. The police know sure enough how to\nmake a man talk.\n\nThe clerks in the store were pretty much upset. First there was Saucy\nwho hadn’t stayed away like she ought, but came to brazen it out. Then\nthere was Mr. Munsen looking weaker and thinner than ever and walking\nextra slow. Whenever anyone spoke to him he smiled: “Well, the show must\ngo on. Mr. Lighman would want it that way.”\n\nBut mostly Mr. Munsen sat in Mr. Lighman’s chair. You could see he\ndidn’t feel too good. It was five after four when he closed the safe in\nthe office and said good-by to the girls over their books.\n\n“I guess I’ll call it quits. This wound in my side bothers me more than\nI thought it would.”\n\nHe walked out the door slowly. The girls shook their heads as they heard\nhim go miserably down the stairs. Twice on the way down he stopped and\nturned. When he got to the bottom he stopped again. Only now he didn’t\nlook so tired, and there was a screwdriver in his hand.\n\nQuickly he peered through the jagged door, he looked up at the empty\nlanding. Then he flicked the screwdriver under the edge of the carpeting\non the first step. It came up quite easily. Underneath were a lot of\npretty green bills. He gathered them quickly, stuffed them into his coat\npocket. When the last came up, there was some fresh sawdust under it. A\nsmall square of the bare wood step fell out. It wasn’t such a big hole,\nyet there was room enough for the gun poking through and a pair of\nblack, remorseless eyes,\n\n“0.K., Munsen, you can put your hands up now.”\n\nPat Munsen whirled out the door just as a police whistle shrilled. Just\nas the janitor’s supply closet door under the stairs opened, and out\nstepped the police captain and Terry Grey.\n\nMunsen tried to run, but there was no place to go. Plainclothes men\nmaterialized out of the crowd, hemming him in, a thick black circle of\nmen with guns.\n\nTerry shook his bead. “You had already stolen it, hadn’t you, Pat? You\nwere on your way out with your hat and your gloves and your coat. Only\nthat woman made a fuss about her teapot, and I came along with my knife,\nand Mr. Lighman said he was going to the safe for his gun. You couldn’t\nhave him go to the safe, could you? Not with all that money still on\nyou. Not with me there so handy to take the blame. So you killed him.”\n\nTerry laughed, bitterly, sadly. “That could have been enough, only you\nhad to be so sure to blame it on me so you planted the money bands in my\npocket. If you hadn’t, even I wouldn’t have known whether I killed him\nor not. Those bands were in your pocket when the teapot lady threw\nperfume all over your vest. Remember? It was the perfume smell that\npersuaded the police to give me a break. They pretended to arrest me, to\ngive you your chance. All day we’ve waited for you to come for your\nmoney.”\n\n“But how could you know? I hammered the nails back so well with the\nhandle of the dagger. No one could know!”\n\n“How could we help but know? There had only been four minutes. One of\nthose minutes I had been falling downstairs. One of those minutes I had\nbeen crawling upstairs. The two in between were too busy for you to go\nanywhere. It takes time to kill a man, then lie down in his blood and\nstick the knife in your own side. The last took courage.

He stopped the car and Dugan got out. He\nwent into the store, looked at the sign, but that didn’t stop him.\n\n“Any cigarettes?” he asked.\n\n“No cigarettes,” said the man behind the store counter, shaking his\nhead.\n\nDugan went out and reported to Butch.\n\n“They keep them for their friends,” Butch growled. “For people they\nknow.”\n\n“Not always,” said Dugan. “Sometimes they haven’t got them.”\n\nButch roared, “Here, I’ve been going two hours without a smoke! We’ve\nbeen going through one town after another. What do these guys tell us?\nNo cigarettes. All right. I’m going to stage a holdup!”\n\nDugan looked at him, so did the three men in the back. Of course, they\ngot it. Butch’s idea was to walk into a store and demand cigarettes at\nthe point of a gun.\n\n“Don’t do it, Butch,” said Frenchy. “It’s screwy. It ain’t worth it!”\n\n“Don’t do what?”\n\n“Walk into one of these hick stores and ask the guy to come across with\na pack of cigarettes with a gun pointing at him!”\n\n“Who said anything about a hick store?” said Butch. “And who said\nanything about a pack? You guys don’t get it. I ain’t runnin’ no chances\nof sticking up a hick store. And I ain’t after only one pack. Look, you\nbums.” He turned and scowled at them. “A half mile from here we’re out\non the open road. A bus comes along. The bus is filled with passengers.”\n\n“You mean to hold up a bus!” said Dugan.\n\n“That’s exactly what I mean,” said Butch. “Plenty of people and we’ll go\nby the law of averages. Some will have cigarettes and some won’t. But\nthose that have we take.”\n\nThe men in the back leaned back and stared at him. Dugan kept his mouth\nopen. He knew that Butch had all kinds of ideas but this was a little\ndifferent. This was so different that he let out a laugh suddenly. Butch\nkicked him.\n\n“Don’t laugh!” he said. “Ain’t it practical? Ain’t it ah in the kind of\nwork we do?”\n\n“But holding up a bus,” said Dugan, “to get — Suppose we’re caught?”\n\n“How can we be caught? A lonely road. I know this place. A bus comes\nalong. The driver slows down when he sees us. Thinks we’re passengers.\nWe board the bus. ‘Stick ’em up!’ we say. ‘All we want are cigarettes.’\nAin’t it a break for the passengers?”\n\nBy now, Dugan was holding his sides to keep from laughing. Of course, he\ncould see what Butch meant. But he still didn’t like it. Something told\nhim that no good would come of it, and here they had started on their\nway to Fairview to crack a safe. An inside job with another man to help\nthem.\n\n“Can’t you do without a smoke?” Dugan said. “Until we get there? Maybe\nthis guy will have some—”\n\n“All right. Say, that Rogan has a pack. A half pack. How long will that\nlast? With six men dipping their fingers. And on the way back, what do\nwe do? Go in and look at those signs? And have those guys tell us—”\n\nBy now, the other men were working up a little enthusiasm. After all,\nthey liked a smoke, too. It was something novel so far as they knew, and\nshould be easy to accomplish. They passed through the town and soon were\non the open road. Dugan began to feel better about the idea.\n\n“Sure,” Butch said, “what could we get for holding up a bus and robbing\nthe passengers of cigarettes? Have you thought of that, Dugan?”\n\n“We’d get plenty with our records.”\n\n“Not if guys who sat on the jury tried to get cigarettes and couldn’t,”\nsaid Butch. He let out a guffaw, and even Dugan laughed with the others.\n\nThe car sped along, rolling smoothly over the road. Butch looked at the\nsky and nodded. “I was just thinkin’,” he said. “We’d better bandage our\neyes with our handkerchiefs. We’ll park the car on the side f the road,\nof course. Then after we clean up, we’ll get it. It’ll take us another\nhour to get to Fairview, but we don’t want any hick cops stopping the\ncar and looking for guys fitting our descriptions.”\n\n“Some of the passengers might drop dead,” said Dugan.\n\n“From fright?” said Butch.\n\n“No, when we only take cigarettes.”\n\n“Say, as long as it’s a holdup,” said one of the men, “why not make a\nclean sweep of it?”\n\n“No, only cigarettes,” said Butch. “A quick getaway and leave the\npassengers laughing. You know. I like this idea more and more,” he went\non, as he leaned back and steadied his hand on the wheel. “It’ll be\nsomething to tell the other boys about. I’ll go down in history. A gang\nleader who staged a cigarette holdup and wouldn’t even take a dime from\na passenger.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe High-Jacking\n\nDistant lights of a bus showed, put an end to talk. Butch, alert,\nrealizing that the moment had come, slowed down the car and gave the\norder, “All out. Get over on that corner. There’s a bus stop there.\nHe’ll see you. Quick, now!”\n\nOut they sprang. Butch drove the car to the side of the road. He jumped\nout and rejoined the men, just as the bus came rumbling along within a\nshort distance. The driver saw them and stopped.\n\nThe men had put on their handkerchiefs. The driver stared at them. He\nsaw guns flashing, and was about to start the bus, but Dugan and one of\nthe other men were already on with Butch and the others following.\n\n“Holdup?” gasped the driver.\n\n“Yeah, how are you fixed for cigarettes?” Butch asked.\n\n“Oh, I—I got cigarettes,” said the driver, his teeth chattering. “But—”\n\n“Hand them over.”\n\n“You want only my cigarettes?”\n\n“That’s all. Nickels and dimes don’t interest me.”\n\nThe passengers, some gasping, others frantic—two women began tittering\nhysterically—were told by Dugan and two of the other men, not to worry,\nthat they could keep their shirts, their jewelry, and even their money,\nbut they had to come across with their cigarettes.\n\n“Do you mean that’s all you want?” said a man, his pupils dilating.\n\n“That’s what I mean,” said Butch, striding through the bus. “Now\neverybody be calm. This must be unusual to you, but all we want are your\ncigarettes.” Some of the passengers started laughing, for despite the\nseriousness of the situation, they saw an amusing side. All of them were\nrelieved to know that all that Butch and his men wanted, were\ncigarettes. They kept staring at Butch, as if they couldn’t make him\nout.\n\n“The guy is screwy,” whispered the driver to a passenger near him.\n“Nuts.”\n\n“I don’t know,” said the passenger. “Not that I approve of what he’s\ndoing. But when you get desperate for a smoke—”\n\nCigarettes, a couple unopened packs, a few half-filled packs were\ndropping into hats. Dugan and the other men were going through the bus.\nButch kept his eye on the driver, twirling his gun in his fingers.\n\nFor a moment, he wanted to laugh himself. It was an extraordinary\nadventure. It was what only he, Butch, would think of and execute. A\ncigarette holdup and getting results.\n\nA little man in the rear of the bus looked up furtively. He was the last\nperson to be reached. Dugan stood looking at him and worked his fingers.\n\n“Come across, Pop,” he said. “Got any cigarettes?”\n\n“No cigarettes,” said the man.\n\n“Yeah, well, suppose I find out.”\n\n“All right,” said the man. He put his hand into his pocket, and\nreluctantly handed over a cheap tin cigarette case.\n\nDugan opened it and saw that it was filled. He slipped the case into his\npocket.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Puff\n\nThe holdup had been completed. Butch and his men left as quickly as they\nhad come. Laughing, with laughter following them, for the incident had\ncreated an air of hilarity, they jumped off the bus, hurried to the car\nand sprang into it. “Well, wasn’t it easy?” said Butch.\n\n“Too easy,” said Dugan. “I still say—”\n\n“All right. You say the robbery will be reported. It’ll take that driver\nsome time to get to a phone. It’ll take the road birds time to pick up\nthe call. And we’re breezing along. Like this.” Butch gave the car the\ngas and it lunged forward. “So we’re stopped. What do we say? We don’t\nknow nothin’.”\n\n“But all these cigarettes!” said Dugan. “All right. Can’t we have\ncigarettes? How many packs have we got, anyway?”\n\n“About fifteen,” said Dugan.\n\n“Most of them not full packs. Now, you guys be smart and start filling\nup the spaces. Throw away the empty wrappers. Then see how many full\npacks you have. About seven.”\n\nThe men began filling up the partly filled packs with cigarettes from\nother wrappers. Dugan, still dubious, took out the tin cigarette case.\n“That old guy,” he said, “thought he was foxy. I wonder what kind of\nbutts these are. They look imported. Well, it doesn’t matter. Have a\ncoffin nail?” He turned to Butch.\n\n“0.K.,’ Butch said, “this one I got don’t taste so good. I never did\nlike those Zebras. What brand you got there?” Dugan tried to read the\nbrand but the car lurched. Some of the cigarettes spilled on the floor.\n\n“Here, only a few spilled,” said Dugan. “Let them lie. Have one,\nFrenchy?” He turned.\n\n“How do you like it?” Dugan asked, as Frenchy began puffing.\n\n“Swell! Let Butch try one.”\n\n“So it’s good,” said Butch. “O. K., shove it into my mouth.” Dugan did\nand gave Butch a light. He gave the other men some of “Pop’s”\ncigarettes.\n\n“When I think of that old guy—” said Dugan.\n\nButch had taken a few puffs, smiled, and the car began to swerve.\n\n“Hey, steady it.” said Frenchy.\n\n“The trouble with you guys,” said Butch, talking out of the side of his\nmouth, “is that you don’t wear diamond shirts. I’m fed up with bums that\nonly go in for high hats.”\n\n“Who ain’t got a diamond shirt?” said Frenchy. “Hey. listen, Dugan—”\n\n“You listen to me,” said Dugan. “You think this guy is Butch. He’s the\nDistrict Attorney.”\n\n“Hey, what the hell is this?” said one of the other men. “Is this car on\nfire?”\n\n“Who said anything about a fire?” said Butch. “I’m cold. We’re passing\nover a mountain.”\n\nButch suddenly stopped the car and sprang out. He began reeling. He did\na little shadow boxing, and fell right on his face.\n\nAt the count of nine, which he counted himself, he got up. He swung at\nFrenchy. Dugan didn’t like a pal being treated this way, and he swung at\nButch. He missed him, spun around like a top and met Frenchy, who was\ngoing around the other side of Butch. The other men were reeling\ndeliriously.\n\nThen a police car drew up. A half dozen detectives in it looked at the\nbrawling holdup men in amazement.\n\n“What is it?” said one. “Are those guys drunk? Or are they—”\n\nButch turned. He walked over to the detective and shoved out his hand.\n“My pal!” he said.\n\n“Your pal?” said one of the detectives. “What is—”\n\n“Have a cigarette?” said Dugan, walking over. “Boy, oh, boy! One puff\nand—”\n\n“Marijuana!” shouted one of the detectives. “These must be the guys who—\nthe driver said that a little old guy had got off the bus saying that\nhe’d fix them. These guys are smoking marijuana cigarettes!”\n\n“Would you like to waltz?” said Butch, reeling over. “Who put that piece\nof tripe in the piano?”\n\n“You’ll waltz,” said the detective. “All of you. I was just thinking,\nmen, that there certainly was a joker in the pack!”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

In one a tiny, leaden pellet leaps and bumps with each heave and groan of the sun-kissed ice in spring. The whitened ribs of two are seamed and scarred as by a knife.\n\nUpon the sixth there is no mark. Nor comes there any answering rattle when some loathsome reptile, scurrying from its lair amongst the rocks and crevices, jars against the whitened shell that once encased as foul a brain as e’er polluted God’s green footstool. It lies far apart from the others, denied, even in death, the solace of their companionship.\n\nIt is of the tenant of that sixth grim remnant, gazing, hollow-eyed, toward the heavens it can never enter, that this story is written. The flesh that once covered his weather-bleached bones has long since been carried away by carrion birds; his malignant soul is now frying in hell—unless, by chance, the devil, fearing the corruption of his powers of darkness, has denied the spirit admittance.\n\nHe mocked God and spit upon His Commandments. And the long arm of God reached out and found him—even in the chill, cold arctic hell where he had hidden himself away.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Ever-Mysterious North\n\nLee was the first to die.\n\nThey found him, a month after they had discovered that they were rich—cold and stiff, his face twisted into an indescribable grimace, as if he had died in awful agony. Yet there had been no outcry. Nor was there any mark upon his body to show how he had been struck down.\n\nThe six of them—Lee, the profane; Halligan, the religious; Mason, the student; Wentworth, ill-tempered and moody; Kelly, the hot-blooded Celt; and good-natured, plodding, old Drew—were from the same Mid-Western town. They had grown up together, attended the same school, soldiered in the same squad.\n\nThe same girl had driven them to the land of long winters to seek their fortune.\n\nAnd, smarting under the same misfortune, they had been drawn together, forgetting, for the time, their differences, sharing one another’s dangers, living out of a common purse, laughing at hardships—yet each praying that he might be the one upon whom Fortune’s smile would fall—buoyed up by the memory of a beautiful girl far, far from their adopted home.\n\nAfter a fashion, they were happy. They were filled with primitive vigor and pulsing with life. They lived constant romances and did not know it. For such is the way of the far countries.\n\nAnd the lure of the North had gripped their heartstrings.\n\nThey had been prospecting, without results, all summer, when they chanced upon the unmapped, blind canyon which was destined to he their burial place. Following the noisy little creek up the gulch to the spot where it bubbled from * the side of the rocky wall which blocked the farther end of the canyon, between two gray, grim mountains, they decided to “hole in” for the winter.\n\nThere were signs of gold everywhere. A cabin, old and weatherbeaten—one of the unsolved mysteries of the ever-mysterious North—stood ready for their occupancy with a small amount of repairing. Near by were a dozen mounds —grim reminders of a tragic past. In the cabin were bags filled with nuggets, their coverings rotted away. The whole place breathed of mystery—of mystery and treasure untold. Wood was plentiful and game was abundant.\n\nHalligan and Lee were sent back for supplies. The others divided their time between prospecting the gulch and putting in shape their shack —a four-roomed affair—for they intended spending the winter in comfort.\n\nTwo weeks after the return of the two,-the partners awoke to the realization that they were rich. Before they could even estimate the extent of their find winter arrived, with its long, cold nights, burying the old cabin almost to the eaves under a mass of snow which filled the gulch, tying them up effectually for the remainder of the season.\n\nThere is no stronger test of friendship than the placing of strong, vigorous men for several long, weary months in enforced confinement. With little to do save eat and sleep, forced to gaze at each other day after day, they are apt to fall into a physical lethargy which eventually creates a nervous tension like nothing else in the world. Petty quarrels become serious “matters. Molehills are magnified into mountains. They grow to hate the sight of each other— to become suspicious of what, under other circumstances, would not be noticed. And, when each looks upon his companions as his rivals for the hand of a beautiful woman, hell is bound to break loose sooner or later. It is as inevitable as fate.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Visitation Of God\n\nWhen they found the grisly horror that was Lee, lying stark and stiff in his bunk, gazing, glassy-eyed, toward the ceiling, there was no thought of foul play. It was Halligan who, in straightening out the cold, clinched fingers, discovered the tiny thread of gray wool in the doubled-up fist and called the attention of the others to it.\n\nWentworth was the owner of the only gray shirt in the camp. The others wore khaki or blue. It had been a cold night and he had slept in it. Instantly all eyes were turned upon him, although no word was spoken.\n\nHe turned upon his silent accusers, his lips drawn back in a wolfish snarl.\n\n“Damn it! If you think I done it, say so!” he growled. “If I killed him, how did I do it—and when? You, Halligan, slept in the same room with us.”\n\nHalligan shook his head sadly:\n\n“When I went to bed, the two of you, and Kelly, were soldering that hole in the old coffee-pot. I went to sleep before either of you turned in.”\n\nKelly looked at Halligan angrily, then cast a sympathetic glance at Wentworth.\n\n“I’m sorry to say, boys, that I ‘hit the hay’ before the other two. I wish now that I hadn’t, because I’m confident that if Lee was killed—and I don’t think that he was—it wasn’t Wentworth that done it. He’s not that stripe. In fact.” he hastened on, “none of the bunch is.”\n\nWentworth snorted.\n\n“Keep your blasted sympathy to yourself! I don’t want it!” he growled.\n\nHalligan shook his head mournfully. &amp;lt;\n\n“It’s the visitation of God upon Lee for his blasphemy,” he muttered. “I warned him against it many a time— poor boy.”\n\nThey sat around all day discussing their-companion’s sudden taking away— all but Wentworth. He sat alone in a corner, silently nursing his grievances. They had searched the body; there was not a mark upon it. The other four were loud in their statements that Lee must have died a natural death. But there was a feeling of coldness—an indescribable something that cast a pall over them all—a feeling toward their once-trusted comrade—a feeling that the long, lonely days of idleness and soundless nights of the past now magnified into an unspoken suspicion.\n\nLate in the afternoon they carried Lee’s body up the gulch a few yards and buried it in a shallow grave dug in the ice .and snow, where it would have to lie until spring opened up again. The ground was frozen too hard to dig a grave being covered by a dozen feet of hard-packed snow and ice.\n\nOnly Wentworth remained away from the simple funeral, sitting glumly by himself inside the cabin while Halligan mumbled, brokenly, as much as he could remember of the burial service.\n\nIt was late when they retired that night. All but Wentworth. He refused to eat any supper, throwing himself onto his bunk immediately after the others had finished eating, where he lay, scowling, his eyes staring into vacancy.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Pall Of Acrid Smoke\n\nThey slept fitfully. It was nearly morning when they were awakened by the sharp explosion of a gun.\n\nThey leaped to their feet and one of them struck a match and lighted a, flickering tallow candle.\n\nWentworth lay dead in his blankets. Over him hung a pall of acrid smoke.\n\nHe lay upon his back, a bullet hole in his temple, his lips drawn back in the same wolfish snarl he had worn during the day. On the floor beside him, where it had dropped from his nerveless hand, lay his revolver.\n\nNext morning they buried him in the snow beside the man who they were now sure had been his victim. And once more it was Halligan who was called upon to say a prayer.\n\nAgain he repeated his warning.\n\n“Can’t you see, boys,” he mourned, “that the Lord visited his wrath upon Wentworth for his sins—just as he did upon Lee. A man’s evil deeds will find him out. It’s a warning for you all to repent before it’s too late.”\n\nThere was no work done that day. Even the dishes were allowed to go greasy and unwashed while they discussed again and again the various phases of the second tragedy that had befallen their little community.\n\nWentworth had never been popular with the others, his moroseness and general tone of surly indifference to everything keeping him from being the general favorite that the profane but good-natured Lee had been. Yet it was hard to believe that he had stooped to murder.\n\nAs usual, it was Halligan, the born leader, who aroused them from their apathy. Putting the others to cleaning up the dishes, he cooked a hasty supper and compelled the three to eat with him.\n\n“There’s no use getting the doldrums,” he admonished them. “They’re dead, and sitting around mooning won’t bring ‘em back. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Of course, it’s up to us to see that their heirs get their share of the mine after we’ve taken our wages out for working it. When we’ve fed and cleaned up the shack we’ll have a game of cards and turn in early. I, for one, am sleepy.”\n\nSo were they all, for, within an hour after they had eaten, the four of them were yawning vigorously. They crawled into their bunks, Halligan, who refused to sleep in the room where Lee and Wentworth had met their deaths, climbing into a spare bunk with the others.\n\n\n\nMason was the first to awaken next morning. He shouted for the others as he leaped out of his blankets and crawled into his clothes. Replenishing the logs in the fireplace in the living-room, he again yelled at the other three and turned his attention to breakfast.\n\nA second later a loud cry from Kelly brought Halligan to his feet, while Mason ran in from the outer room.\n\nFor Drew lay dead in his bunk. Between his ribs, buried to the hilt, was a hunting-knife. And it was Mason’s knife.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Girl And The Money\n\nKelly carefully drew the knife from the wound and looked at the initials carved on the handle.\n\n“So, ‘twas you, after all, was it, you skunk?” he snarled at Mason. “You with your damned sneaking ways and your smooth, oily manner, eh? Though why you were fool enough to leave your knife stickin’ in him is what I can’t understand. Scared away, were you?”\n\nMason stepped back a pace, a look of amazement on his proud face.\n\n“I swear by the ever-living God, boys, that I am innocent!” he declared. “Why would I kill Drew?”\n\n“Why—yes, why?” snorted Kelly, his eyes glittering. “For the same reason that you killed Lee and threw the blame for it onto poor Wentworth, damn your soul! I suppose that Halligan and I were to be the next, eh ?” he went on. i tli us out of the way you’d be a rich man. And then you could go back and marry Cora Hunter. Oh, I’m no fool.”\n\nHalligan, sitting on the edge of his bunk putting on his moccasins, said nothing. Kelly, his Celtic temper leaping to the surface, was intensely angry.\n\nMason, too, was a man of hot passions, although he held them under better restraint than did the Irishman. He took a half-step toward his accuser.\n\n“Kelly—and Halligan,” he began in a level voice, “I didn’t kill Drew, nor had I a hand in the death of Lee. It’s just as much of a mystery to me how my knife got there as it is to you.”\n\n“’Tis no mystery to me,” snapped Kelly. “You put it there, you cur.”\n\n“You’re a damned liar!”\n\nKelly leaped upon him, the knife he still held in his hand upraised. Mason’s fist met him half-way, striking him squarely in the face, but failing to stop his rush.\n\nWith a lurid oath the burly Irishman jabbed the weapon into the other’s side half a dozen times.\n\nWith his bare fists Mason fought the other as best he could for a second or two. His fingers clutched weakly about his antagonist’s windpipe. He struggled blindly for a second, fumbling feebly for a hold. Then his knees doubled under him and, with a dull moan, he sank to the floor at Kelly’s feet.\n\nWithout a sign of undue haste, Halligan buckled his belt and holster about his waist. Coolly he unbuttoned the holster and drew the gun. He cocked the weapon and, with his finger on the trigger, waited for the others to settle their argument.\n\n“Did you get him?” he asked, as Kelly stepped back and wiped the blood from his streaming nose.\n\n“Yes, an’ I’m damned glad of it— the swine!”\n\nBefore he could turn around, Halligan placed the muzzle of his gun against the back of the Irishman’s head and pulled the trigger. A dazed expression crept over Kelly’s face. The knife dropped from his hand. Then he fell in a heap across the body of his late antagonist.\n\nHalligan replaced the weapon in its holster and felt of the Irishman’s heart. Assuring himself that it had ceased to beat, he raised his eyes to Mason, who was staring at him dazedly.\n\n“You saved my life, Halligan,” the wounded man muttered thickly; “but you took so long doing it that he got me anyway. Much obliged—just—same.”\n\nHalligan grinned.\n\n“If I did, I’m sorry,” he remarked, cheerfully. “ ‘Cause then I’ll have to finish you myself. It wouldn’t do for you to live, you see, because you know too much. And, besides, I want everything for myself—the girl and the money both.”\n\nThe dying man looked at him curiously. “You don’t mean that it was you, Halligan? Great God! And I never suspected!”\n\nHalligan sat down on the edge of his bunk and laughed good-humoredly as he unbuckled his gun and threw it across the foot of the bed.\n\n“I don’t mind telling you about it,” he said quietly, “because you’ll soon be where you can never tell.”\n\nHe rolled a cigarette and, lighting it, inhaled a whiff before he continued: “You see, Mason, I figured out long ago that as soon as we struck it rich— and I felt sure that we would sooner or later—it would be a survival of the fittest. I knew that there was no chance for any of us with Cora until we had money. She’s a selfish little devil, but she’s worth fighting for. And, with all of us rich, we would be just where we started. But now it’ll be me alone— just me.\n\n“When we struck pay here, you remember it was me that suggested putting in here for the winter. I knew that it would be easy for me to plant the seed of suspicion in all of you, for, deep down in your hearts, you all felt as I did and each one of you suspected the other. And you were as jealous as a bunch of chorus girls.\n\n“Wentworth killed Lee all right. I watched him do it from the other room, where I was supposed to be asleep. I suggested the idea of it to him without him knowing it several days before. He and I were doing a job of soldering and I told him a story I got from my grandmother—about a man who had murdered his wife by pouring a drop of hot lead in her ear.\n\n“After Kelly turned in that night, Lee and Wentworth sat up soldering, you remember. Finally Lee dropped off to sleep with his head on the table. It was too good an opportunity for Wentworth to miss—for he hated Lee’s guts—so he drops a bit of the hot solder into Lee’s ear. He died without a struggle, as I knew he would—for the infernal stuff paralyzes every faculty. Afterward Wentworth took off his boots and sneaked in to see if we were asleep. Finding that we were, he carried Lee in and laid him on his bunk.\n\n“You remember how Wentworth tore his shirt on a nail there by the door? I recollected that there was a scrap of wool banging onto it. When Wentworth went back into the other room to put away his tools, I jumped out, took the little piece of wool from the nail and got it into Lee’s clenched fingers and jumped back into bed before Wentworth returned. Pretty smooth, eh?\n\n“Wentworth couldn’t stand the gaff. He imagined that I knew that he had killed Lee, so he killed himself.”\n\nMason groaned.\n\n“I killed Wentworth!” he blurted out. “You told me that he had—that he—he—about what he done to—to Cora. I saw that this was a good opportunity to get rid of him and let you fellows think he had done it himself.” You put me up to it, you devil!”\n\nHalligan laughed.\n\n“So it was you, after all, eh?” he chuckled. “I knew that you had swallowed my little story, but I’ll confess that I didn’t think you would get busy so quick.”\n\n“But the letter you showed me from her—from Cora?”\n\nHalligan chuckled again. “Mason, I don’t mind telling you that when I went after supplies with Lee I fixed up five letters, all identical except the names. I put one of your names in each letter. I showed each one of you a different letter, playing each one of you against the other. That’s why Kelly knifed you. He didn’t care a cuss for Drew—he was itching for an opportunity to get you. See? I stuck Drew myself, using your knife to throw suspicion on you, knowing that it would start the Irishman. Where I miscalculated was in thinking that you’d be armed. I didn’t want to stain my own hands with murder any more than I had to. I put some dope in all of your grub last night when I got supper so that I could pull off the stunt without arousing you.\n\n“That idea of mine of playing each one of you against the other was pretty slick, wasn’t it? No one knows of the existence of this blind gulch here. I’ll have a pretty good nest egg, and, after I marry Cora, I can always take a run back here for more if I need it. Of course, I’ll bury all of you fellows nice and shipshape and I’ll tell them back home about our separating and each going in a different direction. Oh, I’ve got a good yarn cooked up, all right.”\n\nThe wounded man glared at him malignantly.\n\n“Damn you!” he cried. “God’s long arm will get you yet—even out here in the ice and snow of this God-forsaken country.”\n\nHalligan smiled. “God? Bah! If I’d believed in such foolishness I’d never won out over the rest of you. But I made you think I did—and that’s how I got the best of you.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nBeginning Of The End\n\nHe arose and stretched himself. Then, seizing the dead man, he dragged his victim out of doors and buried him alongside of the others.\n\nMason watched him at his work with glaring eyes. Then, as he left the room, the wounded man dragged himself across the few feet that separated him from the bunk.\n\nCarefully, every movement filled with pain, he reached up and took the gun. He tried to lift himself to his feet and felt himself going.\n\n“O God,” he murmured, “help me— help me—get him—don’t let him get— away with it. Help me for Cora’s sake.”\n\nHe succeeded in getting the weapon cocked—in hiding it inside his trousers pocket.\n\nHis jaw dropped and, with a convulsive twitch, he died.\n\nHalligan finished burying Kelly and returned to the cabin for warmth. Replenishing the fire, he entered the other room and found Mason dead. Throwing him across his shoulder, he staggered out into the gulch again and laid him on the snow crust while he hastily scooped another shallow grave.\n\nHe bent over the body to roll it into the hole. As he did so there was a flash and a report. The bullet swept across his lids, searing them with its heat. His eyes were filled with the powder.\n\nBlinded, sobbing with his misery, he tried to grope his way back to the cabin. He lost his sense of direction. He stumbled and fell, arose and stumbled again. His snowshoes dropped from his feet. Too miserable to care, he tried to go on without them. He broke through the crust to his waist. On and on he floundered his way, whimpering with pain—chilled to the marrow—thinking to reach the cabin, but ever getting farther from it.\n\nAnd finally, exhausted, blinded, freezing, he fell into the stupor, which marks the beginning of the end in the Land of Eternal Snow.\n\nFor the sudden cold, grasping hold of the dead body of Mason, had hastened rigor mortis. The dead fingers, stiffening suddenly, had tightened about the trigger of the hidden revolver.\n\nIt was the long arm of God.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Breakin’ Out\n  Settin’ In\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nBreakin’ Out\n\nNick Ryan tossed aside the magazine he’d been reading by the dingy light of a bulb overhead. But he didn’t get up from the cot, as Sheriff Capehart came along the shadowy corridor that led back to the cellblock. Nick was a slim, dark young man with sly features. He was openly contemptuous of everybody in his hometown of Piney Point.\n\nSheriff Capehart, a heavy, middle-aged man with phlegmatic grey eyes, came up close to the bars and stood looking at Nick.\n\nGrinning slyly, Nick asked, “You come to turn me loose, sheriff?”\n\n“No, I didn’t,” grunted the sheriff. “I came to ask if you want to confess killin’ my brother Sam before I go to bed.”\n\n“Surely you don’t think I’d kill anybody!”\n\n“I sure do! You hid in Sam’s hardware and jewelry store until after he’d closed and was working on his books. You made him open his safe, cleaned out from it all the watches and rings and money and suchlike, then you killed him. You killed him, because he knew who you were.”\n\nNick looked grieved. “Sheriff, you make me feel bad. Here I am, a hometown boy who went off to the big city and made good. Then, when I come back to visit my poor old father, you throw me in the clink and accuse me of murder. Why, you knew me when I was a kid—”\n\n“That’s just it—a thievin’, window breaking alley rat! And I’ve heard a lot of worse things about you since you went off to Pittsfield. Mixed up with Sledge Mangrum’s bunch up there, ain’t you? And you didn’t come home on a visit— you come to rob somebody!”\n\n“What makes you think I killed Sam Capehart?”\n\n“Because you’d been hangin’ about his store for the last couple of days. You were seen to go into the store just a little while before he closed the day he was killed.”\n\n“I went out again by the back door. I could prove that by your brother Sam, if he wasn’t dead.” There was open mockery in Nick’s laugh. “Anyway, I’ve got an air-tight alibi. The night Sam Capehart was killed and robbed, I was at home all night. That’s a pretty hot alibi, ain’t it? My own father’s word?”\n\nThe sheriff growled, “Tebe Ryan’s a lazy, booze-swillin’ thief and always was! He’d sooner lie than tell the truth.” /But it’d carry weight in court. Maybe I killed Sam Capehart. Sheriff, but you’ve got no proof and you know it. That lawyer I brought down from Pittsfield is pretty slick. He says that if you don’t produce some evidence, you can’t hold me any longer than tomorrow.”\n\nThe sheriff sighed. “Looks like he’s right. I know you killed poor Sam, but I can’t prove it. Reckon I’ll—”\n\n“You’ll stay still, if you want to live!” a cold voice said.\n\nSheriff Capehart turned and looked surprisedly at the two men who had stepped from the shadowy corridor behind him. One was chunky and dark, the other tall, with pale eyes and a hooked nose. They had wicked-looking automatics in their hands.\n\nThe sheriff said belligerently, “What’s this? What’re you two doin’ here? Don’t you know I’m the sheriff?”\n\n“Sure, we know it,” snapped the tall man. He shoved the sheriff back into the corridor. “Get up front, Fatty!”\n\nNick Ryan got up from the cot. He could see the two shoving Sheriff Capehart along the corridor. He heard the sheriff protest shrilly, “Hold on here! I’m the law—you can’t—” He saw the automatic in the tall man’s hand rise and fall, saw the sheriff wilt down to the floor and lie there still.\n\nThe two came back to the cellblock. The tall man said, “Get the keys, Blackie.”\n\nThe dark man took a ring holding several keys from a nail on the wall. He opened Nick’s cell door.\n\n“All right, Nick,” the pale-eyed man said coldly. “Get your hat.”\n\nNick was puzzled. He didn’t know these two. He backed to the cot and sat down.\n\n“I’ll sit this one out,” he said. “That dumb sheriff’s got nothin’ on me. I’ve got a hot alibi. I’d be a sap to break out of here, when I’ll be out legally in twenty-four hours anyway. I’m not goin’ anywhere.”\n\n“That’s what you think, smart aleck!” The tall man slapped Nick, hard, caught him by the shoulder and flung him toward the cell door. “Step out, fast!”\n\nNick didn’t argue any more. He didn’t know yet what cooked, but he knew that these two weren’t here as friends, as he had at first thought. The men with the guns were close behind him as he went along the corridor, stepped over the sheriff’s still form, went through the sheriff’s office at the front of the one-story brick building and onto the street. The street was deserted, for it was after midnight and only dimly lighted.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nSettin’ In\n\nA dark sedan was drawn up at the curb half a block away. Blackie slid under the wheel, the tall man got in the back seat with Nick. The automatic was still in his hand. Blackie started the engine.\n\n“Which way, Jake?” he asked.\n\n“Straight for Pittsfield,” Jake said. “We’re safe.”\n\nThe sedan moved out of town and at a moderate speed northward along the highway. Nobody spoke for a couple of miles.\n\nThen Nick said angrily, “Would you mind telling me what the hell this is all about?”\n\n“Sledge wants to see you,” Jake said briefly. “He heard you were in that hick jail. He sent us to get you.”\n\n“Sledge Mangrum? What’s he want to see me about?”\n\n“You know what about. It was a crazy thing, Nick, killing Sledge’s kid brother Joe.”\n\n“Somebody’s crazy, all right! But if somebody killed Joe Mangrum, it wasn’t me.\n\n“Sledge thinks different. He knows you and Joe had some trouble over a chick, knows you threatened to kill the kid. So when Joe was found in a back room of Marty’s place with a blade in his gullet—with Marty swearing you and Joe had come in together—Sledge started looking for you. It gave me the creeps, hearing some of the things Sledge swore he’d do to yon.”\n\nNick was quiet a moment, feeling cold and leaden in his stomach. He wasn’t really on the inside of Sledge Mangrum’s gang, only on the fringe, because Sledge had turned thumbs down on him. He knew little about Big Sledge, but he’d heard things that made his insides curl up, about what Sledge did to those he didn’t like. He knew Sledge’s kid brother Joe, a wicked, strutting little rat. They’d fought over a girl one night.\n\nHe’d heard that Sledge Mangrum loved only one thing on earth—that vicious, swaggering kid brother of his.\n\n“Look,” Nick said. “When did Joe get it?”\n\n“Last Monday night, about midnight.”\n\n“Then I can prove I didn’t do it. I was here, in Piney Point, last Monday midnight!”\n\n“Maybe. In a jail cell?”\n\n“No, that wasn’t till Tuesday. I was—” Nick stopped. At midnight Monday he had been in Sam Capehart’s store. It was just about then that he’d killed a man.\n\nThe tires whined on the pavement. The pines on each side of the highway were dark and still.\n\nBlackie said over his shoulder, “Remember what Sledge done to Mack Parker the time Mack double-crossed him? Mack’s mind never was right after that. They had to put him away.”\n\nNick blurted, “Damn it, didn’t I say I didn’t kill Joe?”\n\n“Tell that to Sledge,” Jake murmured. “But it’ll take more than just your word, or your old man’s, to make him believe it.”\n\n“What if I could prove I was two hundred miles from Pittsfield at midnight Monday?”\n\n“That’d be fine for you, but I don’t think you can.”\n\n“Sure, I can,” Nick said eagerly. “You know why I was in the can?”\n\n“We know all about it. So what?”\n\n“You know what time Sam Capehart was killed and robbed?”\n\n“About midnight, they claim, on Monday—”\n\n“It was me that pulled that job! I couldn’t have done that, and killed Joe Mangrum in Pittsfield at the same time, could I?”\n\nBlackie laughed. “No soap, Wick. We know that dumb sheriff just picked you up on suspicion. You didn’t croak old Capehart.”\n\n“I did, I tell you! If I showed you the loot—the watches and rings and stuff—that would prove it, wouldn’t it?”\n\nJake said slowly, “Nick, you’re a sneaky, blood-thirsty little rat. But you show me that and I’ll tell Sledge you didn’t kill Joe.”\n\nNick took a deep breath of relief. “A couple of miles ahead a gravel road turns off to the left into the woods. Follow it, and I’ll show you where the stuff is.”\n\nFive minutes later the sedan was bumping along a crooked, forest-hemmed side road. At a word from Nick, Blackie stopped the car at a narrow concrete bridge. Nick got out, followed by Jake with the gun, and went down into the dry creek bed.\n\nThe black satchel was cunningly hidden.\n\nBack on the road, in the glare from the car lights, Jake opened the satchel. It was crammed with glittering jewelry and money. Some of the price tags carried the name of Sam Capehart.\n\n“That satisfy you?” Nick asked.\n\n“It sure does,” Jake said. But he didn’t put away his gun.\n\nThe headlights of a car approached swiftly along the old gravel road. The car stopped and a heavy figure got out.\n\n“All right, boys?” Sheriff Capehart asked.\n\n“Okay, sheriff,” Jake said. “He’s your meat, well-done!”\n\nThat coldness was in Nick Ryan’s stomach again. He knew suddenly that he’d been a sucker. He said furiously, “You double-crossin’ snakes! Joe Mangrum’s not dead! You two don’t belong to Sledge Mangrum’s gang!”\n\n“Did they tell you that?” The sheriff snapped a pair of handcuffs on Nick’s wrists. “Why, they’re just a couple of boys from over at Rockport that I got to help me. They wouldn’t hurt a grasshopper. It was a real hot alibi you had to prove you never killed my brother Sam, Nick. But not hot as the chair you’ll soon be settin’ in!”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

His family was poor but respectable. Old man Cragen was a law-abiding citizen and Mother Cragen a benevolent, white-haired woman whose fondest recollections were of the County Mayo.\n\nEnvironment played a large role in the drama of Joe Cragen. His family lived on Tenth Avenue and before he was in long trousers, he was running with a gang of pickpockets. Before he was nineteen, Cragen was Shorty McCabe’s first lieutenant. When a cop cut short the career of the McCabe with a half inch of lead, leadership of the dreaded Power House gang was Cragen’s by right of inheritance. It was then that he became a Guerilla.\n\nUnder his aggressive guidance the Power House band flourished and grew opulent. The strip of territory they commanded adjoined the waterfront of the Hudson River and existed in a state of terror. Timid citizens shunned it with a shudder; the policeman that patroled it walked in the center of the streets, directing cautious glances at the housetops. When gang fights were in progress, the quarter huddled in cellars, but battles were few. The Power House gang was seldom attacked.\n\nSo long as Joe Cragen kept to his own district all went well. For a year, he sat on the throne of the Power House band and ruled with a mailed fist.\n\nBut there fell an evil day when in a bandit taxi he ventured into lower Manhattan. He had made plans to stick-up the paying teller of an east side bank.\n\nThe plot worked easily, but the nerve of the bank employee had not been considered. In the pistol duel that resulted, Cragen feinted the teller out into the open, braved the man’s fusillade, shot him four times from the doorway, leaped back into the pirate taxi and vanished.\n\nThe same night Cragen crept through the meshes of far-flung police nets and “rode the cushions” to Chicago, leaving the Power House gang to be broken up by the police.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nNothing To It\n\nOn an August night four years after the bank stick-up, and the flight of Cragen, a lean, gray-haired individual in a rusty blue serge suit, cracked shoes and greasy cap entered Wolger’s West Street hotel, crossed the uncarpeted lobby floor and moved to the desk that Abraham Wolger presided over, where he spoke briefly.\n\n“How much for a flop?”\n\nWolger pulled the glasses up on his curved nose, rubbed a hairy ear and after plumbing his inquisitor with a long stare frowned thoughtfully.\n\n“A quarter for the night,” he replied slowly.\n\nThe stranger produced two dimes and a nickel, wrote the name Andrew Hardy in a grimy register and was led off to one of the small, cot-adorned coops the hotel was honeycombed with, Wolger staring after him.\n\nIn the room he had rented for the night, the man who called himself Andrew Hardy closed the door and sat down on the bed. For a time, he stared at the floor with narrowed eyes. Finally he took an envelope from a pocket of his shabby jacket, unfolded it and with painstaking care spilled out a quantity of something that resembled talcum powder.\n\nHe dropped it on the crease in his hand made by thumb and forefinger and sniffed it up his nose in the manner of one taking snuff.\n\nReplacing the envelope in his pocket the man flexed his arms and sighed contentedly. He reached in a hip pocket and lifted out a small blackjack with a thong about the neck of it for the wrist.\n\nHe examined it with obvious satisfaction, wet his finger and rubbed away some dark stains and small pieces of hair from its blunt, leather-covered nose. He dropped it back into his hip pocket and stared at the floor again.\n\nSeveral minutes later he closed the door of the cubicle and went down into the lobby, making his way to Wolger’s desk.\n\n“Where can I get a snifter of kick?” he inquired shortly.\n\nAs he spoke he made a peculiar sign with the thumb and little finger that was significant to the proprietor of the hotel, versed in the mute language of crookdom.\n\n“Downstairs,” Wolger directed, frankly searching the man’s face with a puzzled expression. “First door to the left at the end of the hall.”\n\nThe one he addressed nodded and slouched away. He traversed a short hall, opened a door and descended into a basement where illicit drinks were being served to furtive faced clients by a lantern jawed waiter who wore a filthy apron.\n\nThe man seated himself at an empty table and rummaged through his pockets until he found a few pieces of silver. He laid them down on the table and waited until he attracted the attention of the waiter.\n\n“Rye, Bill. Back me up a wash of it and never mind the water.”\n\nA half pint of fiery moonshine was set before him. The man consumed a third of it, pulled his greasy cap well over his eyes, folded his arms and slouched back in his chair.\n\nFor ten minutes or more, he sat stirless. After a while he became aware of the sound of chair legs being drawn along the cement floor; garments brushed him and presently the words of a whispered conversation drifted back to his ears.\n\n“There’s nothing to it,” the voice of a man said. “Tip Regan looked it over and said it’s as safe as a church. The old woman locks the store up and crawls into the feathers at ten bells.”\n\nA second voice containing a note of warning sounded.\n\n“Soft pedal—there’s a gin hound back of you.”\n\nAndrew Hardy, as he called himself, felt he was being intently scrutinized.\n\n“Stewed to the scalp,” the first speaker said after a pause. “As I was saying. Tip’s got a freight as job in the Pennsy yards and is pulling silk. He passed the word to me. It looks good.”\n\n“What’s the dope?” the other asked in guarded accents. “Where’s the store at? What time do we take a shot at it?”\n\nThere came the clink of glasses and a cough.\n\n“It’s called the Empire Fish Market,” the first speaker resumed. “It’s up on Eleventh Avenue, corner of Forty-ninth Street. The old moll that runs it is a widow woman. She knows a pollie and a couple of big restaurants have been taking all of her fish. Tip says she’s got about two grand salted away in a drawer under the counter in the store. The old girl is foxy and has an electric bell on the drawer. She thinks that will keep it safe.”\n\nGlasses clinked again for a minute or two.\n\n“Sounds mighty good,” the second speaker muttered. “I’m with you. When do we start up?”\n\nThe man who called himself Andrew Hardy strained his ears.\n\n“Not before one o’clock,” the first voice answered. “Here’s the way we go in—”\n\nHis words were drowned out by a gusty rumble of conversation from across the room; almost at once a party of men entered the basement and took chairs noisily at the table to the left of the listener.\n\nThe self-styled Andrew Hardy waited no longer. He climbed to his feet and in imitation of one very drunk lurched to the door.\n\nHe threw it open with a maudlin backward glance that mentally photographed the faces of the two conspirators, closed it and hurried up and cut into West Street where a young moon sailed low, in a day-long heat haze.\n\nA pulse of excitement began to beat within him. The hour was not quite midnight and more than sixty minutes still remained before the two men of the basement would put their plans into effect.\n\nHe fumbled in his pockets until he found a five-cent piece, turned east to the first avenue beyond and arrived in time to leap to the running board of a north bound surface car.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Tenement\n\nAt the corner of Forty-ninth Street the man alighted and turned toward the river.\n\nThe street he passed through was squalid with drab tenements marching cheek to cheek in dingy array. The gutters were filled with refuse awaiting the prowling garbage remover; the iron fire escape landings were heaped with disordered bedding upon which heat-wilted children tossed.\n\nThe street was tawdry and pallid with no single redeeming feature. Yet the man who passed along it darted eager glances to the right and left. His attitude was almost that of one returning to a beloved spot after a long absence.\n\nOn the corner of Eleventh Avenue he slowed his pace, halted altogether, and took stock of his surroundings. The junction of street and avenue was deserted save for a nocturnal stationer closing his shop; no brass buttons glinted in the lamplight—the section was wrapped in the heavy stillness of an August midnight.\n\nWith footsteps that displayed no incertitude, the man approached a fish store directly opposite from where he stood. It was one of three shops in a red brick tenement; a narrow, lightless entrance and hallway separated the fish market from the other two shops. The man walked past the building, brows drawn together, turned and after a quick glance about entered the tenement’s hallway.\n\nSome knowledge of the construction of stores seemed to be at his command. To the left of the building’s narrow, wooden stairway was a single door—a door that opened into the back room or rooms of the fish market.\n\nThe man tested its china knob, found it did not respond to his touch and lighted a match, cupping it in the palm of his hands. He held the light aloft, perceived the glass transom over the door, smiled faintly and plunged his light out.\n\nIn the murk he fumbled for his folded envelope. He dropped some more of its powder on his hand and inhaled it.\n\nHe listened for a minute before mounting a few steps of the stairway.\n\nWhen he was opposite the transom he leaned over the rail of the stairway and pushed it in with the palms of both hands. To his infinite relief it swung in, squeaking rustily.\n\nHe listened again and made his way down the steps.\n\nHe wound a dirty handkerchief about the china knob of the door, removed his shoes, placed his left foot on the knob and caught the ledge of the transom.\n\nWith sinuous agility he drew himself up and over the sill, wriggling through the small space made by the open transom and dropping with scarce a sound to the floor on the inner side of the door.\n\nIt was too dark to ascertain what his surroundings were, so he stood motionless, straining his ears. Suddenly, so close that he recoiled, he heard a sibilant sigh and the creak of bed springs. He drew his brows together again and fingered his lips. It was impossible that he had erred; in all probability this room was a chamber adjoining the fish store—the bedroom of the old woman the two conspirators had spoken of. He decided there must be a door near at hand that opened into the store itself and determined to locate it forthwith.\n\nWith the deep, even breathing of the sleeper in his ears, the man followed his sense of direction and groped a careful way forward. With each step his blood warmed within him.\n\nTwo grand in crook parlance meant two thousand dollars. It was a sum worth striving for. With that amount of money in his possession he could fulfill long cherished ambitions.\n\nIt could buy enough dope to lead him into a Castle of Dreams; put the city he had entered so recently from him and journey to the coast. The key to all wishes was before him—in a hidden drawer under the counter in a fish store.\n\nThe outstretched hand of the man slid over another door. They touched a knob and turned it. The second door did not yield and was keyless.\n\nHe stood still for a minute, thinking. The woman who owned the shop was canny. She evidently understood the difficulty of breaking in from the outside, and by locking the connecting door and secreting the key made doubly difficult the felon’s progress.\n\nThe man turned his head in the direction of the bed. He must possess the key that opened the door or the expedition would be fruitless. He drew the leather-covered billy from his pocket and slipped the thong about his wrist. He debated briefly whether it was advisable to wake the sleeper and demand the key or to use the blackjack immediately and search for it at his leisure. His ruminations were abruptly terminated by a sharp inquiry that cut the gloom like a knife:\n\n“Who is there?”\n\nThe man stiffened, his fingers winding about the neck of the blackjack. The bed creaked again and two soft footfalls sounded one after the other. He strove to pierce the curtain of blackness with his eyes, but failed. In some way the sleeper had become aware of his presence; he heard hurried, rattling breathing that was an indication of fear.\n\nHis fingers about the blackjack grew still tighter.\n\nThe dull patter of feet moving preceded the rasp of a key being turned warily in the door that opened into the hall of the tenement. Even though frightened, the woman was not losing her head. She intended preparing an exit if escape became necessary and a vantage point from which she could both survey the bedchamber and raise a quick alarm if her suspicions proved to be correct.\n\nA dozen rapid steps carried the man across the darkened expanse of room. He brought himself up short as he collided with an unseen figure, clutching a withered throat with his left hand and effectually preventing a scream from surging to lips opened to receive it. At the same moment he thrust the weight of his body forward in such fashion as to put himself next to the door and forced the woman away from it.\n\n“Where’s the key to the other door?” He released the pressure of his hand on the throat sufficiently to permit a weak voice trembling with terror to croak a panted answer:\n\n“Under—the—mattress—”\n\nSavage elation brought the teeth of the man together with a grinding click; he began to force the woman across the room, laughing at the puny, feeble blows she struck wildly at him.\n\nHe dug his fingers deeper into the thin throat, an old lust to kill swimming in his blood. He strove to see how far he might choke her before insensibility came, laughing louder at the faint moans and series of agonized gasps that came just before the mad, futile blows ceased and she staggered in his clutch.\n\nThen wearying of the sport and mindful that time was flying, he used his blackjack twice, flung his victim across the bed and delved under the mattress …\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nMurder In A Fish Store\n\nThe following morning, Abraham Wolger, at the desk in his West Street hotel, looked up from the third morning edition of his favorite paper and addressed a burly youth who was sweeping out the uncarpeted lobby with a worn broom.\n\n“Look it, Jake,” he said, stabbing the newspaper with his stubby finger. “Last night was a murder in a fish store up on Eleventh Avenue. Two thousand dollars was stole and the old woman what owned it got murdered. Ain’t it funny?\n\n“It says right here she was Mrs. Cragen, the mother of that Guerilla what croaked that guy in a bank four years ago this month—the same guy I was telling you looked just like a man who registered here last night and never showed up again.”\n\nThe youth with the broom fingered a twisted ear.\n\n“Was there any pinches made?” he asked succinctly.\n\nThe proprietor of the hotel looked back at his paper.\n\n“Yes—the cops grabbed the two guys as they were coming out—a coupla friends of Tip Regan, they were. They didn’t find the two grand on them, the paper says, but what difference does it make? The chair for both of them sure! Honest, Jake, guys like that who would croak a widow woman ought to get burned in the chair …”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  At Myrtle Lodge\n  The Man with the Whip\n  A Biter Bit!\n  “Untoward Circumstances”\n  Gentle Pete!\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n“When a man dies, my dear Hawke,” said Dr. Wilthorpe, lighting a cigar, “he usually gives up playing the fool, but not so Alderman Wickham.\n\n“He was a mass of contradictions in life,” proceeded the surgeon, “always saying one thing and doing the opposite. And here’s a mystery for you, Hawke. Alderman Wickham was found dead at his desk in his home at Northall. The fingers of his right hand were holding the stem of a glass in which were still some dregs of whisky.\n\n“A simple test showed that these dregs contained a strong solution of strychnine, which should have produced a much more painful death than appearances suggested had been the ease.\n\n“The post-mortem examination showed advanced heart disease, and no trace of strychnine or any other poison.”\n\n“Wait a minute,” said Dixon Hawke. “D’you mind saying that all over again?”\n\n“It’s a fact,” insisted Wilthorpe. “Alderman Wickham was not poisoned by strychnine. So his death pose makes him a liar.”\n\n“What was the cause of death then?”\n\n“A strong emotional shock could have done it. His heart was in a very bad way.”\n\n“But someone must have put the poison in the dregs of whisky,” broke in Tommy Burke, Hawke’s assistant, who was also present.\n\nWilthorpe nodded.\n\n“Presumably after Wickham had drunk from the glass—possibly after his death.”\n\n“But what could the object be, sir? It doesn’t make sense.”\n\n“If it made sense, young man, I wouldn’t have wasted my time in coming round here to tell you about it,”\n\nThe doctor thoughtfully paced the study floor for a moment.\n\n“There’s a man named Charles Jackson under suspicion. One of Wickham’s ex-employees, and a panel patient of mine incidentally. I wish you’d clear him. He’s had enough worry already. Wife and five kids. Wickham told him his wages weren’t enough to keep such a family, and sacked him. That was Wickham’s way. Jackson called at Ins house during the evening to plead for the return of his job, and there was a row.\n\n“It was no crime if Wickham got over-excited in argument, and I thought maybe you could use your influence and persuade your Scotland Yard friends to leave Jackson alone for the moment, for the sake of his family.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nAt Myrtle Lodge\n\nHawke and Tommy were in no need of an excuse for entry to Myrtle Lodge, the home of the late Alderman Wickham. The place was full of people when they arrived.\n\nA short, rotund man with a pointed grey beard informed the visitors that Wickham had called a meeting of the local carnival committee for that day, and most of the members had arrived without knowing of the tragedy.\n\nThey were partaking of cake and tea before being sent away.\n\nHawke crossed into a room with French windows, where he had sighted Inspector Browne, of the C.I.D.\n\n“This is going to be a ticklish job for the coroner,” declared the inspector. ** The fact is that the strychnine in the whisky glass had nothing to do with the death, and therefore, I suppose, need have nothing to do with the inquest. Or need it?”\n\n“The thing to do is to find an explanation of how the strychnine got in the glass,” said Hawke.\n\n“Also an explanation of the monkey nuts which were found on the carpet,” supplemented the inspector.\n\nThe officer pointed to a heap of broken shells on the mantelpiece.\n\n“The butler informs me that Wickham did not make a habit of eating such nuts. Presumably they were left on the carpet by someone who had called somewhere round the time of Wickham’s death.”\n\n“You’re thinking of this man Jackson?” queried Hawke, stepping across the room to examine a vase of flower-stems whose heads, for some reason, had been clipped off.\n\nSome of the broken blooms were scattered over the top of the piano, and there were others on the carpet.\n\n“Wickham didn’t stint himself when it came to furnishing,” said the man from Dover Street, stooping to examine the rich pile carpet.\n\nHe pointed to a series of indented lines on it, as though someone had scraped a hobnailed boot over it.\n\n“Somebody has been treating it unkindly,” he remarked. “Iron-shod boots, do you think, or—”\n\nHawke looked up quickly at the flower vase, and then stepped out through the French windows, where he spent some moments examining tubbed evergreens and picking up fallen leaves and twigs.\n\nHawke and Tommy accompanied the inspector to Jackson’s house.\n\nWickham had been in the upholstery and furniture-making business, and Jackson had been employed in one of his two warehouses.\n\nJackson was a diffident little man, and lie gave his visitors a fervent assurance that he had neither scattered peanut shells over Wickham’s carpet nor put poison in his whisky glass.\n\n“I was only there a few minutes,” said Jackson. “Mr. Wickham was annoyed at me callin’, and ’e sort of ’ustled me out. ’E said I must find better employment, as my wage wasn’t enough to keep a family of five on.” “It didn’t occur to him to give you an increase?” queried Hawke.\n\n“Well, you see, ’e explained that a job only ’as a certain economic value, an’ if ’c was to pay more than what that worked out to, ’e’d be givin’ me charity, which I shouldn’t wish.\n\n“I asked ’im if ’c couldn’t take me on again just temp’ry, but ’e said ’e couldn’t ’ear of it. ’E d engaged a young feller in my place who was just married.\n\n“’I’m dead against slums,’ he said. ‘You know of my work for slum clearance. And my views on people who have large families on inadequate incomes arc very strong. I’m afraid I have no use for your kind. Good-night.’ That was in ’is private study, with the French winders. They was open, an’ ’e shows me out that way. I goes down the path and out through the back gate.”\n\n“What time was that?” asked Hawke.\n\n“’Bout ten. It was getting dark. When I got to the gate I saw the light switched on. I looks round and sees ’im sittin’ at ’is desk pourin’ ’isself out a glass of whisky.”\n\n“Thanks,” said Hawke. “I don’t think we need bother you any more. If there’s anything I can do to help you get your job back—”\n\n“Oh, no,” said the man, brightening. “I got fixed up. Different work to what I bin doin’, but it’s all right. Mr. Wickham’s brother offered me the job. Rough carpentry at ’is boarding kennels over at Ditchley.”\n\n“Wickham’s brother?”\n\n“Yes. Mr. Arnold Wickham.” Jackson chuckled nervously for a moment.\n\n“Peculiar sort of chap, Mr. Arnold Wickham is, but they say ’e’s easy to get on with, once you know ’im. Tall, thin, fierce-lookin’. Swears a lot. ’E called ’ere and told me ’e’d ’card ’is brother ad given me the push, and ’e could give me a job at ‘is place. This mornin’ ’e called. I start to-morrer.”\n\nHawke was frowning thoughtfully at his informant.\n\n“Alderman Wickham was on his own when you called last night?”\n\n“Yes. I didn’t see nobody else there.”\n\n“And this Mr. Arnold Wickham, your new employer? How often do you see him?”\n\n“Oh, not very often. ’E’s a sleepin’ partner in the Alderman’s business. Funny chap, as I say. Didn’t seem to think a lot of ’is elder brother. Different as chalk an’ cheese they was.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Man with the Whip\n\nJackson’s view of Arnold Wickham was confirmed, on their return to Myrtle Lodge, by members of the party there.\n\nThe rotund, bearded gentleman spoke of him as “somewhat eccentric,” and others exchanged doubtful glances when he was referred to.\n\n“A trifle—er—wild and irresponsible,” said one woman. “Poor Aider- man Wickham had a lot of trouble with him. He’s—er—difficult to reason with. One might almost describe him as—well—peculiar. ”\n\n“Does he wear riding-breeches and leather leggings?” was Hawke’s odd query.\n\n“That’s the man,” was the answer.\n\n“Carries a dog-whip?”\n\n“Yes, you’ve seen him all right. He’s never without the dog-whip.”\n\nThe lady turned to talk to someone else.\n\n“Have you seen him, Hawke? ” queried the surprised inspector.\n\n“No, but I’m going to.”\n\n“How did you know about his appearance?” queried Tommy, as he drove his employer towards Ditchley.\n\n“What else do you expect of a professional dog-breeder?” said Hawke smiling.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nA Biter Bit!\n\nDitchley was a little-known village some twenty miles away, and they found Arnold Wickham’s place after some difficulty.\n\nFurther indications of Wickham’s “peculiarity ” were conveyed in the heavy humour of a police sergeant who directed them to the Wickham Kennels.\n\n“Arnold Wickham?” said the officer, in answer to Hawke’s query. “Yes, of course, I know him. Who doesn’t round these parts? He’s the man who bites dogs. Take that lane on your left.” It was growing dark when they reached the kennels.\n\nHawke opened a wire-frame gate and led the way along a muddy path until he reached a group of wooden sheds, from where he sighted a brick bungalow, almost hidden from view by trees and shrubs.\n\nTheir progress towards this was heralded by the barking of dogs within the sheds and on other parts of the estate.\n\nA deep-toned growl greeted them as they reached the bungalow, and Hawke hesitated for a moment on coming face- to-face with a large bull mastiff.\n\nThe beast seemed to conclude, from his hesitancy, that he was there for no good purpose, and hurled itself straight at him.\n\nTommy jumped aside with a startled cry, and the next moment he saw his chief standing with his back to an ivy- clad wall, exerting all his strength to keep the huge, snapping jaws away from his face.\n\nHe had both hands on the animal’s throat, but it strained nearer with a succession of thrusts, growling savagely the while.\n\nTommy shouted for assistance, and he turned to see that the rear door of the bungalow stood open, and that a man in a khaki shirt and riding-breeches was watching the scene somberly, with a curious lack of concern.\n\n“Hey, you!” shouted Tommy. “Call that thing off. It’ll tear him to pieces.”\n\nThe man jerked his head to flick back a lock of hair which had hung down over his left eye, glared at Tommy for a moment, and then said something in a scarcely audible voice.\n\nThe effect on the dog was striking. It sprang away from Hawke and stood cowed.\n\n“Didn’t I tell you, Pete,” said the man, his lean face working with anger, “that you don’t have to bite people without my permission? How d’you like being pounced on and bitten when you don’t expect it, eh?”\n\nHis next action was astonishing. He flung himself down on all fours, and crawled crabwise towards the animal, growling the while.\n\n“I’ll bite you, you brute!” he muttered.\n\nThe mastiff winced and yelped as the man fastened his teeth in its flank.\n\nThen, as he swung round and stared into its face, it snuffled and licked him generously.\n\n“Let that be a lesson to you, you ruffian,” said the man, chuckling and fondling its ears as he sprang upright.\n\nHe seemed in no way anxious to satisfy the astounded callers that, he was simply a person with a boyish sense of fun and not a lunatic.\n\n“That’s the way to train dogs,” he said, eyeing Hawke truculently from head to foot. “Bite ’em!”\n\nHe slashed the ground with a flexible-handled leather dog-whip.\n\n“Are you Mr. Arnold Wickham?” queried Hawke.\n\n“Yes. You a lawyer or something?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then watch out you don’t annoy me in any way, or I shall let Pete take a bite out of you. Have a peanut,” ho added surprisingly, digging a handful from his jacket-pocket. “No? Well, I will. I like ’em—always carry some.”\n\nCracking a shell between his fingers, he turned and led the way indoors.\n\nHawke and Tommy, after an exchange of questioning glances, followed him.\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n“Untoward Circumstances”\n\nWithin the brightly-lit and well-furnished sitting-room Hawke handed over his card. It had an electric effect on the man.\n\n“A detective!” he shouted in an oddly gleeful manner. “You’re investigating the circumstances of my brother’s death, eh? Now sit down there at the table and let’s listen to your deductions. Was he murdered? He ought to have been, of course, but the point is, was he?”\n\nHawke eyed the man in momentary surprise.\n\n“What makes you think he may have been murdered?” asked Hawke. “No one, apart from the doctor, the police inspector, and myself, is aware of any untoward circumstances—”\n\nArnold Wickham threw back his head and laughed.\n\n“Then there arc untoward circumstances?” he roared. “I knew there would be,” he went on, thumping the table with his clenched fist. Then, standing up, he continued:\n\n“The public weal, my friends, has always been my first care. I think I may claim I have always stood for uplift. Feed the minds of the working classes. It’s much cheaper than feeding their bodies.”\n\nHe sat down abruptly at the table again and screwed up his face.\n\n“That was my big brother,” he said. “A past master in the art of bigotry. An enemy of freedom. A slave-driver, and a mealy-mouthed hypocrite.” Arnold Wickham paused for a moment.\n\n“Well?” he demanded. “Is there any reason why such a gentleman as that shouldn’t be—but tell me your deductions.”\n\nThere’s nothing very remarkable to tell,” said Hawke. “It became apparent to me that someone had been standing inside that room, and outside on the porch flicking a whip. There were marks of the lash on the carpet, flower heads had been flipped off, and the shrubbery had been slashed.”\n\n“That’s very good. Then you heard of me, eh?”\n\n“Yes. As you have obviously been in that room since it was last tidied up, which means you must have been there at about the time of your brother’s death, some sort of explanation is called for from you.”\n\nWickham nodded vigorously.\n\n“Yes, sure! I killed him. You must now take me away and have me hanged, because I really did kill him.”\n\n“How?” asked the criminologist, without any show of excitement.\n\n“Well, you see, it was like this. I hadn’t any say in the running of the business, but I was frequently hearing of hardships inflicted by my brother, and I used to give myself the pleasure, from time to time, of calling on him and telling him he was a rat. D’you follow?\n\n“I was there when that fellow Jackson was shown in. I stood just outside amongst the shrubs, and heard the conversation. Made my blood boil. He treated Jackson like dirt instead of like a human being.\n\n“I stepped inside the room after Jackson had stepped out, and stood back against the wall, registering contempt.\n\n“After I’d reminded my brother of the filthy way he treated his employees and his tenants, I was infuriated to find it taking no effect. He just sat there complacently, with a kind of reproving, forgiving, big-brother smile on his face.\n\n“I just had to take that smile off his face somehow, Mr. Hawke, or I’d have exploded.\n\n“I had a bottle in my pocket containing a solution of strychnine. I’m a qualified vet, you know, and the stuff was for medicinal purposes.\n\n“Pulling it out of my pocket, I showed it to him.\n\n“‘There,’ I said, ‘that’ll spoil your amusement. Strychnine — in your whisky. Can you taste it yet? Wait a minute. Wait till you feel the pains. It’ll tear the heart out of you.’ ”\n\n“But you hadn’t put any in his whisky?” queried Hawke quickly.\n\n“No. Of course I hadn’t. It was bluff. I wanted to throw a scare into him, and I succeeded, by thunder!\n\n“He jumped up from his chair, went white, and then collapsed.\n\n“I took one look at him and then went off to fetch Dr. Wilthorpe, who lives just across the road.\n\n“As I approached .the doctor’s gate, he came rushing out, and he was shouting to his wife behind him as he came. ‘ It’s Wickham,’ he shouted. ‘ His butler’s just telephoned.’\n\n“So I walked quietly back and stood on the porch, watching him as he made his examination.”\n\nAn agonised look appeared in Arnold Wickham’s eyes, and he clenched his knuckles.\n\n“When I heard him tell the butler that my brother was dead,” he said, “I accused myself of being his murderer. I’d killed him by the power of suggestion. That strychnine was as good as there.\n\n“Don’t you understand, man? I had as good as poisoned him with strychnine!\n\n“It was right that I should bear the full responsibility of having poisoned him, wasn’t it? I’ve always done what I considered right all my life. Never shirked the consequences.\n\n“So, as soon as the others had left the room, I slipped in and tipped some of the stuff into the dregs of my late brother’s whisky. It was, of course, just a material triviality that was necessary in order to bring the thing down to the level of a jury’s understanding.”\n\nHawke shook his head.\n\n“I’m afraid the world’s much more stupid than you think,” he said.\n\n“What? Do you mean I shan’t be hanged for what I’ve done?”\n\n“You won’t even be prosecuted,” said Hawke. “The coroner might give you a bit of a choking off for being hysterical, but that’s all that will happen.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nGentle Pete!\n\nArnold Wickham seemed to be quite despondent when Hawke was leaving.\n\n“Perhaps I can make up for my sins by giving the staff a better deal in future,” he said.\n\n“I’m sure you will,” said Hawke. The detective staggered back as the mastiff bounded at him again.\n\nThis time the gloomy Wickham did not call it to order.\n\n“Go on, Pete,” ho said. “He denies a fellow his right to be hanged. Bite his head off.”\n\nThe dog had Hawke down, and, to Tommy’s intense alarm, appeared to be carrying out this instruction.\n\nWickham stood by, smiling faintly. That smile seemed sadly out of place to Tommy until he realised the truth.\n\nHawke struggled to his feet, rubbing his face with a handkerchief and patting the dog on the head.\n\n“His tongue seems to be about a yard long,” he said. “He licked all round the inside of my collar, nearly down as far as my shoulder-blades. I confess I was alarmed at first.”\n\n“Pete never hurt anybody in his life,” said Wickham. “Wish I could say the same.”\n\n“The punishment he’s handing himself in the form of self-reproach,” said Hawke, on the way back, “fits the crime all right. But I hope he doesn’t overdo it.\n\n“Overlooking his posing and his extravagant behaviour at times, I feel that the world has need of many more people like him, and far fewer like, say, that bunch of seedcake nibblers at Myrtle Lodge.”\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"

      "content_html": "\n  \n    Table of Contents\n  \n\n\n  Circumstantial Evidence\n  The Appearance of Innocence\n  Maybe I Killed Her\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nCircumstantial Evidence\n\nIf any one around Headquarters was making a book on a Murder Handicap, I’d lay 100-to-l that Joe Gillen was guilty. A vicious and premeditated homicide, at that. But Howard—that is, Det. Chief Gwynn Howard—never said a word until the morning of the second day.\n\nMeanwhile, Gillen was sobering up in the county jail across the street. Now, I’m no wizard at detectival deduction. I also know that circumstantial evidence can likewise be screwy.\n\nBut the records will show that most murder cases are cracked via circumstantial evidence; and if it wasn’t for such evidence a flock of homicidal hams would be acting in more murders.\n\nBut no matter from which angle you viewed Joe Gillen, he looked like the Murder of the Month Club selection for the sizzle seat. And the evidence was more than circumstantial: it was also self-confessional, or practically so. If Gillen wasn’t guilty, then Adolf Hitler had nothing to do with World War 2, as I saw it.\n\nI found Howard alone in his office, adjacent to the temporary detention cell. It was 8 a.m. Howard never said much, and gave strangers the impression that the most important thing in his life was filing his fingernails. His left foot was usually draped over a corner of the battered desk, while a cigarette dangled from the right corner of his mouth. He smoked from mere habit, not because he liked it.\n\n“Gillen talk yet?” I asked.\n\n“Made a sort of confession. Even thinks he may be guilty of killing his wife.”\n\n“Thinks!” I snorted. “Why, the guy was caught by two squad-car men as he tossed the carved torso into the river. Thinks! Why, the man must be nuts.”\n\nHoward smiled lightly and examined his nail file like he had just discovered a convicting fingerprint. “I admit it looks like a wrap-up case,” he said, “but, Bub, you never can tell.” He called everyone “Bub”, from the chief of police to the newsboy on the corner. “Don’t forget that Gillen was drunk when caught.”\n\n“Is booze an excuse for killing your wife, or anybody else? It’s getting so that every man, or even woman, who gets in a jam with the law, tells the judge he has been drinking. And it’s never more than two bottles of beer. It’s time to change the record; that booze one is cracked.”\n\n“Liquor is no excuse,” said Howard. “But men and women will do things under its influence that they wouldn’t have the nerve to do while sober. Gillen has not admitted that he killed his wife. He does admit that he carved up her torso and threw it into the river.”\n\n“Now that,” I said, “is very nice of him to admit. He’s just telling us what we already know. Did he have any more fairy tales?”\n\nHoward took three sheets of typed paper from his desk. “Here’s the official statement from the gentleman,” he said. “He was able to talk about 4 a.m.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Appearance of Innocence\n\nI read the confession. Briefly, Gillen stated that he and his wife, Mary, had been drinking in their small frame cottage.\n\nIt was one of the rare cool days when the Miami temperature went down to 40 degrees. They began to quarrel. Over what they argued he could not recall; probably over nothing, as usual.\n\nIn the small kitchen was a little potbelly iron stove. He put in some paper and charcoal and lit a fire. Then he went to a divan in the front room and fell asleep, his wife sitting in the rocker near the fire. This was about 4 p.m., as near as Gillen could remember.\n\nHe awoke about 11 p.m. His head was splitting and he was altogether groggy. He went to the kitchen, lit the light, and found his wife still sitting in the rocking chair. He called her a vile name; she did not answer. He shook her by the shoulders and she fell to the floor, motionless. He leaned over her and listened to her heart. There was no beat; he then knew she was dead.\n\n“I became scared,” he stated. “I knew the neighbors had heard as fighting and they would all accuse me of killing her. I don’t think I touched her, but I can’t remember very much. I knew the police would accuse me of murder. I just lost my head, and—well, you know the rest.”\n\nI passed the confession back to Howard. “A very touching tale,” I said. “He could write some of that detective goo I hear on the radio. I still say he killed her, whether he knew it or not.”\n\n“The examination showed no signs of a blunt instrument on any part of her body,” said Howard. “No gun wounds or even knife stabs.”\n\n“What do you mean, no knife stabs? He carved her up, didn’t he?”\n\n“True, Bub, but there was no signs of one-shot knife stabs. It was all good, clean carving. At one time, the guy must have been a butcher, he was handy with a knife.”\n\n“If he didn’t kill her, it was two other fellows with the same name. He had to admit he carved her up because he was caught with part of the torso in the bag. Right now he’s just playing the old game of Chair-Ducking, hoping to win life instead of the Big Jolt.”\n\nHoward examined the file very carefully. “Look, Bub,” he said, “when you’ve been in this crime-chipping game as long as I have you’ll learn that a criminal investigator has two duties. One is to prove guilt and the other is to prove innocence.\n\n“Personally, I’m not wholly positive that Gillen killed his wife before dismembering her body. Years ago, before the creation of modern criminal laboratories, Gillen would have been railroaded to his death.\n\n“No one really knows how many innocent persons, men and women, have paid the extreme, official penalty for crimes they never committed. But times have changed, Bub; when a person wins a rope around his neck or seat in the One-Way Chair, you can make book that he is guilty.”\n\nI scratched my head and said, “Well, what are you waiting for now?”\n\n“Doc Vollmer’s report. He’s been checking the remains and also the Gillen house.”\n\n“I bet Doc says he’s guilty,” I said.\n\n“Maybe so, but you may recall the Joel Hammond case. You had just come on the force, about ten years ago, and you were working in the uniform division. Well, Hammond appeared innocent, and even the first editions of the papers made him a burglar-shooting hero. But the morgue subject wasn’t a burglar. At the time Mrs. Hammond was vacationing in North Carolina with her parents.”\n\nHoward put the nail file on the desk and went on. “The dead guy was named Raymond Nolle. Anyway, around midnight Hammond phoned Headquarters from his house and said he had just shot a burglar. We found a young man of about 30— who was Nolle—lying on the floor, with a .45 slug through his heart. It was a lucky shot. Hammond was still in his pajamas and his bed was disarranged, indicating he had been sleeping.\n\nHe explained to us that he had been sound asleep when a draft from the open window awakened him. Then he saw a male form in front of his bureau. He reached under his pillow, got his gun, and fired. Since he claimed he fired in the dark, it was a good shot. In fact, too damned good.”\n\nHoward picked up the file and went to work on his right thumbnail. “Well, Bub, Hammond’s story sounded reasonable until I flashed a light into the eyes of the dead Nolle. I found that his pupils were very small; you know what that means?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“It proved Hammond was lying. The lights were on when Nolle was shot. Moreover, he had been shot with planning and deliberation on the part of Hammond.”\n\n“You mean the eyes of the dead Nolle showed you that?”\n\n“Exactly,” replied Howard. “In death, the size of the eye-pupils does not change. Nolle’s were very small, proving they had been contracted when he was killed. Light contracts, darkness expands. So I arrested Hammond for murder.\n\nTwo days later he confessed that he had asked Nolle to call on him, believing Nolle was having an affair with his wife. Subsequent facts proved his jealousy was both unfounded and silly. Dumb? Double dumb.”\n\nI started for the door, stopped halfway and asked, “Do you mind if I call on Brother Gillen for a little chitchat?”\n\n“Help yourself. You’ll find him in the county jail, with his head in his hands, no doubt.”\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nMaybe I Killed Her\n\nGillen sat on the edge of his cot, with his head in his hands. He was a stupid looking guy, with a half-moon head of hair—half hair, half bald. He told me he was 42 and worked, when he worked, as a carpenter’s helper.\n\n“Ever work in a butcher shop?” I asked. His green-gray eyes looked at me like that of a scared fawn.\n\n“Nope; never worked in a butcher shop. Why ask that?”\n\n“Polite conversation. Skip it.” He covered his face with his hands and began to cry. Have you ever seen a full-grown man cry? It makes you feel kind of silly and yon begin to wonder if we’re not all babies in a pinch, no matter how old we get.\n\n“Maybe I killed her and maybe I didn’t,” he said, “so help me God, I don’t know!”\n\n\n\nNext morning Howard called me into his office.\n\n“Your odds on murder have flopped,” he said. “Horses and murders are usually bad bets.”\n\nHe tossed the nail file in the air and caught it with his left hand. He was in excellent humor. The forehead wrinkles, which always crease his when he was working on a case, had vanished. “Doc Vollmer says Gillen never killed his wife, whether he thinks he did or not. And Doc knows his stuff.”\n\n“You mean Doc proved something that Gillen couldn’t prove himself?”\n\n“That is correct, Bub. Vollmer has proved that Gillen never killed his wife.”\n\n“Did Vollmer prove that it wasn’t Gillen who carved her up and tried to throw her into the river?”\n\n“He didn’t try, Bub. That’s another angle and Gillen is guilty of the carving business. But—she was dead when he started to slice her. So he is not guilty of murder. You can’t kill a person twice.”\n\n“Just how did the Doc prove it?”\n\n“By a spectroscopic examination of what was left of Mrs. Gillen. She died from carbon monoxide gas from the potbelly iron stove; it nearly got Gillen but he didn’t know it.”\n\n“What reward will he get for his carving ability?” I asked.\n\n“I’d say ten years in the state pen.”\n\n“Which is better than the Chair.”\n\n“Much better,” said Howard.\n\n~ The End ~\nBack to Top\n\n"
