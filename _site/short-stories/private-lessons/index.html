<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="the-situation">The Situation</h3>

<p>From the window of the little brick bank Rufus Tench could see most of
Sparta; his glance included the dingy courthouse in the delta of the
road on one side, and the frame station between the two warehouses for
cotton and tobacco on the other—a somnolent, threadbare little county
seat, already beginning to drowse through the blazing day, although the
sun barely had lifted above the roof the Mackrimmon House, and a broad
belt of shadow lay along the farther side of the highway.</p>

<p>Mr. Tench frowned as he inspected the familiar setting; Sparta
perpetually offended his sense of fitness, and the offense deepened as
his attitude became more and more proprietary. He resented the deep dust
of the road, the paintless buildings, the languor of the few inhabitants
who were visible, the air of apathetic shiftlessness which lay over the
village as perceptibly as the film of summer dust which grayed the sod
and shrubs about the courthouse.</p>

<p>Properly managed, Sparta might have been busy, prosperous, alive, like
the faraway towns Mr. Tench remembered. There was plenty of money to be
made here; the surrounding country had proved fertile, and no rival
settlement was within a radius of fifteen miles. Rufus Tench had chosen
it with an eye to these conditions; he had made a good thing of his
little private bank, very largely because his brisk energy set him apart
among the drawling, shambling natives. In one of those bustling
communities he thought of, it would have been harder to start a bank,
harder to make it pay, harder to retain a monopoly of the business.
Rufus Tench was perfectly aware of this, but, because he had come to
feel that Sparta belonged to him, he was ashamed of the characteristics
which had mainly contributed to that result.</p>

<p>He scowled as he watched two slouching darkies shuffle across the road
from the jail in the basement of the courthouse, carrying a huge basket
between them. If Mr. Tench had held the contract for feeding the
prisoners there would be money in that empty basket; he was irritated by
the reminder that Sheriff Dan Mackrimmon pampered the jail inmates on
regular hotel fare, instead of giving them their bare legal allowance.</p>

<p>His eye followed the pair to the corner of the rambling wooden building
which housed the hotel, and rested speculatively on the two-story porch
which masked its streetward face. It could be a little gold mine, that
hotel, if a businessman owned it. When the court was in session every
bed was in demand; even during the dullest months there were a few daily
visitors, marooned in town between the morning train from the main line
and the afternoon “mixed” back. And the jail contract alone would pay
expenses.</p>

<p>He would not have regarded the double galleries so bitterly if Sheriff
Mackrimmon had been enjoying the revenue which Mr. Tench had estimated a
hundred times. It was the knowledge that Mackrimmon barely made ends
meet, which exasperated him. The sheriff just about supported himself on
the proceeds of his several activities: the meager fees of his office,
the slender margin of profit on the jail contract and the hotel itself,
the occasional windfall from the livery he operated in connection with
it. Mr. Tench would have made every one of those sources more
productive, and the daily contemplation of a potential gain going
placidly to waste had come to seem almost an affront.</p>

<p>Mackrimmon wouldn’t sell, even at a figure well above the presumptive
value of his property. He would not consider incorporating himself and
permitting Mr. Tench to secure an interest. He was contemptibly content
to drift along, earning a bare living from a business which ought to
have made him rich.</p>

<p>The shoofly train groaned to a halt at the station. Mr. Tench watched a
little group descend from the single coach, his eye sifting out the
aliens from the homing native traveler. He scowled more acidly than ever
as he saw the five salesmen march along the strip of shade to the hotel,
instead of scattering at once to their work. It was after eight, and
these men had been riding nearly an hour, but they had waited for
breakfast, nevertheless. Mr. Tench knew why: at the Mickrimmon House
they could buy a dollar meal for fifty cents. Mackrimmon couldn’t seem
to realize that prices had gone up!</p>

<p>He stood in the window, thinking wistfully of what he could do with such
an opportunity, hugging his contempt for the sheriff and the community
which tolerated him. His lips tightened and drew down as he saw
Mackrimmon leave the courthouse and come toward him, a great, swollen
figure in faded blue serge, a rusty, wide-brimmed black hat casting a
shadow like a mask across the upper part of his red, plump face. The
man’s very walk was shiftless, he thought. But the frown faded when he
realized that the sheriff was headed for the bank, and guessed his
errand. There was a solace in the thought of the coming interview.</p>

<p>Mackrimmon nodded gravely and said good morning in a slow, thin drawl.
The banker answered briskly.</p>

<p>“Well, sheriff, what can we do for you? Decided to sell me that hotel,
after all?”</p>

<p>Mackrimmon shook his head, without a smile for the mouthworn jest.</p>

<p>“I wanted to talk to you about that Lovatt sale, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s set for today, is it? I’d forgotten—” Mr. Tench assumed the
expression of one preoccupied by a multitude of concerns.</p>

<p>“No—tomorrow. But I’m kind of busy, and I wanted to talk to you
beforehand.”</p>

<p>“What about? There’s no hitch, is there?” Mr. Tench spoke sharply.</p>

<p>“No, sir. That’s all right. But I come over to see if you wouldn’t let
up on young Jeff a mite. Seems like it’s kind of hard on him to lose the
place, after the way he’s worked on it.”</p>

<p>“It is hard on him—of course. It ought to be. A man who buys land
without having the title searched, and then neglects to record the deed,
deserves to suffer smartly, sheriff. What about it?”</p>

<p>“I know’ the law, sir. It’s on your side, sure enough. Your title’s
good, and Jeff’s ain’t, and it’s your land, according to the court. But
Jeff don’t see it that way. Looks to him like you and the law had
cheated him. And he’s worked right hard for three-four years on that
place—cleared the scrub and planted peaches—”</p>

<p>“Sit down, sheriff. I want to explain this thing to you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench placed a chair importantly. Mackrimmon shook his head.</p>

<p>“Reckon I’ll stand, sir. But I’m listening.”</p>

<p>“Just as you like. You sympathize, I take it, with young Lovatt, or you
wouldn’t be here pleading his case. I want you to understand why I’m
insisting on my rights. It’s not money, sheriff—it’s principle.”</p>

<p>He achieved the expression of conscious virtue with which he invariably
accompanied the useful word.</p>

<p>“You’ll agree, I think, that if you didn’t arrest lawbreakers, and if
the court didn’t punish them, we’d have a great many more crimes than we
do. I mean that mercy would be bad for the community, perhaps bad, too,
for the offender himself. He’d go on breaking laws until he got himself
into worse trouble.”</p>

<p>“That sounds like sense, sir. But young Jeff—”</p>

<p>“You’ll say that he hasn’t broken any law. That’s exactly my point,
sheriff. He has. He’s broken a law that’s older and stronger than any
statute on your books. He’s been a fool. And the law of nature herself
is that a fool shall suffer for his folly.”</p>

<p>The sheriff pondered this deliberately. “Maybe it’s like you say. But on
the other hand—”</p>

<p>“Stop and think. If I let young Lovatt escape the just consequences of
his neglect and stupidity, as you want me to, I suppose, I should
encourage him in this folly. He wouldn’t learn anything by this
experience. And I should encourage others like him in similar
foolishness. By standing on my rights, I teach him that it comes high to
be a fool, and I teach the whole community that same lesson.”</p>

<p>“You aim to take the place away from him, then?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me—that’s not the way to put it. I intend to keep what the law
says is mine. The place never belonged to young Lovatt. He only thought
it did.”</p>

<p>The sheriff nodded. The door behind him opened, and a man came in, a
neat, alert young fellow in linen clothes—one of the arrivals on the
morning train.</p>

<p>“Don’t let me interrupt, gentlemen. I’m in no hurry.” He stood back, as
if withdrawing, removed his hat, and turned to look out of the window.</p>

<p>“Then I reckon it’s no use me talking to you,” said Mackrimmon slowly.
“As long as it ain’t the money you’re after. Principle’s different. If
you feel like it’s your duty to put Jeff off his land, I expect you got
to do it. I’m right sorry. Jeff’s going to be kind of hard to arrest.”</p>

<p>“Arrest?” Tench lifted his brows again. “You must misunderstand. There’s
no criminal charge against him. He’s possibly guilty of technical
trespass, but I haven’t any intention of making such a charge. You have
only to dispossess him, formally—”</p>

<p>“I know all that. They’s no charge against him now. I was lookin’ ahead,
sir. You go through with this, and I’ll be arresting Jeff right quick.”</p>

<p>“What for?” The banker scowled. “Why, for murder, sir. You don’t think a
hill boy like Jeff Lovatt’ll leave you take his farm from him and not do
anything about it, do you? I expect you don’t know the breed, sir.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Tench spoke impatiently. “I’m not afraid of anything like
that. He’s not fool enough to risk hanging for a bit of spite—”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Mr. Tench, but wasn’t you just saying that he was a fool,
and that you had to learn him not to be? He’s this kind of a fool, sure
enough. And when you take that land he won’t have nothing to lose. I
notice a man shoots quicker when he’s got nothing ’n where he’s well
off. Jeff’ll sure try to kill you. And he’s right apt to hit what he
aims at, sir.”</p>

<p>The stranger half turned, Tench saw. The banker tried not to believe
Mackrimmon’s even, drawling speech, but a persistent memory brought
young Jeff Lovatt’s face before him, long narrow, lean, the cheeks
concaved, the eyes deep-set and dark and steady. He broke out hotly.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine statement to come from the sheriff of the county. If you
think he intends to kill me it’s your duty to prevent it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. That’s why I’m here. The only way I know of keeping Lovatt
from killing you is to go easy on him, or kill him first. I can’t lock
him up on suspicion. I’d have to wait till he got you and then go after
him. And that’d be a mean job, Mr. Tench—yes, sir. Right mean. I know
Jeff.”</p>

<p>“I take you to witness that this amounts to intimidation!” Tench
appealed to the stranger. “Here is the sheriff practically threatening
me with murder if I don’t surrender my unquestioned legal rights!”</p>

<p>“You can look at it like that, if you’re a mind to!” Mackrimmon nodded.
“I’m only telling you what I know. Suppose you take Jeff’s note for what
you’re out of pocket on this deal, and give him a clean title to the
place. Wouldn’t that be better’n waiting for a bullet the first time
Jeff got a good bead on you? Teaching fools is all right, Mr. Tench, but
it looks sort of risky to me.”</p>

<p>The stranger met Tench’s eye over the sheriff’s shoulder. Mr. Tench
distinctly observed a faint, droll droop of one eyelid. It puzzled him.</p>

<p>“I suppose I’ve got to,” he said sulkily. “Bring me his note, and I’ll
have the deed ready. But I won’t forget this, sheriff. You’ve threatened
me, acted as spokesman for a man you admit is practically a murderer—.”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome to remember it, sir. I do the best I can. And I hate
killings in my county. We ain’t had one for quite a spell. I’ll fetch
you that note right away. I got young Jeff over at the hotel.” He
plunged a great hand into a sagging coat pocket and exhibited a cheap
revolver. “Lucky I saw him first, Mr. Tench. A six-gun and a grudge and
a quart of blockade liquor mix mighty mean in a hill boy. Good mornin’,
gentlemen.”</p>

<p>He slouched heavily out, leaving a thick silence behind him. It was the
stranger who broke it, in a cautious, significant whisper.</p>

<p>“You’ve dropped a bit of coin, Mr. Tench. How’d you like to get it back
—with some interest?”</p>

<p>Tench surveyed him shrewdly, his grievance retreating instantly as the
hint of a business transaction challenged his sagacity. His lips drew
back from his teeth in a flat, mirthless grin.</p>

<p>“I thought so. You don’t want me to cash a check, do you? Because I
wouldn’t! What’s your game?”</p>

<p>The stranger chuckled. “The same as yours, Mr. Tench. Teaching fools the
high cost of foolishness. I make it pay me. Want it to pay you?” Mr.
Tench gestured toward a chair. “Sit down and go on,” he said
noncommittally. But his eyes glittered.</p>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="the-scheme">The Scheme</h3>

<p>The other crossed his legs comfortably.</p>

<p>“I expect to do a little business with some of the farmers around here,
and I’m going to take their notes. I’ll want to discount them—quick.
That’s where you come in.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench grinned faintly, but he did not permit his caller to see it.
His guess, he saw, had been accurate. This man used his wits actively.</p>

<p>“I see. And what do I get for obliging you?”</p>

<p>“A flat fifty-fifty split. Thirty-day paper. You choose the signers
yourself. That’s part of it. Tell me a few names that are good for real
money, and I’ll do the rest.” Again his eyelid drooped slightly.</p>

<p>Mr. Tench meditated. He had heard often enough of such transactions, but
it had never happened that one had been proposed to him till now. He
knew that the innocent third party in a swindle occupied an unassailable
legal position. And his lips went dry at the thought. Even when one
could charge twenty per cent a year for a loan, it was slow business,
with a small capital. Here was fifty, in thirty days!</p>

<p>“That sounds rather good,” he said quietly. “Good. What’s the scheme?”
The stranger regarded him shrewdly. “How much of it do you want to
know?”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench grinned. “Begin, anyway. I’ll tell you when to stop.”</p>

<p>“Oil stock, that’s all. I sell ’em ten-dollar shares for ten cents, and
take their notes in payment. That enough?”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench frowned. “You think you could sell any stock to these people
back here? You couldn’t give them government bonds!”</p>

<p>“That’s my job. I’m betting I can. If I don’t, you’re nothing out. If I
do, you’re in just half what I get. You can’t lose, either way. Just
leave that part of it to my silver tongue.”</p>

<p>The banker saw the force of this and caught the undertone of confidence
in the man’s speech. This fellow knew that he could sell that stock. He
must have some special method, or he wouldn’t be so sure.</p>

<p>“How do you work it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m a good salesman, for one thing. And I get to ’em by leasing
their own land, first. Pay ’em spot cash for a five-year oil lease. Sell
’em stock for a thirty-day note. Don’t worry about my end of it. I can
attend to that.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench saw through it instantly. That lease would have to be signed
by the lessor, and his wife, too, probably. And when it had been cut
along the proper lines it would become a simple promissory note,
perfectly collectible at law by any innocent third party. It was, in
short, nothing but the ancient swindle of the seed-oats contract,
modernized and improved. He chuckled as he saw the beautiful simplicity
of it. Everybody felt sure there was no oil within a hundred miles of
Sparta; to be offered real cash for utterly worthless oil rights would
seem to these hardworking farmers like a sheer windfall. They’d bite—and
bite hard.</p>

<p>“Let’s see your lease,” he said shortly. The other hesitated.</p>

<p>“Sure you want to? All you know now is that I told you I was selling oil
stock and offered you good paper for discount that I said I’d taken in
payment. Better let it go at that, hadn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Who’s going to tell what I know or don’t know? Let me see the lease.”</p>

<p>The stranger produced a printed sheet of fine type and spread it on the
desk. Mr. Tench went through its clauses methodically. He had seen oil
leases often enough to recognize this as a usual form. Only at the
bottom, where blank spaces had been left for figures and signatures, did
he find any departure from the ordinary. He saw the break between the
words where the scissors would cut; the note form stood out like a
framed inscription.</p>

<p>“That seems quite regular,” he said dryly. “But I don’t think we can do
business, Mr. —”</p>

<p>“Layton,” said the other. “And you’re dead wrong. We can do business,
and we’re going to. This is a quick turnover—the softest money you’ll
see in a lifetime—and the safest.</p>

<p>You don’t risk a cent. And—”</p>

<p>“I don’t like it. It’s not in my line.”</p>

<p>“I won’t split any better than fifty- fifty,” said Layton tartly. “No
use trying to boost me that way.”</p>

<p>“I’m not interested,” repeated Tench. He meant it. He had steered fairly
near the wind in the matter of the usury laws, but this was different.
No scruple restrained him, but fear was more potent. This was fraud;
safe, as it seemed. He ached for the easy profit it offered, but he was
afraid.</p>

<p>“That’s too bad.” Layton half closed his eyes. “I was rather counting on
you. You’d like a chance to get back at the sheriff, wouldn’t you? I
thought I’d begin with him. I heard he had a little farm outside of
town—”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench jumped. “You mean you’d have the nerve to try it on him?”</p>

<p>“Would I? Why, I’m going to charter him and his buggy to drive me around
to see the others. I’m going to make him help me sell ’em. When the
plug’s pulled he’ll be holding the bag and looking foolish, too! You
watch me!”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench leaned forward. “I’ll do it,” he said huskily. “Take down the
names. Daniel Mackrimmon up to—up to fifteen hundred. H. D. Fraser, a
thousand; Lawrence Neil, a thousand and—”</p>

<p>“That’s enough,” said Layton presently. “I’ll be in with the notes some
time this afternoon. Have the cash ready.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench nodded. A brilliant idea came to him, and he instinctively
avoided Layton’s eye, lest his own reveal too much.</p>

<p>He saw Layton cross the road to the hotel, and a few minutes later
Mackrimmon brought over Jeff Lovatt’s note for a thousand dollars, with
a quitclaim deed for Tench’s signature.</p>

<p>Mr. Tench signed it almost happily.</p>

<h6 class="btt"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h6>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="the-deal">The Deal</h3>

<p>“Son, I need the money, but I’m bound to tell you they ain’t a drop of
oil anywheres around here. It’s plumb foolish to fool with this idea you
got.” Mackrimmon wagged his head.</p>

<p>Layton chuckled.</p>

<p>“That’s my lookout, sheriff. If I want to throw my money away, it
shouldn’t worry you.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not. But I wouldn’t feel right about leavin’ you throw it away
into my pocket, son.”</p>

<p>Layton hesitated. He leaned toward the other confidentially.</p>

<p>“I see I’ll have to tell you, after all. But I wish you’d keep it quiet,
if I do. It’s just a gamble, of course, like any oil speculation, but it
looks good to me. I’ve had a man scouting around here, making sure, and
I’m putting a small bet on his report. I don’t know that there’s oil
here, but I think there is—think so hard enough to risk a little change
on leases and trial wells. Now you know where I stand.”</p>

<p>“You’ll lose it,” persisted Mackrimmon. “The best oil folks have looked
us over—”</p>

<p>“And they’ve overlooked a good many other winning bets, too. Don’t you
worry about me, sheriff. I’ve been in this game quite a while, and it’s
paid me good money right along.”</p>

<p>The sheriff inspected him attentively over the lifted lower lids of very
bright blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, if you feel that way about it, I reckon I can stand it if you
can. Let’s see the lease.”</p>

<p>Layton exhibited the printed form, and Mackrimmon read it carefully. He
nodded. “It looks all right to me, son, but I reckon I better take it up
to Judge Keever and leave him go over it. You don’t object to that, do
you?”</p>

<p>“Glad to have you. I’ll save argument with the others if you’re
satisfied that it’s all right.” Layton spoke heartily.</p>

<p>Mackrimmon plodded away, returning, after a quarter hour, with Judge
Keever’s assurance that the lease was entirely in order. He signed it,
forming the letters clumsily.</p>

<p>A barefooted negro boy fetched a horse and buggy to the front door, and
the two men climbed into it, the sheriff taking the reins. As they drove
down the main road Rufus Tench stood in the bank window, watching.
Layton did not glance at him.</p>

<p>“Pretty sharp customer, that banker of yours,” he said.</p>

<p>“Reckon so, son. Rufus Tench is mighty near as sharp as he thinks he
is.” He chuckled. They drove out of the village over a deep-rutted sandy
road which wound between fields of cotton and tobacco and lifted over
ridges crowned with thrifty orchards of young peach trees.</p>

<p>Before noon they had made two calls and secured signed leases at each;
the sheriff, to Layton’s relief, advised his constituents to accept his
offer.</p>

<p>“It’s twenty-five dollars sure, Kobe, and a seventh of all the oil they
find on your place, and you get the rights back in five years if they
don’t strike oil before then. Judge Keever advised me to lease my place,
and I done it.” He drew up at a rickety cabin in a hollow, after leaving
the Fraser farm.</p>

<p>“You didn’t say nothing about leasing this here land, son, but I reckon
you ought to have it, and Sim Pittenger he needs the money right bad,
too.” Layton shook his head. “Don’t want it. The report doesn’t mention
him. His land doesn’t lie right, I’d say. Better get on—want to finish
up in time to catch that afternoon train out, sheriff.”</p>

<p>Mackrimmon did not argue the matter, and they reached the Neil place at
dinnertime, sharing a meal in the open gallery between the two wings of
the farmhouse and signing another lease before Neil went back to the
fields.</p>

<p>It was drawing on toward four o’clock when they reached the town again.
Layton mopped his neck with a wadded handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ve got time for a quick bath before the train goes,” he said.
“I’ll take a room—”</p>

<p>“No need to waste the money, son. You’re welcome to use the bathroom.”</p>

<p>“Want room to dress in,” Layton said, laughing. “You ought to soak me
for it, sheriff. You hotel folks have to make your money when you can.”</p>

<p>The grinning darky shambled around the corner of the porch and took the
bit while the two climbed down. Layton laughingly insisted on renting a
room, and Uncle Jimmy Stygall, interrupting his afternoon perusal of
yesterday’s paper, laid aside the thick reading lens with which he
helped his purblind eyes, and stumped upstairs to pilot him. The sheriff
lowered himself to a wide chair in the dusky coolness of the office,
folded his hands across his stomach, and let his head droop forward.</p>

<p>Uncle Jimmy found him so when he came back, and did not interrupt him.
He read diligently, the thick handglass lifted almost to his nose, the
newspaper hardly an inch away from it.</p>

<p>“You’ll wear them eyes plumb out, Uncle Jimmy,” said the sheriff mildly.
“Have one of them headaches if you don’t quit.”</p>

<p>The old man grumbled, but yielded, laying the glass on the counter
beside the register.</p>

<p>Layton came to the inner door. He was in his shirtsleeves.</p>

<p>“Say, sheriff, what’s the matter with your lights? None of the bulbs
upstairs seem to work.”</p>

<p>Uncle Jimmy snickered. “Ain’t nothing the matter with them lights. Come
sundown they’ll work, all right. What’d anybody want of a light in the
daytime?”</p>

<p>“I like to shave by electric light,” said Layton quickly. “Not till
sundown, eh? What time is that?”</p>

<p>“Lights go on at seven,” said the sheriff without looking up. “Have to
let the pond fill up, daytimes, ’r they wouldn’t be no power at all.”</p>

<p>Layton hesitated. “Oh, well, it doesn’t matter. I’ll get along without
the shave.” He stopped. “What time does that train go, did you say?”</p>

<p>“Five-four,” said Uncle Jimmy. “You ain’t got much time for a bath,
mister.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take a quick one.” Layton disappeared, and a hissing sound in the
pipes presently announced that the tub was filling. The two men sat in
the darkened office, the sheriff nodding over his folded hands. There
was a long silence. Then Uncle Jimmy said:</p>

<p>‘‘Fine thing! Lights in daytime! ‘Like to shave by one,’ the feller
said! Never heard of such a fool business!”</p>

<p>“It ain’t so foolish as it sounds, Uncle Jimmy.” The sheriff still spoke
mildly. “You take and lay down a spell, while I tend the office. I got
some thinkin’ to do, Uncle Jimmy.”</p>

<p>The old man shuffled away, and the sheriff resumed his meditations. He
glanced up at the noisy clock from time to time. At five o’clock there
was still no sign of Layton, and Mackrimmon stumped to the foot of the
stairs.</p>

<p>“Hey, son! Train starts in four minutes.”</p>

<p>A violent splash answered him. Then Layton’s voice:</p>

<p>“Gad! I forgot all about it! Can’t make it, now! Have to take the next
one.”</p>

<p>“That’s tomorrow morning, you know.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! That’s too bad! I wanted to get the express north. Say, sheriff,
couldn’t you drive me over to the main line, after supper? That train
doesn’t go up till eleven something, and it’s only twelve miles, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Guess I could.” Mackrimmon nodded. “Have to charge you pretty high,
though.”</p>

<p>Layton laughed. “That’s all right— stick me all you please. I deserve
it!” The sheriff went back to his chair. His eyes sagged shut, and he
sat very still, a feeble grin showing at the corners of his mouth. He
was still sitting so when Mr. Tench closed up his bank and came across
the road to supper.</p>

<p>Mr. Tench was in a bad humor. He had spent nearly two hours looking out
of his window at the doorway of the hotel and waiting for Layton to
appear. He scowled at the drowsing sheriff and stalked past him, going
upstairs to his room. There was no sound from the lower floor, as he
waited in the upper hall, listening. He identified Mr. Layton’s room by
a cheerful whistle from behind its door, and he tapped carefully at the
scarred panels.</p>

<p>Mr. Layton thrust a bath-wet head into the hall, and shook it warningly.</p>

<p>“After supper,” he whispered. “I got him, all right, but we better play
it safe. He looks pretty soft, but you can’t always tell.”</p>

<p>Tench grumbled under his breath, but his eye lighted, nevertheless, at
the news that the sheriff was hooked. He possessed his soul in as much
patience as the circumstances permitted, while he waited for the brazen
summons of the supper bell. His thoughts were pleasing.</p>

<p>If the sheriff had really signed a presumptive note for any considerable
sum, Mr. Tench’s ancient ambitions concerning the hotel were already
well on their way toward fulfillment. When the note came due there would
be no cash to meet it; there never was any cash in Sparta unless it was
borrowed from Rufus Tench. And it wasn’t likely that any outside bank
would care to loan money on a property like the hotel. It couldn’t show
a profit, on paper or otherwise, under the sheriff’s management. Nobody
except Mr. Tench himself saw any possibility of gain in its tumble-down,
paintless building. The property would go under the hammer, as a good
many others had gone since Mr. Tench had come to Sparta.</p>

<p>He grinned acidly at a bright mental picture of Sheriff Mackrimmon
engaged in selling out Hotel-keeper Mackrimmon, to satisfy the judgment
which that note would surely yield. And he foresaw, too, that the
sheriff would loudly protest when the trap closed, and thus reveal
himself to the community as a person of such simplicity that he could
hardly be considered a fit occupant of such an office as he now held.
Everybody would laugh at him; Mr. Tench was comfortably certain of this.</p>

<p>The liberal supper he consumed presently, he resented as if it
represented a loss to his own pocket. When the hotel belonged to him he
would speedily alter this wasteful habit of overfeeding guests at a
ridiculously low figure. He’d fire those old darkies who wasted money in
the kitchen, and put in a businesslike cook the first thing. And he’d
send that doddering old fool Uncle Jimmy packing off to the Veteran’s
Home, too. He was just a dead weight on the business.</p>

<p>A little paint, he told himself, and some new furniture, not too
expensive, would bring the place near enough to modernity to warrant
doubling its present schedule of prices. He’d make it show a pretty
profit from the first week.</p>

<p>His impatience brought him to Mr. Layton’s elbow the moment the meal was
over, and the stranger left the table for a cigarette on the gallery.
Layton shook his head again.</p>

<p>“Wait till dark,” he whispered. “You be over at your office in about an
hour, and I’ll drop in when it’s safe. You don’t want to figure in this
thing any more than you have to.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench saw the force of this advice. The fewer circumstances
indicating a close acquaintance between himself and Layton, the safer
the subsequent proceedings must be. He crossed the road and unlocked the
bank door. It was beginning to darken, now, and the filament in the bulb
over his desk glowed to a feeble red as he pulled down the green window
shades.</p>

<p>He unlocked his safe and extracted a compact sheaf of worn bills, which
he laid on his desk and counted lovingly. Most bankers would have
returned money in this condition to the treasury, but Mr. Tench hated to
think of a bill being destroyed. He liked the look and feel of old bank
notes far better than of new; there was an effect of value in soiled,
crumpled bills which endeared them to him. New money represented nothing
but the government’s assertion of worth; old, hand- worn notes somehow
had acquired an intrinsic value. They stood for the labor by which
calloused hands had wrung them out of the earth or nimble wits won them
from trade. Mr. Tench caressed the rough surfaces affectionately as he
counted. One bill had been torn almost across, and he stopped his count
long enough to repair it carefully with neatly scissored strips of
gummed paper.</p>

<p>A thousand dollars, in fives and tens and twenties, made quite a
respectable bundle, he thought. It was a pity to spend it. Perhaps he
could avoid even that, if he was clever about it. The strategic
advantage in the coming interview lay altogether with him. Layton was
nothing but a common crook, who couldn’t run any risk of exposure; Rufus
Tench was a respectable and honest banker, whose position was legally
unassailable. Why should he throw away a thousand dollars when a hundred
would suffice?</p>

<p>He meditated leisurely over this idea, finding it more and more
appealing. By the time a quiet tapping at his window glass announced the
arrival of his fellow conspirator he had definitely decided to try it.</p>

<p>Mr. Layton sidled nimbly past the edge of the door, his keen face alert.</p>

<p>“Must hurry, now. I’ve got the old boy out of the way, hitching up to
drive me over to the main line. Let’s hustle. Here you are.”</p>

<p>He put a handful of documents on the counter. Mr. Tench snatched at the
uppermost one. He could see where it had been cut from a larger sheet.
The margins were so narrow that the type nearly fell over the edges, but
it was a note, in due legal form, for fifteen hundred dollars, and it
bore the signature of Daniel Mackrimmon. Mr. Tench was wholly familiar
with that awkward, clumsy script. His fingers trembled a little as he
held the paper.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a total of four thousand there,” said Layton. ‘‘Hurry up,
brother—there’s no time to lose.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench deliberately examined the remaining notes. They were all in
order, and each signed by a man perfectly good for the amount. He knew
that he could force collection of every penny of their value, or, if he
was obliged to take judgment and levy on property, he could probably
collect a great deal more than the face of the notes. It was not a
speculation, but a sure thing.</p>

<p>“I been thinking it over since this morning,” he said, “and I don’t feel
like going into it. It’s too dangerous.” Layton’s eyes narrowed, and his
lips tightened flatly over his teeth.</p>

<p>“I was waiting for that,” he said quietly. “I suppose you figure that
you can only afford to pay about fifty cents for this little wad of
paper, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want it at any price,” said Mr. Tench,</p>

<p>“You don’t, eh?” Layton’s eye glimmered oddly. “You were never more
mistaken in your life! You want it so badly that you’ll pay me sixty per
cent of the face, instead of fifty. And another crack like that will
cost you another ten-per-cent boost. Trot out the coin and quit
bluffing. You’d buy that Mackrimmon note at par, if you couldn’t get it
cheaper. I know your number, Tench. Think I make my living out of this
game without spotting a cheap crook when I meet one? Come through!”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench made a feeble attempt at bluster. Layton interrupted him
tartly.</p>

<p>“Seventy per cent, now. And in ten seconds more it’ll be eighty. Come
on!”</p>

<p>“I—I can’t. I’ve only got a thousand dollars on hand,” quavered the
banker. He did not like the ugly glint in the other man’s look; crooks
were dangerous people, he remembered. Men had been killed for less money
than lay in his desk drawer.</p>

<p>“Hand it over,” said Layton curtly. Mr. Tench, observing that one of his
hands rested conveniently in the pocket of his coat, tremblingly opened
the drawer and produced the bills.</p>

<p>“Now the other thousand—and quick,” said Layton.</p>

<p>Mr. Tench protested, quite truthfully, that he had no more currency on
hand. He had taken the precaution to put the rest of his cash under the
safe, so that when he opened it and allowed Layton to look for himself,
his statement had a color of fact. The swindler glanced at his watch,
hesitated.</p>

<p>“All right. You get by with it,” he said, and snarled. “But you’ll wish
you hadn’t, before I’m done with you. I’ll come back here and trim you
right, one of these days.”</p>

<p>He thrust the bills into his inner pocket and sidled out. Mr. Tench
watched him through a gap in the curtain as be crossed the road and
entered the hotel. He reappeared almost at once, climbed into
Mackrimmon’s buggy, and was driven briskly down the road and out of
sight. Mr. Tench lovingly recovered his cash from below the safe and
locked it away, with the precious notes. He was distinctly pleased with
himself. He’d made a cold profit of three thousand dollars— a thousand
more than he’d expected. It was the best day’s work of his career.</p>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="the-payoff">The Payoff</h3>

<p>Mr. Tench was still awake when Sheriff Dan Mackrimmon came in after his
twenty-four mile drive. It was almost morning, but the banker had not
been able to sleep for thinking of the sheriff’s face when that note
should be presented for payment. His mind was full of plans for the
reconstruction of the hotel, when it should come into his hands at the
auction sale which that note would precipitate.</p>

<p>He heard Mackrimmon come up the creaking stairs, and he felt his face
twist into its nearest approach to a smile. The sheriff was humming
faintly, under his breath, a plaintive negro hymn.</p>

<p>“<em>You won’t see me here again;<br />
Goin’ to heb’n onna mornin’ train.<br />
My sin been taken away!</em>”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench chuckled. The sheriff never lapsed into music except when he
was in excellent humor. Probably Layton had paid him five dollars for
that all-night drive, thought Tench, and the old simpleton was all
swelled up over such a profit!</p>

<p>He overslept and came down late for breakfast, in a sullen humor.
Mackrimmon greeted him with his usual reserved courtesy, and the banker
growled in answer. In thirty days he’d have a pretty bomb to explode
under this fat, stupid fellow!</p>

<p>The time passed slowly, while he waited for the calendar to bring him
his triumph. The last week of that month seemed endless; every meal he
ate at the hotel impressed him as a deliberate theft from him. In any
live town that much food would bring a dollar or more; it was
assassinating value to feed casual travelers so. Sometimes he almost
protested, and restrained himself only by a sharp effort.</p>

<p>On the thirty-first day he stopped at the office on his way out.</p>

<p>‘‘Oh, sheriff—there’s a little note of yours due today. I’d like to have
you drop in and settle it, if it’s perfectly convenient.”</p>

<p>Mackrimmon regarded him placidly. “Reckon they’s some mistake, Mist’
Tench. I ain’t signed nary note.”</p>

<p>Tench smiled thinly. “I’m afraid you have, sheriff. I’ve got one which
is certainly signed by you. Drop over and see for yourself.”</p>

<p>He went out, hugging his exultation. He had rehearsed the coming
interview over and over, as he waited for today to come. He knew exactly
what he would say when Mackrimmon came over to the bank.</p>

<p>At ten the sheriff’s big form appeared in his doorway. Tench bustled
over to his safe and extracted the envelope in which he had filed the
notes.</p>

<p>“Here we are. sheriff. Take a look at that!”</p>

<p>Mackrimmon bent over the paper. Tench watched him happily, waiting for
the explosion he was sure would come. But Mackrimmon only nodded slowly.</p>

<p>“I kind of thought it might be that,” he said. “When I see that feller
in here in the mornin’, and come over again after supper—that oil
feller, I mean—I had a notion he might be goin’ to do business with
you.”</p>

<p>“Oil?” Mr. Tench lifted his brows. “This man brought me some perfectly
good paper, which I discounted for him, but I don’t remember anything
about oil. Hold on, though—he did tell me that he’d taken the notes in
payment for stock in some company; it might have been an oil company,
too. I hope you haven’t been speculating, sheriff. Oil stocks are risky
investments.”</p>

<p>“That’s how he worked it, eh?” Mackrimmon nodded. “I was wonderin’ what
story he’d give you. O’ course a smart man like you. Mist’ Tench,
wouldn’t buy paper from a stranger without some pretty good yarn to
explain it. He didn’t sell no stock—all he wanted was leases, and he
paid cash for ’em. I was with him eve’ywhere he stopped. These notes
ain’t notes at all—reckon he must have clipped ’em out of them leases.
I’ve heard of such games before now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Mr. Tench bit off the words.
“The note’s in order, and I’ll need the money, sheriff. I hope you’re
ready.”</p>

<p>He stared as the sheriff produced a thick roll of bills.</p>

<p>“I did come over here to pay a note,” said Mackrimmon gently, “but I
reckon I won’t pay this here one, sir. I didn’t sign it—all I signed was
a lease for the oil rights out to my farm.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to do with that. I’ve bought this paper in good faith,
and I must insist on your settling it, or I shall be obliged to protest
and sue. I need the cash for other investments.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t, if I was you, sir.” Mackrimmon spoke very quietly, but a
curious hardness appeared in his blue, gentle eyes. “If I was you, sir,
I’d put them notes back in my pocket and say nothin’ to nobody about
them. You know it’s a swindle, sir. You must have knowed right along
that we-all never signed any such papers. It wouldn’t look neighborly
for you to help a stranger cheat us folks around here, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench laughed shrilly. “That’s good! I’m to lose four thousand
dollars because you people have been foolish enough to bite on some
crooked scheme! You tell me that this man wanted oil leases, eh? Well,
why did you take his money when you knew there was no oil there? You
thought you were cheating him, eh? And he’s cheated you. It serves you
right!”</p>

<p>“Maybe.”</p>

<p>Mackrimmon’s broad, pink face settled to its normal placidity. “You aim,
then, to sue on these here notes? You aim to help this slick feller
swindle us home folks?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do mean to collect what’s due me. If you’ve been fools you
deserve to suffer. I’ve told you before how I stand on that, sheriff.
It’s my duty as well as my right to collect these notes—it’ll teach you
and the others not to be so easy next time. You’re not being
cheated—you’re paying for your education. A wise bird like Sheriff
Mackrimmon caught on that moss- grown swindle! I don’t see how you can
afford to have this get out, sheriff! You’d better settle quietly, and
keep your job. You’ll be laughed out of it if the county ever hears
about this.” Mackrimmon was silent for a moment. Then he spoke slowly.</p>

<p>“You figger that’s square, Mist’ Tench? If it was you ’t had bit on a
hook like that, would it look decent and neighborly to you if the other
feller was to haul you in and string you through the gills?”</p>

<p>“Of course it would! I’m always willing to pay for my education. If I
needed to learn a lesson like this, sheriff, I’d not only pay the man
who taught it to me, but I’d thank him. It would be cheap at the price!”</p>

<p>The sheriff settled his chin comfortably on his flat collar.</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought, sir. It makes me feel all right about this here
business to know you look at it that a way. I ain’t forgot what you said
about Jeff Lovatt that time you was fixin’ to take his land off’n him.
Guess it comes high to get sense, sometimes. But as long’s you’re
satisfied, I reckon eve’ybody is.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about, sheriff.”</p>

<p>“No? Well, I reckon I can make it clear, if you give me time. You
remember that oil feller’t sold you these here notes? He tackled me
first off to sign that there lease of his’n, and right then I kind of
smelled a rat. I knowed they wasn’t no oil in this county, and I told
him so. But he said he was willin’ to risk it. So I took Uncle Jimmy’s
readin’ glass and had a look at the lease. It was all right. I took it
up to Judge Keever, and he said it was safe to sign. So I done it, and
let four-five other folks do it, too.”</p>

<p>“That’s got nothing to do with me. It may be as you say, but it doesn’t
matter. All I know is that these notes are perfectly legal, and that—”</p>

<p>“Wait. This feller was in a mighty hurry to get back to town in time to
catch the shoofly back to the main line that same afternoon. He kep’ me
driv-in’ along right fast. But when we got to the hotel what does he do
but hire a room and start in to take a bath? Funny, eh? What’d you think
if you’d been me?”</p>

<p>“It has nothing to do with me .”</p>

<p>“Maybe it has. I’m gettin’ there, sir. You jest wait a mite. This feller
Layton went up to his room. But he come down again in a minute and
wanted to know why the lights wasn’t on. I told him we only had lights
at night, and he looked sort of mad, but he went back upstairs and
started in to take his bath. Stayed in the tub till train time. That’s
how come he missed it, and stayed over for supper. Got me to drive him
over, remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, no doubt. But all this is quite beside the po sheriff.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. You see, Mist’ Tench, when he started talkin’ ‘bout a lease to
me I figgered that he must be up to some trick ’r other, and right away
I thought of the old swindle they used to work, years ago—get a feller
to sign some perfectly harmless paper and then cut it in half and have
an iron-clad note! But me and Judge Keever we looked all over that lease
of his’n, and they wasn’t no way it could be cut so’s to make a note
out’n it. I saved the one he give me. You can see for yourself.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench barely glanced at the printed sheet. He guessed that the
astute Mr. Layton had furnished a harmless specimen for purposes of
examination, and secured his signatures to a slightly different
document.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about all this. It’s nothing to do with me,
sheriff—”</p>

<p>“Not even when I told you he wanted a light—in the middle of the
afternoon, and missed his train, so’s to stay here till the lights come
on? I’m right disappointed in you, Mist’ Tench. I sh’d think a thing
like that’d make you guess right off that he was up to somethin’. It
only took me a coupla days to figger it out, and I ain’t what you’d call
smart.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Mr. Tench was vaguely aware of a sudden coldness in
the pit of his stomach. Lights? What had lights to do with this?</p>

<p>“I guess I know now how he done it,” said the sheriff. “I found the
glass loose in a picture of General Jackson ’t hangs in the room he had.
Kind of simple trick, too. He got us to sign them leases, and then he
carried ’em up to his room and laid that pane of glass on a coupla books
or somethin’ so’t he could plug the light connection and run a light
under the glass. Then he jest spread a lease on the glass, laid one of
these here note forms over it, and traced the signatures, as easy as
winkin’. I’ve read about that trick, but I never seen it done.”</p>

<p>He fumbled in his breast pocket and drew out Uncle Jimmy’s thick-lensed
reading glass.</p>

<p>“Take a look at that writing, Mist’ Tench! See how the lines is made up
of a lot of little strokes? Nobody never signed his name that a way.
It’s a plain forgery, and I reckon, if this gets to a co’t, we all c’n
prove it.”</p>

<p>Little beads of sweat broke out on Tench’s face as he stared at the
magnified signatures and confronted the realization that he had no
possible redress at law, except against the vanished Mr. Layton.</p>

<p>“I’m right glad you ain’t complainin’, Mist’ Tench, because it’d only
make folks think you wan’t much of a banker,” drawled Mackrimmon’s
gentle voice. “An’ maybe you’re right about a lesson coinin’ cheap at
the price. I reckon you won’t have to learn this one again, sir.” His
eyes narrowed. “What floors me, sir, is the way he fooled you. That
writin’ don’t look very good. I been wonderin’ whether you wasn’t maybe
expectin’ him to bring you some notes like these here—expectin’ so hard
that you didn’t look at ’em close. But that’s jest guessin’, o’ course.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench’s mind moved quickly. He couldn’t afford to complain too much,
or other people would ask exactly that question. A thousand dollars—he
quivered at the thought of losing it. But there was no help for it. And
the sheriff’s next speech brought him a measure of comfort.</p>

<p>“The note I thought you was wantin’ me to pay was different, sir. I come
over here to see you about that paper of Jeff Lovatt’s. It ain’t due
yet, but if you’re a-wantin’ to get in some cash I’d jest as lief buy it
off’n you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tench stared. Buy it? Where? How? But he couldn’t speculate about
that now. A chance to recoup his losses was too precious to be missed.
He fetched the Lovatt note, and the sheriff tendered a thick wad of
bills. Mr. Tench counted them, his fingers shaking.</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked up, and his mouth opened. One of the bills had been
torn half across and carefully mended with gummed paper. His memory
groped toward a sudden, incredible suspicion. The sheriff had driven
Layton over to the train, with this very money. He caught his breath for
an accusation, and then, under the unwinking gaze of the placid, blue
eyes, he realized the hopelessness of it.</p>

<p>He signed the note as paid and slid it over the counter. The sheriff
folded it deliberately and sighed.</p>

<p>“I guess we-all have learned somethin’ out’n this here business, Mist’
Tench. You can buy right smart experience with a thousand dollars, sir.
I wonder how much this here thousand’s done paid for, sir.”</p>

<p>And he slouched away, leaving Mr. Tench to guess at the reason why he
had come home singing, after that night drive over to the main line, and
to wonder whether Mr. Layton had also secured a thousand dollars’ worth
of education out of that excursion. As for himself, although he had
emerged exactly even from the two transactions, he resolved that he
would take no more private lessons from Sheriff Daniel Mackrimmon. Not
at any price!</p>
