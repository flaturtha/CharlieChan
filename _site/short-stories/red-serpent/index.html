<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="podkin--dead">Podkin — Dead</h3>

<p>Professor Harvey Forrester drew a white silk handkerchief from the
breast pocket of his primly untidy jacket and industriously polished the
lenses of his neat, rimless pince-nez. Then he replaced the glasses on
his thin, aquiline nose and stared disgustedly at the pile of
examination papers before him.</p>

<p>“Idiots!” he muttered. “Numbskulls! Imbeciles! I took particular pains
to impress the fact that the remains of the Proto-Egyptians are
preserved because they were buried in the hot, dry sand, and that
embalming wasn’t practiced to any extent in prehistoric times, yet every
paper here says — ”</p>

<p>Br-r-r-ring — r-r-r-ring! The shrill, sharp chime of his telephone bell
cut short his oration.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he barked, snatching the receiver from its hook.</p>

<p>The soft, low rasp of somebody breathing laboriously came distinctly
over the wire, then: “Rosalie speaking, Uncle Harvey,” a soft, rather
high-pitched voice announced.</p>

<p>“Yes?” Though Professor Forrester was not aware of it, the strident note
of ill temper had faded from his tones, and his thin, stern features had
softened perceptibly at the sound of the girl’s voice. “Yes?” he
repeated. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“Uncle Harvey — ” again the soft, gasping interruption to the words —
“can you come over here right away, please? I’m at Professor Podkin’s.
Professor — Podkin — is — dead!”</p>

<p>“Eh?” Forrester returned sharply. “Podkin — dead? Good heavens! Yes, of
course; I’ll be right over.”</p>

<p>Pausing only to snatch gloves, stick and hat from the hall-rack as he
hurried to the door, the Professor swung across the campus toward the
adjacent village where his friend and colleague, Jonas Podkin, lay dead.</p>

<p>“Poor Podkin; poor chap!” he kept repeating as the ferrule of his cane
beat time with his sharp heel-clicks on the frosty ground. “Poor fellow,
poor old Pod!”</p>

<p>I always told him that ‘appetite of his would be his death some day!”</p>

<p>“The pretty little cottage where fat little Professor Podkin had lived
and worked among his beloved books on Zend and Sanscrit, and had finally
yielded up his life, presented the conventional scene when Forrester,
almost breathless from his hurried tramp, mounted the front steps.
Several kindly, helpful neighbors whispered together in the hall,
somewhere upstairs a woman wept softly; the family physician, with the
professionally sympathetic look reserved for such occasions, ruffled a
sheaf of papers at the library desk, his fountain pen rapidly filling in
the spaces reserved for statistical information in the death
certificate.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he informed Professor Forrester as they shook hands, “it was
sudden. Acute indigestion, you know. These heavy-set fellows, with a
fondness for indigestible foods, usually go that way, sooner or later.
Too bad; very sad case; so unnecessary, too.”</p>

<p>He scratched the figures “56” in the blank marked “age” as Forrester,
treading softly, turned and mounted the stairs.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Podkin — ” Forrester took the widow’s trembling white hand in both
his, then paused, his earnest look and tear-filled eyes continuing his
message of condolence and promise of help more effectually than any
spoken words.</p>

<p>“Th — thank you. Professor Forrester,” she faltered. “I can hardly
realize it. Jonas seemed so well at luncheon. You know — ’’ she wiped
her eyes furtively and bit her lips in a vain effort at self-control —
“you know, he’d been feeling unwell for several days, and today was the
first time he seemed to care about eating anything. We had just the sort
of luncheon he liked, too calf’s liver and bacon — and he ate with such
an appetite. Then he went into the study to lie down for a while before
going on with his work, and when I went in to waken him at four o’clock
— he — he was in convulsions!” Her restraint gave way utterly and she
bowed her head on her hands while her shoulders shook with sobs.</p>

<p>Forrester patted her arm with awkward kindness. “Yes?” he prompted
gently, feeling instinctively she would find relief in discussing the
tragedy.</p>

<p>“I ran in to him,” she went on, drying her eyes, “and called, ‘Jonas!’
and he seemed to grow worse at the sound of my voice. Just as I turned
to run from the room I heard Doctor Delaval coming up the front walk,
and rushed out to him. He came right in and did what he could for Jonas;
but it was too late. My poor darling died while we were trying to get
Doctor Hondell on the ’phone.”</p>

<p>“U’m?” Forrester wrinkled his brow. “Who is Doctor Delaval? I’ve heard
Jonas speak of him, but I don’t think I’ve ever met him.”</p>

<p>“He’s an Orientalist,” she responded, “very much interested in Yoga. He
and Jonas were working on some sort of codification of the system. I
didn’t understand it very well, but they were together a great deal, and
Jonas was giving more and more time to it. Indeed, it seemed to me,
sometimes, he neglected his university work for Doctor Delaval’s.”</p>

<p>“U’m?” Forrester repeated. “Did I understand you to say he tried to help
Jonas?”</p>

<p>“Yes — oh, yes! He’s a physician as well as a scholar, you know, and
happened to have a case of medicines with him today. He gave Jonas an
injection of strychnine, and it seemed to revive him for a moment, but —
but the dear boy was too far gone for anything to help, and — ” again
the hot tears drowned her words, and Forrester gave her shoulder another
reassuring pat as he turned from the room and sought his ward.</p>

<p>“All right. Uncle Harvey,” the girl whispered as he beckoned her. She
threw her arms about Emma Podkin and gave her a parting kiss of sympathy
as she followed the Professor out into the chilly April twilight.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>They strode along the tree-bordered street in silence, busy with their
thoughts. Finally the girl whispered, “Uncle Harvey, will you promise
not to laugh?”</p>

<p>“Eh?” Forrester came out of his brown study and blinked owlishly at her
through his glasses. “Laugh, child? I don’t feel like laughing. I — ”</p>

<p>“I mean,” she interrupted, “please don’t laugh at what I want to say. I
— I don’t like it.”</p>

<p>The Professor regarded her narrowly. She was a remarkable young woman,
this eighteen-year-old ward of his. The offspring of an American soldier
and a Filipino mother, she had been sold into slavery by a villainous
uncle shortly after her parents’ death, and had served years of
apprenticeship in a den of Singapore criminals before Forrester found
and adopted her. Intensely American, loving her father’s people with a
love that was almost idolatry, she had not yet learned to speak English
well enough to control her vocabulary in times of stress, and the
Professor wondered if her odd statement were the result of inability to
express herself as he answered questioningly, “You don’t like what,
child?”</p>

<p>“The way Professor Podkin died. I had luncheon with him and Mrs. Podkin
and Emma, you know, and he seemed well enough while we were at table,
and — ”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Forrester interrupted soothingly. “He had acute
indigestion, my dear. It comes on as suddenly as heart disease, and
doesn’t often give its victim much warning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but — there was something odd about the way Doctor Delaval
attended him, sir. Professor Podkin had taken off his house coat and
covered himself with a rug before he lay down on the study couch to
sleep, and the window was open a few inches from the bottom — the couch
was directly under the window, too, for he said he liked the fresh air
to blow over him as he slept. When Mrs. Podkin came screaming from the
study, Emma and I ran in, and Doctor Delaval cam in with Mrs. Podkin a
moment later. He had a little medicine case with him, and, though I have
seen him at the Podkin house many times, that is the first time I ever
saw him carry such a case. It seemed to me he already had a syringe
filled with something, for he hardly seemed to hesitate a moment before
he rolled the Professor’s sleeve up and shot something into his arm. And
— ” she paused a moment, as though to marshal her words or bring her
memory into line before continuing — “he injected whatever it was into
Professor Podkin’s left arm.”</p>

<p>“Well?” Forrester asked, faintly amused at her earnestness.</p>

<p>“That was the arm nearest the window and farthest from him. It would
have been easier for him to shoot his injection into Professor Podkin’s
right arm; but he didn’t. He pulled the couch out from the wall a
little, closed the window, and slipped in between the couch and the wall
before he rolled the Professor’s sleeve up and applied the medicine.”</p>

<p>“U’m!” Forrester mulled over her information while they walked a hundred
feet or so. “That is queer, Rosalie. Mighty queer. People do some odd
things when they’re excited, I know; but you’d think, if the man is a
physician, constant practice would have taught him to choose the nearer
arm. I — wonder — if — ”</p>

<p>“What?” she prompted, leaning nearer and slipping her gloved fingers
through the crook of his elbow.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing. I was just wondering if he chose the left arm in order to
make the strychnine injection work faster. However, I’ll call Hondell on
the ’phone as soon as we get home.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to have to upset your theory, my dear,” he told the girl an
hour later as he finished a brief colloquy with Doctor Hondell, “but
everything seems quite all right. Hondell verified the fact that Delaval
injected strychnine, and nothing else, into Podkin’s arm, and tells me
it was one of the best things he could have done for him, but the poor
chap was so far gone that even strychnine couldn’t keep his overworked
engine going.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Rosalie responded. But the stubborn line of her flowerlike mouth
as she bent her blonde, bobbed head over her embroidery frame showed she
had not abandoned her suspicions, no matter how damaging the family
physician’s opinion might be to them.</p>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="the-insurance-policy">The Insurance Policy</h3>

<p>“Hello, Professor!” the young man greeted cheerfully as Forrester
answered the vigorous ringing of the front doorbell three nights later.
“Do you know me?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” the Professor replied after a quick, shrewd scrutiny of the
other’s features. “You’re Carter, ’25; and a very good student you were,
too, even if you did always insist that the Proto-Egyptians — ”</p>

<p>“Oh, have a heart, sir!” the other besought with a laugh. “Can’t we let
the dead past bury its dead in the dust of Egypt? May I come in?”</p>

<p>“Surely,” Forrester held the door open courteously for his guest, then
led the way to the drawing-room. “Rosalie, this is Mr. Carter, one of my
former students; Mr. Carter, this is my ward, Miss Osterhaut.”</p>

<p>Customary amenities exchanged, Professor Forrester proffered a cigar to
his caller and stuffed his own pipe to overflowing with a generous
handful of black, long cut tobacco. “What are you doing these days,
Carter?” he began, by way of opening conversation.</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” the other returned, puffing appreciatively at an
excellent perfecto. ‘‘That’s just what’s the matter, sir. I’m working
for the National Life Insurance Company, and doing mighty well at it.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” Forrester congratulated. “But if you’re trying to sell me a
policy — ”</p>

<p>“Not a chance!” Carter scoffed. “I know you too well. Besides. I’m not
in the selling end. I’m a claim investigator. I’d like to get some
information from you, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’ll not be much good as an actuary — ” the Professor began,
but the insurance man waved his protest aside.</p>

<p>“I’d like to get some data on Professor Podkin’s death. You were at the
house a few minutes after it occurred, I understand.”</p>

<p>Forrester stiffened slightly in his chair. “Do I understand you intend
contesting Professor Podkin’s policy?” he asked.</p>

<p>“We-el,” the young man hesitated a moment, “I’m not sure we’d be exactly
justified in contesting it, but there’s something queer about it, just
the same. Do you happen to know a man by the name of Delaval?”</p>

<p>Rosalie, who had been playing idly with a string of amber beads — an
oriental habit of which she had never been able to break herself — let
the polished globules slip through her tapering fingers and leaned
toward the speaker. “You want to know about Doctor Delaval?” she asked,
her slightly quickened breath seeming to drive the words through her
lips with more than usual force.</p>

<p>“Be still, Rosalie!” Forrester cut in irritably. Then to Carter: “What
about him?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, he had a policy on Professor Podkin’s life for fifty
thousand dollars. Claimed he and the Prof, were engaged in some sort of
scientific research together and that he stood to lose the labor of a
lifetime if Professor Podkin died before they finished it.”</p>

<p>“Yes? Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, that might be all right, too. I don’t suppose you can get any
hard and fast monetary valuation on a man’s personal contribution to
science, and if he was actually working with Podkin, as he claims, I
reckon he’d have an insurable interest in his life. But he had a policy
on Mrs. Wilma Robertson, too. Claimed she and he were studying together
to bring some great truth or other to the world, and her value as a
co-worker was twenty-five thousand dollars. Mrs. Robertson died of acute
indigestion two months ago, and Delaval happened to be calling on her
when the seizure occurred, and tried to render first aid. Didn’t make a
very good job of it, though. He gave her a shot of strychnine in the
arm, but she was gone before her hysterical maid could find a doctor.</p>

<p>“Oh, sure — ” he glanced from the Professor to Rosalie and back again —
“everything was right as rain. Medical certificate and everything.
Doctors said the treatment he gave both Mrs. Robertson and Professor
Podkin was the best possible in the circumstances — but just the same my
company isn’t going to pay out fifty thousand iron men on top of
twenty-five in two cases so much alike until somebody’s told us how come
and why. Can you blame us?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me a moment, please?” Rosalie rose quickly from her chair and
hurried from the room.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Professor Forrester sucked thoughtfully at his pipe, staring at the
crackling logs in the drawing-room fireplace. Carter cast an admiring
glance after Rosalie, then turned his gaze fireward and joined the
Professor in pensive silence.</p>

<p>“Do you mind if I tell Mr. Carter what I told you the other day, Uncle
Harvey?” Rosalie asked as she returned from upstairs, a small parcel of
white linen in her hand.</p>

<p>“Not at all; go ahead,” Forrester nodded acquiescence, and returned to
his thoughtful study of the shifting flames.</p>

<p>Speaking slowly, choosing her words with the care experience had taught
her was necessary when employing her unfamiliar mother tongue while
excited, the girl repeated the occurrences at Professor Podkin’s house
the day he died.</p>

<p>“And here,” she announced as she concluded her narrative, “is something
else I wanted to show you, Uncle Harvey.” From the chair beside her she
lifted the bundle of linen and flung it open. It was a man’s white
shirt, much crumpled with use, but otherwise quite fresh. “See — ” she
indicated the left sleeve with a forefinger which shook with excitement.
On the outer side of the thin white fabric, at a point where the sleeve
would rest midway between its wearer’s elbow and shoulder, there was a
single tiny red stain, as though the skin beneath the linen had been
pricked with a fine pin or needle.</p>

<p>“The hypo — “ Forrester began, then checked himself, for his memory
recalled her story even as she put her correction into words:</p>

<p>“But Doctor Delaval rolled Professor Podkin’s sleeve up before he
injected the strychnine, and didn’t roll it down again. That shirtsleeve
was turned up, just that way, until the undertaker’s men came for the
body. I made sure of that by asking Emma before I begged the shirt from
her. I told you I didn’t like the way Professor Podkin died. Uncle
Harvey 1”</p>

<p>“Sister — ” Tom Carter looked frank admiration at Rosalie — “you’re a
queen if everybody could use their eyes and their beans like you do — ”
he broke off and made a vague, but vastly complimentary, gesture with
both, hands. “I’ll give this Doctor Delaval a ring tomorrow and have him
down at my office. He’ll have some tall explaining to do before he gets
any company to hand him a check for any fifty thousand smackers.</p>

<p>Forrester knocked the ashes from his pipe. “Let us know when this
Delaval person makes his appointment for the interview, will you,
please, Carter?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” the other agreed enthusiastically. “Will you sit in the game
with me, sir?”</p>

<p>Forrester’s narrow, aristocratic nostrils were twitching with
excitement, but he managed an excellent imitation of his frosty
classroom smile as he replied: “I shall not be idle, young man, depend
on that.”</p>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="doctor-delaval">Doctor Delaval</h3>

<p>“No, sir, Doctor Delaval isn’t in, right now,” the neat, colored maid
informed the Professor and Rosalie as they stood before the door of
Delaval’s Sixteenth Street apartment the following afternoon. “I don’t
know just when to expect him back, either.”</p>

<p>Forrester beamed kindly on her through his glasses. “I think we’ll wait
for him — a little while, at any rate. He was expecting us.”
Surreptitiously, as he spoke, he inserted the toe of his narrow shoe
between the door and the jamb. By the time he had concluded his
announcement he was half way through the portal, Rosalie, ever quick to
act on suggestion, close at his heels.</p>

<p>“I don’t think — ” the maid began dubiously, but the Professor gave her
no time to voice objection.</p>

<p>“We’ll wait in the living-room a little while,” he told her, passing his
hat, gloves and stick to her with the air of one thoroughly assured of
his welcome. “Come, Rosalie,” he led the way through the arched door to
the room beyond, “the doctor is apt to be home any moment, you know.”</p>

<p>His air of perfect assurance carried the day. The servant closed the
door, deposited his outdoor things on a chair and went quietly to her
quarters at the rear of the house.</p>

<p>Forrester continued his role of expected and familiar guest. Producing
his short-stemmed briar pipe, he loaded it with a generous charge of
rank tobacco, set it alight, then stared about the room with a quick,
stocktaking glance.</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous place. Every item of furnishing proclaimed it the
abode of a man of wealth, taste and refinement. The walls were hung with
a light gray paper in which an indistinct, almost invisible pattern in a
slightly lighter shade traced the design of piling cirrus clouds against
an autumn sky. The floor was covered with a marvelous Chinese rug with
coral background and figures of old blue, and low chairs, heavily
upholstered in long-napped mohair and finest needlepoint, invited the
visitor to rest. Under the arch of a Parian marble mantel a log fire
snapped and crackled behind a three-barred brass fender, while a tiny
ormolu clock with porcelain face and gilded hands beat off the minutes
with sharp, musical clicks. Pictures in profusion lined the walls — a
landscape by an apt pupil of Corot, one or two Botticellis, a dark
Flemish interior by Frans Hals, and a single, life-sized portrait of the
face and shoulders of a mediaeval gentleman above the mantel.</p>

<p>The likeness was done after the manner of Tiziano of Cadore, no detail
left to the beholder’s imagination, every item portrayed with
photographic fidelity. The subject was a man in early middle life, light
haired, blue-eyed, with full, red lips and a look of gentle melancholy
softening his pale, austere features. As far as could be seen, he was
dressed in a doublet of white satin thickly sewn with seed pearls, and
about his neck hung several golden collars, emblems of knightly orders.
But his beard was his outstanding characteristic. In sharp contrast to
his hair and mustache, which were almost blond, it was jet black, yet,
by some trick of the artist’s colors, perhaps, it showed a bluish tinge
in certain lights, and, looking from the blue-black beard to the pensive
blue eyes above, there appeared a hint, the merest suggestion, of
wolfishness.</p>

<p>Rosalie stood beside Professor Forrester and viewed the portrait long
and earnestly. “I do not like it,” she pronounced. “He is cruel, an
animal, a beast — and he much resembles Doctor Delaval.”</p>

<p>Forrester nodded, then turned his eyes from the picture and strolled
across the room to examine a small black leather hand-case, such as
physicians use to carry their medicines.</p>

<p>Picking up the satchel, he pulled tentatively at its lock, failed to
force it, and rested the case against the marble top of the table. As he
did so, the smooth leather slipped along the polished marble slab,
colliding with a vase of drooping flowers and thrusting it backward
toward the window. There was a scraping sound, the tinkle of thin glass
striking wood, then the crash of shattered crystal, and a specimen case,
which had stood at the extreme edge of the table, concealed by the jar
of flowers, crashed to the polished floor beyond the edge of the rug.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“Drat it!” Forrester exclaimed. “Now I have done it!” He leaned over the
medicine bag, intent on forcing it open without further delay, shook his
head in vexation, and straightened abruptly, his eyes narrowed with
sudden strain. The motion of his head had dislodged his pince-nez,
leaving him almost blinded.</p>

<p>“Confound it!” he ejaculated, bending toward the floor with
outstretched, groping fingers. “I’m getting as butter-fingered as — ”</p>

<p>“Uncle Harvey, stop! Don’t move!” Rosalie’s warning was almost a scream
as she launched herself across the room, cannoning into the Professor
and hurling him backward a foot or more. Next instant she rose in the
air like a bouncing ball, brought her slim ankles together with a click
and landed heavily on the rose-colored rug, the sharp French heels of
her little black kid pumps grinding down on a spot which could have been
covered by a silver dollar.</p>

<p>“What on earth — ” Forrester demanded half angrily, as he reached into
his waistcoat pocket, found a pair of emergency glasses and thrust them
on his nose with an irritated, chopping gesture. “Have you gone
completely crazy — ah! Have you killed it? Be careful!”</p>

<p>Under the girl’s crushing heels protruded a cablelike cylinder some nine
or ten inches in length, one end twitching viciously, like the released
end of a coiled steel spring, the other lying quiescent against the rug.
Its color was a rich, deep red, almost exactly simulating the groundwork
of the carpet, narrow bands of black and yellow cutting through the red
at irregular intervals. No need to tell a man traveled through the wild
places of the world what it was that writhed beneath Rosalie’s feet.
Forrester recognized the thing instantly — now that his glasses had
restored his usual keenness of vision. It was a coral snake, the
smallest and deadliest of all venomous reptiles, and its blunt-nosed
head lay within an inch of where the Professor’s fallen glasses shone
dimly.</p>

<p>“Careful!” he repeated, placing his foot alongside Rosalie’s and bearing
firmly down on the broken-backed, but still faintly wriggling, serpent.
“Careful, my dear, there’s a lot of vitality in these little devils, and
a single touch of their fangs is death. Ah, so! I think it’s safe for
you to step back now.”</p>

<p>He gave an added pressure to his foot, made sure the reptile was
completely harmless, then withdrew his foot, staring downward
wonderingly. “What the dickens was that thing doing here?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“It was in a glass case behind those flowers,” the girl supplied. “Right
where the sun would shine on it. When you pushed the flower-vase back
you jogged the case the snake was in off the table. I wouldn’t have
noticed it against the red rug, but its head happened to be over one of
the blue figures just as you reached down, and I saw it rise to strike
you. Wah!” she lapsed into oriental speech as was her wont when excited.
“Many serpents have I seen in Singapore and India, my lord, but never
one which strikes without coiling. This worm is brother to the devil,
master!”</p>

<p>“I think you’re right,” the Professor agreed as he unfolded his
handkerchief, carefully wrapped the dead reptile in it and thrust the
grisly parcel into his jacket pocket. “Come, let’s get out of this
before Delaval comes back and finds us. I don’t think he’d relish our
killing his pets.”</p>

<p>During their short walk down Sixteenth Street, while looking for a
cruising taxi, and while they bowled home over the smooth asphalt roads
to the college suburb. Professor Forrester wrinkled his brow and wagged
his head perplexedly.</p>

<p>“Delaval — Delaval?” he repeated over and over to himself musingly.
“Delaval — where — when — ”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Dinner was finished, Amaryllis Washington, the colored maid-of-all-work,
had served coffee before the drawing-room fire, and Forrester was
solacing himself with his pipe while Rosalie puffed contentedly at her
cigarette, curled up in her chair before the burning logs like a
pussy-cat upon her cushion, when the Professor suddenly broke the
peaceful postprandial calm.</p>

<p>“I have it!” he announced, rising and striding excitedly across the
hearth till he looked directly into his ward’s startled, upturned eyes.
“I have it, my dear. I’ve been chewing on it all afternoon, but, by
Jupiter Pluvius, I’ve got it now!”</p>

<p>“What?” asked the girl wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Delaval!” he replied, as though annoyed at her obtuseness. “Delaval, of
course; what else? It’s pronounced ‘Della-val,’ but look at the
spelling! It’s de Laval, and that was the family name of Giles de Retz,
who was hanged and burned at Nantes in 1440 for wholesale murder!”</p>

<p>“O-oh!” Rosalie started up, but Forrester was bursting with his
discovery.</p>

<p>“And that picture — the one you said you didn’t like — that we saw at
his apartment today: I knew I’d seen that face somewhere before. It’s a
copy of the only portrait extant of Giles de Laval, the greatest
murderer of Mediaeval Europe and the original of the fairy tale of
Bluebeard we use to frighten children with today!”</p>

<p>He hurried to the study, ruffled through the telephone directory,
finally barked, “Give me Potomac 49325, please.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Carter? Forrester speaking,” he announced, when his connection
was made. “About the Podkin insurance policy payable to Doctor Delaval;
withhold payment — absolutely refuse any compromise settlement, even —
till you’ve heard from me.”</p>

<p>“Take it in low, Professor,” Carter replied with a chuckle. “Don’t you
go advising ducks to swim or cats to eat liver. I wouldn’t pay that
bimbo a counterfeit Turkish piaster till I know why he was Johnny-
on-the-spot when two perfectly good risks kicked the bucket.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, if you can wait till tomorrow afternoon!” Forrester
promised. “I’ve got some researches to make, but I think I’ve caught the
scent of the most villainous plot I’ve ever encountered.”</p>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="confound-the-wicked-one">Confound the Wicked One</h3>

<p>Professor Forrester had no classes the following morning, but he found
plenty to occupy his time. When Cassidy, the janitor of the Science
Building, arrived to begin his daily round of duties he found Forrester
hard at work with scalpel, tweezers, microscope and a bewildering array
of apparatus in the biological laboratory, and a little later Wilson,
the assistant librarian, was kept busy supplying a number of obscure
works on zoology and toxicology in response to the Professor’s urgent
calls.</p>

<p>At half-past one, fifteen minutes later than his usual time, the
Professor came home to luncheon, and did full justice to the broiled
Irish bacon, Sally Lunn and tea which Amaryllis placed before him.</p>

<p>“Rosalie, my dear,” he remarked, as he filled his pipe for his
after-luncheon smoke, “I think we’re going to have a very pleasant time.
Yes — an eminently enjoyable occasion.”</p>

<p>“Hou!” the girl laughed softly, lapsing into her quaint patois of mixed
oriental and occidental speech. “Is my master about to confound the
wicked one?”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” he assured her, puffing with lazy enjoyment at the
use-blackened briar. “Quite so, my dear; the wicked one is about to be
most confoundedly confounded, I think.”</p>

<p>“Mistu Cyarter wants ter speak ter yuh, suh,” Amaryllis informed him.
“He says hit’s mos’ impo’tant. Yessuh.”</p>

<p>“Hold everything, Professor,” Tom Carter’s cheerful voice announced as
Forrester picked up the ’phone. “Delaval wants a conference with me at
his house at three this afternoon, and I’d like to have a big armful of
alibis to hand him when he asks for a showdown.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” Forrester returned. “Meet me at the corner of Sixteenth and
Q Streets at ten minutes of three.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there, sir, if they have to carry me there on a stretcher!”</p>

<p>“Er, Carter,” the Professor suggested tentatively, “perhaps you’d better
have a policeman within call; we might — ”</p>

<p>“Fear not; I’ve got a commission as a special officer — for convenience
in my investigation work, you know. Yes, sir, regular policeman, that’s
me; wear a trick badge on my galluses and pack a gun, n’ everything.
I’ll add a pair of handcuffs to the ordnance equipment, if you say.”</p>

<p>“This thing may be more serious than you realize,” Forrester warned. “I
think you’ll do well to have your pistol with you.”</p>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="professor-podkins-death-certificate">Professor Podkin’s Death Certificate</h3>

<p>“Good evening,” Carter greeted his host as the colored maid showed him,
the Professor and Rosalie into Delaval’s sumptuous living room. “This is
Professor Forrester of the School of Anthropology at Benjamin Franklin
University, an old friend of Professor Podkin’s and mine; and this is
Miss Osterhaut. I brought ’em along this afternoon to give me moral
support and all that, you know.”</p>

<p>Doctor Delaval nodded frigidly to the Professor in acknowledgment of the
introduction, but did not trouble to rise from his chair. Rosalie he
ignored completely. “I fail to see why you require moral support from
strangers in a plain business transaction,” he replied coldly. “Your
company owes me money and has refused to pay it up to date. I now demand
that you fulfill your obligations.” As he spoke he pulled out a drawer
of the small desk at which he sat and produced a packet of papers.</p>

<p>Forrester and Rosalie glanced uncomfortably about the room, for their
host made no offer of seats. Finally the Professor sank into the nearest
chair, and Rosalie glided across the room with the lithe grace acquired
in ears of intensive study of oriental dancing, and seated herself near
the window, being careful to draw both feet up from the floor and tuck
them securely under her.</p>

<p>The Professor glanced at the picture above the fireplace, then at the
man beside the desk. The resemblance between the painted features and
the cold, pale countenance of his host was remarkable. Like the picture,
Delaval possessed a wealth of light-brown hair and a curling mustache of
the same shade, and his strong, rather prominent chin was adorned with a
close-cropped Van Dyke beard of intense black, a feature to single him
out in any crowd, no matter how large. His eyes were blue and cold as
the agate eyes of an image, and the lips which showed between his light
mustache and dark beard were well-formed and vivid red, but thin, and
habitually set in a sort of sneering smile as though he regarded his
fellows in general with a kind of pitying contempt.</p>

<p>Trained to note physical characteristics in Bushmen or Esquimaux,
Thibetans or fellaheen, when neither camera nor notebook were available
for memorandum, and memory must be relied on, Forrester was studying his
subject with the intentness of a professional anthropologist when his
scrutiny was broken by the sound of the other’s voice.</p>

<p>“I have here the copy of Professor Podkin’s death certificate,” he was
saying, “and it indicates he died of acute indigestion. Here — ” he held
out a second paper — “is the receipt for the last premium on the policy
of insurance on his life held by me, and here — ” he placed a third
document on the desk beside the others — “is the policy itself. My case
is complete. The contingency upon which you agreed to pay me $50,000 has
occurred, namely, Professor Podkin’s death, and I demand my money, sir.
There is nothing more to be said in the matter. That is all.”</p>

<p>Forrester crossed his thin knees and laid his long, slender fingers
together, tip-to-tip, gazing studiously at the fire behind the bright
brass fender. “Not quite all,” he objected mildly. “There are one or two
little matters to be gone into, I think.”</p>

<p>“Ah? Indeed?” Delaval returned sneeringly, his thin lips curling back
from his gleaming teeth in open contempt of this bookish little man who
dared question his statement. “Perhaps yon can shed some light on the
mystery which seems to be puzzling our young friend here?” He cast a
disdainful glance at Carter.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” Forrester agreed, his gaze still upon the fire. “Carter,” he
turned his head slightly toward the younger man, without raising his
eyes, and his voice assumed the thin, metallic tone he used only in
lecture hall, “do you happen to know what wourali is?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” the other returned wonderingly. Delaval leaned a little
farther forward, and his sardonic smile lost some of its bitter mirth,
becoming more of a grin.</p>

<p>“I thought you did not,” Forrester replied almost wearily. “Contrary to
general misconception, the Amazonian Indians do not poison their arrows
with snake venom or animal toxins; they employ a black resinoid extract
from the bark of Stryclinos toxifera, an indigenous shrub, and anoint
their arrowheads with it. They call it wourali, but chemists know it as
curare. When taken internally the concoction has little or no effect,
but when injected intravenously, as on the tip of an arrow, for
instance, it paralyzes the motor nerves and produces death by paralysis
of respiration. Its active principle is curarinc, the formula of which
is C<sub>19</sub>H<sub>26</sub>ON<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>“Now pay particular attention to this: Strychnine, our commercial drug,
is obtained from the plant Stryclunos ignatia, which is closely allied
to that from which wourali is made. As you are doubtless aware,
strychnine, when taken internally, acts as a powerful neurotic
stimulant, and produces death by paralysis of the respiratory system, if
the dose be large enough. Curiously enough, its formula is strikingly
similar to that of curarine, being
C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>22</sub>0<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>. Not identical
formula, of course, but similar; very similar. As you probably do not
know, an injection of a quarter-grain of strychnine into the arm, for
instance, will result in convulsions and death within a comparatively
short time, twenty minutes or so, a somewhat quicker death than the same
amount taken internally would produce.”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the room was tense, electric, like the dead-calm
before a cyclone, or the dreadful instant in the death chamber before
the executioner sets free the current that hurls the condemned into
eternity.</p>

<p>Carter sat forward in his chair, grasping its arms till his knuckles
showed white against the skin. Rosalie’s topaz eyes were dilated as
though she saw some indescribably horrible thing taking shape before
her, and once or twice she moistened her lips with the tip of her
tongue; her soft breathing could be heard across the chamber as she
leaned forward to catch every word. Delaval’s black beard seemed to
bristle on his chin and give off blue lights like a living thing, his
lips were so contracted that they showed pale and bloodless against his
teeth, and his face had gone almost corpse-gray. Only Professor
Forrester, still studying the fire, his finger tip to tip, seemed
unaware of the dramatic tension.</p>

<p>“We need not go into an extended discussion of this reptilia,” he droned
on in his singsong classroom voice, “but it will be interesting to note
that the bites of certain snakes cause symptoms almost exactly like
those of poisoning by curare. The Indian cobra, for instance, causes
death in a short time by paralyzing the respiratory centers of the
nervous system, and so does the bite of the king cobra. These snakes
belong to the family of elapidte, which includes the death adder and
tiger snake of Australia and the coral snakes of both North and South
America.</p>

<p>“The South American coral snake — <em>elaps fulvius</em>, you know — carries
the deadliest poison of all his tribe, even the cobras being
comparatively harmless beside him, though he is the smallest member of
his family. Fortunately, however, he is provided with such short fangs
that ordinary clothing will usually prevent his piercing the skin and
injecting his mortal venom into the blood. However, his fangs are
sufficiently long to penetrate an ordinary linen shirt, perhaps to cut
through several thicknesses of such thin fabric.</p>

<p>“Now, Professor Podkin was found by his wife in a sort of convulsion
just before he died, and when she called to him he seemed to become
worse. So would a person suffering from strychnine poisoning — or the
bite of one of these related snakes whose venom sets up symptoms
resembling those of curarine poisoning. If, by any odd chance, Podkin
had been bitten by, let us say, a South American coral snake, an
injection of strychnine would not only not have helped him, it would
have hastened his death from the venom. But of course — ” he raised his
eyes for the first time and blinked benevolently at his hearers through
the lenses of his pince-nez — “of course, it’s out of the question that
such a snake could have bitten Professor Podkin. There should not be any
such reptiles in this part of the world, you know.</p>

<p>“Now, as Dr. Delaval has pointed out, he happened to be calling at the
Podkins’ just as the poor fellow was seized with indigestion, and,
having his medicine kit handy, he gave him an injection of strychnine.
That was the best thing he could have done — for indigestion. He did the
same thing for Mrs. Robertson some time before, too, I am informed.</p>

<p>“But in Professor Podkin’s case the doctor was evidently nervous. The
shock of seeing his friend and co-worker so ill made him take
unnecessary trouble, for, instead of injecting his strychnine in
Professor Podkin’s right arm, which was nearest to him, he walked
completely around the couch and injected the left arm, which was nearest
to the open window by which Podkin had been lying asleep.</p>

<p>“In order to administer the dose he found it necessary to roll back
Podkin’s sleeve, of course, and on that sleeve was later found a tiny
spot of blood. This could not have come from the wound made by the
hypodermic needle, because the sleeve was not rolled down again until
the undertaker’s assistants came for Podkin’s body.</p>

<p>“Yesterday afternoon Rosalie and I called on Doctor Delaval, to offer
our condolences at the loss of his friend; but unfortunately the doctor
was out. I’m a clumsy sort of individual, and in the course of my
blundering about, I chanced to knock over a glass specimen-case, and
almost died as a consequence, for a half-grown coral snake happened to
be in that case, and very nearly bit me. Thanks to Rosalie’s prompt
action, the beast was killed; and as I was sure Doctor Delaval would
have no use for a dead snake about the house, I removed the carcass.</p>

<p>“This morning, in the biological laboratory — just as a matter of
curiosity — I dissected the reptile’s head, and found that one of his
poison fangs had been removed. You see, if he had bitten anyone, he
could have made only one wound with his remaining fang, and, while that
fang was quite long enough to pierce a shirt-sleeve — such as Professor
Podkin’s, for example — it was so small in diameter that an ordinarily
large hypodermic needle, inserted in the exact spot where the fang had
penetrated the skin, would obliterate all traces of snakebite.</p>

<p>“By the way, Doctor Delaval, what size needle did you use on Professor
Podkin?”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“You devil! You uncanny, merciless little devil!” Doctor Delaval had
risen from his chair and stood staring in a sort of horrified
fascination at Professor Forrester. His derisive smile was gone, and in
its place had come such a look of animal ferocity as the Professor had
never seen on human face. He ground his teeth like a wild beast gnashing
its fangs before springing on its prey, and his cold blue eyes blazed in
his death-pale face with a demoniacal phosphorescence.</p>

<p>“Damn you!” he almost shrieked, “You’ve guessed it! Yes, I did it. I
killed Podkin — the little fat swine! — and I killed the Robertson
woman, too. I put my pretty little pet through the open windows beside
which they both slept, holding it in a hand encased in a wire-cloth
glove, and teased it into biting them. Then I hurried away, and came to
their houses within the next fifteen minutes, knowing they would be
breathing their last by then, and would not be able to tell anyone what
ailed them, for they — poor miserable fools! — didn’t know, themselves.
I injected the strychnine in their arms, both to hasten the effect of
the snake poison and to destroy the traces of the fang’s marks, for I
knew no idiotic doctor in this city of fools would ever attribute their
deaths to anything so improbable as snake-bite.</p>

<p>“I collected for the Robertson death — ” he glared defiantly at Carter —
“and I should have collected for old fat Podkin’s death, too, if it had
not been for you, you meddling little busybody!” He turned his
infuriated glare on Forrester.</p>

<p>“But don’t think you’ll ever hail me into court for murder, you
short-sighted little school teacher!”</p>

<p>With a sweeping movement he yanked out the desk drawer, seized something
inside and brandished it above his head. It was a gray metal object,
about the size and shape of a large lemon, and both Forrester and Carter
breathed faster at sight of it. As Captain Forrester, the Professor had
seen too many of those things while serving with the Ordnance Department
during the World War to be mistaken, and Carter had dodged more than one
on the contested fields of Picardy and Flanders. It was a Lewis bomb, a
hand-grenade, not much larger than a child’s fist, but capable of
crumpling the room to a mass of wreckage if hurled against wall or
floor.</p>

<p>“You’ll not take me, I tell you!” Delaval screamed again. “See there?”
he pointed his free hand at the portrait above the mantelshelf.</p>

<p>“Do you know who that is? Giles de Laval, Lord of Retz and Maréchal of
France — Bluebeard! He was my ancestor, and I am his reincarnation; but
I have bettered his work. He killed for pleasure only, while I have made
my victims support me in the state to which one of my noble blood is
entitled. Ha! You think that you — you miserable, slow-minded Yankees —
can take me, Giles de Laval the Second, to prison? Not one of us leaves
this room alive!”</p>

<p>The swishing rustle of silk against silk, so soft it was scarcely
audible, even in the deathly stillness following Delaval’s wild
outburst, came from the chair in which Rosalie crouched. Then:</p>

<p>“Uh!” the exclamation was half cry, half grunt, as Delaval stumbled half
a step forward, twisted sharply to the left and let the bomb fall from
his unnerved fingers. The thing dropped harmlessly to the soft cushion
of the thick Chinese rug at his feet, but neither Forrester nor Carter
took note of it.</p>

<p>Lithe and graceful as a young tigress springing on her prey — and as
savagely — Rosalie hurled herself from her chair with a long, vaulting
leap and landed squarely on Delaval’s back a split-second after the
metal-tipped French heel of her little shoe, flung with the unerring
accuracy of one trained to cast throwing-knives with deadly effect, had
caught him behind the ear, knocking him half-unconscious.</p>

<p>Below the hem of her modishly short black satin afternoon gown one of
the girl’s extremities was clad in peach-bloom gossamer silk and a pump
of gleaming patent leather, the other showed lily-pale against the red
field of the rug, and, stretched between her slender hands, she held the
stocking she had ripped off while cowering in her chair.</p>

<p>With a quick, dexterous movement she looped the silken tube into a
flying noose, dropped its coil about Delaval’s neck and drew the ends
together, crossing them and straining with all her lithe young strength
at the knot thus made, while her slender fingers knotted into fists and
her knuckles kneaded at his spine at the base of the skull.</p>

<p>The man’s neck muscles stood out like cords, and the tendons showed like
lines of white against the skin of his hands as he strove futilely to
break the pitiless silken thing that choked the breath from his lungs.
His mouth opened spasmodically, the tongue protruding between lips which
already began to take on a bluish tinge, while the blood seemed bursting
from his face and his deep-sunk eyes started forward horribly, as though
pushed from behind.</p>

<p>“Wah, spawn of the sewer,” the girl hissed in a voice as venomous as the
hiss of a serpent. Lapsing into Hindustani in her excitement, “wallah,
unclean descendant of thrice-filthy ancestors, would you threaten the
life of Forrester Sahib? Worm, snake’s-brother,
consorter-with-the-crawling-things-of-the-earth, darest thou lift thy
obscene hand against my lord? By the Seven Holy Ones, I shall teach thee
to kiss the dust before his feet!”</p>

<p>Half strangled, wholly bewildered, all the fight choked and frightened
from him, the wretched man toppled to the floor, and, like a terrier
worrying a rat, the girl was on top of him, thrusting her bared knee
between his shoulder-blades, pulling his head upward, releasing it to
hang against the floor, then dragging it upward again with relentless,
neck-breaking jerks.</p>

<p>“Rosalie!” Forrester commanded sharply. “Stop it; you’re killing him!”</p>

<p>“Of course,” she answered pantingly, driving her victim’s face downward
into the rug’s thick nap, then snapping his neck upward with a short,
savage tug. “Of course, I shall slay him; did he not imperil my master’s
life?”</p>

<p>“That will do,” the Professor replied, taking her hands in his and
forcing her to drop the stocking. “Let him up, he –”</p>

<p>“He’s all wet!” Mr. Carter supplied, as he flung his hundred and
ninety-two pounds of bone and muscle upon the prostrate Delaval, drew
his hands sharply together and snapped steel wristlets on them. “I took
your advice. Professor, and came prepared with the harness,” he
explained, dragging his manacled captive to his feet. “Come on, you,” he
seized Delaval’s collar and lifted him from the chair into which he had
flung him as easily as if he had been a child. Come on to the police.
You’ve gypped the National Life Insurance Company for the last time.”</p>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="the-token-of-her-masters-favor">The Token Of Her Master’s Favor</h3>

<p>Professor Forrester looked almost diffidently at the serene young woman
seated in the taxicab beside him. She was still only partially clothed,
or she steadfastly refused to resume the stocking with which she had
nearly put Delaval to death.</p>

<p>“It is not fitting that a maiden wear that which had encircled the neck
of a toad,” she informed the Professor when he suggested the
desirability of her attiring herself conventionally before starting for
home, and neither commands nor entreaties availed to swerve her from her
decision. The only concession she made was to put on the pump with which
she had floored her adversary before garroting him.</p>

<p>“Why do you wear that absurd thing?” the Professor demanded, indicating
the golden circlet about her bare ankle.</p>

<p>Rosalie raised her stockingless foot and surveyed the slave bracelet
about her slim ankle with a look of complacency. “Do you remember where
you first met me, my lord?” she answered irrelevantly. “I was not known
as Rosalie Osterhaut in the house of Chandri Roi, but as Mumtaz Banjjan,
the Lady Moonflower, and sometimes only as Banjjan, the slave-girl. Is
it not so?”</p>

<p>“Umpf,” Forrester returned uncomfortably. He exceedingly disliked any
reference to his ward’s experience as an inmate of the zenana, but, in
spite of his express commands, she occasionally reverted to the subject.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she continued, turning her foot first one way, then another, so
that the setting sun’s rays played brilliantly on the little golden
links which lay against her white flesh. “Yes, I was a slave, a
barefooted slave with bangles on my ankles, then, and Forrester Sahib
rescued me from a fate far worse than death by torture. On that night I
put your foot upon my neck and made public acknowledgment that I was
yours by right of conquest and by my own gift, and I wear this little
fetter to remind me of my promise.”</p>

<p>“But hang it all!” Forrester retorted irritably, “you know perfectly
well there’s no such thing as slavery in this country, and I wouldn’t
own slaves if it were allowed. You’d better take that thing off.”</p>

<p>The girl bowed her golden head submissively. “Forrester Sahib is my lord
and I am his slave,” she announced. “If he should desire to beat me I
would welcome his blows as the bride thirsts for her bridegroom’s
kisses; but while Mumtaz Banjjan lives she will not take from off her
ankle the symbol of the servitude she would not exchange for an empress’
throne. Rather would she kiss the dust of Forrester Sahib’s footprints
than the lips of any other man upon the earth.”</p>

<p>The Professor stuffed his pipe and struck a match. “You’re a quaint
little baggage, Rosalie — but you’ve risked your life for mine twice in
the last twenty-four hours. Would you like a new fur coat?”</p>

<p>Once more Rosalie inclined her head as though in utter self-abasement;
but something very like a smile of satisfaction hovered on her pink lips
as she returned in a low voice:</p>

<p>“Forrester Sahib is the lord of Mumtaz Banjjan’s life and the breath of
her mouth and the blood of her heart. She has no thought nor wish but
such as her lord permits; but if it pleases her master to buy his slave
a coat — a long coat of otter skin with collar and cuffs of mink, if he
pleases — can the slave do aught but humbly accept the token of her
master’s favor?”</p>
