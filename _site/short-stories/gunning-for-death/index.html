<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="a-sniveling-quitter">A Sniveling Quitter</h3>

<p>Bars in the Nation’s Capital are mostly garish, red-leather-and-chrome affairs that do no more than add to the restless, tense loneliness that forever grips most of the populace. There are no neighborhood saloons, and there is no neighborliness. You have to be seated to be served a drink even of plebian beer. You can’t move about, but only stay at your tiny table, or cramped booth, while a who-the-hell-cares type of waitress infrequently appears discourteously to serve you another of whatever-it-is you’re drinking. A guy, looking for camaraderie, the good-fellowship that goes with imbibing, is better off taking a train to Baltimore.</p>

<p>I used to go to the Maryland metropolis to do my friendly drinking, but now I didn’t want any of that. I just wanted to be alone, to crawl into my dismal shell and get stinko. A Washington bar is just suited for that—that is, if you get one where the barkeep or the proprietor will continue to serve you. The law says you get no service if the server considers you’ve already had enough, or when he so considers. But it’s hard to tell if a man’s drunk when he’s sitting down; anyway, most places are too money-conscious to refuse you a drink no matter what your condition. I didn’t ever want to stop, unless I fell over.</p>

<p>But then this vision, this girl, slid into the booth, facing me, where I was proceeding to drown my woes. “It is Dan Wilkins, isn’t it?” she asked.</p>

<p>I nodded, trying to focus my eyes in the afternoon dimness of the place, trying to get into line the cherry-brown hair, the pert face beneath it, the firmness where her tight-fitting jacket only suggested a plunge. Light brown eyes looked into mine and helped me get the picture.</p>

<p>“Have a drink?” I queried. I held up a hand and the waitress appeared. “The same for me,” I said, which meant a double rye with water to wash it down.</p>

<p>“Planter’s punch,” the vision said.</p>

<p>“So?” I said, my head feeling light “So what do you see?”</p>

<p>Her eyes had raked me over and over and the rye in me rebelled at the inspection.</p>

<p>“A sniveling quitter,” she replied.</p>

<p>“What,” I growled, “business is it of yours? A great guy, my best pal, murdered, and me fired from my job because of it! Kicked out on my can! So I got a right to get plastered.”</p>

<p>The words rolled thickly off my tongue.</p>

<p>“A man would fight back.”</p>

<p>The way the dame accented the word, the disgust in her voice, roiled me and took the edge from my insobriety. Bitterness and a touch of honest shame—the girl was right— had a slightly sobering effect. A maddening one, too, so I grunted, “Who the hell are you, sister, and how did you find me? And what do you want?”</p>

<p>“I found you,” her brown eyes flashed, “by calling at your apartment-house and being told you were probably at the nearest cafe. I looked in on two others before I got to this one. The name is Dee Morgan and I want…”</p>

<p>“What?” I jumped at the name, quite sober now.</p>

<p>“Johnny’s sister,” she said, softly gravely.</p>

<p>“Johnny’s sister,” I gulped. “I knew he had one, in school somewhere, but I didn’t…”</p>

<p>“Cedar Crest College for Women,” she said. “I left the school yesterday to come here; I won’t go back until I find Johnny’s murderer. I thought you would want to help.” Her lovely face twisted into lines of pain, determination, vengeance.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The waitress served the drinks and I gulped mine needing it to cushion the shock. “Sure,” I said, my voice low, serious, “I’d like to find him, too. I’d also like to fly like a bird, or maybe break the bank at Jim’s place over in St. George’s County. But I can’t even get in the joint. Or sprout wings,” I added.</p>

<p>Dee Morgan seemed not to hear me. “I need help.”</p>

<p>“I know,” I said. “But, honey, Johnny’s murder was just one more in a long list of murders. You could even add to the list the thousands of our boys killed by the Chinese Reds in Korea, killed with weapons made in U.S.A. The best brains in the law enforcement agencies of every country in the free world can’t put a finger on the man, or men responsible. What can you—or the two of us—do?”</p>

<p>“Johnny was my brother,” she said, simply, as though that was the only answer.</p>

<p>“And my best friend,” I said. “I worked with him, drank with him. I was at his side the night he got it, and,” my voice took on a bitter tone, “I got kicked out of the Department because my pig-headed supervisor held me responsible for Johnny’s death. How do you think I feel, Dee Morgan?”</p>

<p>Her brown eyes looked into my bleary, bloodshot blue ones. I felt something new, something strange, twist at my heart.</p>

<p>“Like my brother,” she spoke softly, “you were an investigator, an undercover agent. for the Munitions Division of the State Department. Your job was to collect information on arms smugglers, the kind of rottenness that makes millions in profit while the enemy kills our men with guns and ammunition of our own manufacture.” Dee’s eyes hardened; she sipped her drink.</p>

<p>“No lecture, please,” I said, “You’re not telling me anything new. And the profit is in billions, not just millions.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” she tossed her head and the cherry-brown hair whipped enchantingly back from her shoulders. “I can’t help myself sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Johnny felt the same way, honey,” I said. I reached out a hand and covered hers. It felt soft and warm beneath my touch and I knew then that here was a hand that I would always want to hold.</p>

<p>“Profit from guns, and blood,” her words had a harsh ring. “Did Johnny tell you anything before he…he died?” she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“Tell me anything? He didn’t take me into his confidence, if that’s what you mean. He didn’t have time to; I knew from his actions, his hints, the excitement in his manner, that he felt he had something on his return from Manila. But…”</p>

<p>Dee Morgan interrupted. “He did have something, Dan. He found something in Manila that proved to him there was a traitor, a leak of some kind, in your own Division—right here in Washington.”</p>

<p>“What?” I gasped, then, “How do you know?”</p>

<p>“He wrote me, Dan,” the girl said, and I liked the way she bad begun to use my name, liked the way it came from her full, luscious tips. “He always wrote me, in a special code we had between us. I think he did it mostly as a big brother trying to satisfy a kid sister’s appetite for adventure. I knew about you because he wrote me often about you, described you, and once he sent me a picture of the two of you together.”</p>

<p>“But about this—this leak in our own offices?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t have a name,” Dee said. “He only was certain the person existed. He was going to tell you his suspicions, and take them up with Paul Pleven…”</p>

<p>“Paul,” I said, slowly; “Johnny reported to him immediately he got in from Manila, was with him for several hours. Then Paul ordered us both to take the next plane to New York. Johnny hadn’t had time to unpack. That very night, down on the lower East Side—where we were supposed to rendezvous with a couple of stool pigeons—Johnny got it.</p>

<p>“All Johnny said to me up to then was that he had latched onto something big; he’d tell me about it when we got back here.”</p>

<p>“But he didn’t get back.”</p>

<p>“No,” I said. “And I got back to have Paul Pleven boot me out. Officially, so he said, I turned yellow; I let Johnny die. He twisted the report from the New York cops to make it look that way.”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Dee’s wonderful eyes bored into mine, “The way I see it, you should be dead, too. But you escaped; so the next best thing was to have you discredited. Then, even if you knew what Johnny had known you’d be laughed at; you’d be a discredited sorehead trying to even up for the loss of his job.”</p>

<p>“You mean that whoever this traitor is, he was on to Johnny—that the deal that sent us rushing off to New York was a trap?”</p>

<p>“I mean just that,” Dee’s brown eyes snapped. “He must have told your supervisor…”</p>

<p>“Pleven? But I don’t think he…”</p>

<p>She interrupted my interruption. “It doesn’t have to be Pleven; he could have passed Johnny’s report on up the line and whoever is guilty was in a position immediately to contact some of his racketeer pals, arrange this New York deal, and pass the assignment back through Pleven.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I admitted.</p>

<p>“Whoever it is,” Dee Morgan showed the steel that was in her, “That’s the man who murdered Johnny.” She turned her flaring gaze on me again. “Will you help me get him?”</p>

<p>“If this is true,” I said, “it’s big. Bigger than both of us. Bigger than just Johnny’s murder. Too big for just you and me. But I’m with you; where do we start?”</p>

<p>“With Pleven,” she said.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“You go back to your apartment,” she advised me, “and get yourself completely sober. Shower, eat, do whatever it is that offsets the whiskey. I’ll see you later this evening; I’m staying at the Smith-Plaza Hotel; I’ll call you from there.”</p>

<p>We left the bar together after I paid my check. I put her in a cab, then walked slowly, thoughtfully, to the building that housed my one-room-bath-and-kitchenette efficiency apartment.</p>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="suspects">Suspects</h3>

<p>I showered, letting the hot needle-point spray steam out the alcohol, then found myself pacing the floor of my one room, frowning out its windows on the darkness that was beginning to shadow the Washington sky. I watched the dusk as it lowered over the top of the Veterans Administration building, across the park from my apartment-house abode. “Damn,” I muttered, and, “Double damn!”</p>

<p>Then I made up my mind. I lifted my phone from its cradle and dialed a number. A moment later, I asked for a certain extension. “Joe,” I said finally.</p>

<p>Joe Amantia, sleek black-haired Joe who looks more like a ballroom dancer than an FBI agent, admitted he was at the other end of the wire. A long-time friend, Joe had worked on a number of the cases of munitions smugglers Johnny or I had turned up. We of the Munitions Division of the State Department, after all, had no arresting power; we were spies only, digging up the dirt for the enforcement agencies. “Dan Wilkins, Joe,” I said.</p>

<p>He began to tell me what a dirty deal I got from the Division, but I cut him short. I told him about Dee Morgan and what she had told me.</p>

<p>“I think there’s plenty to it, Joe,” I said. “It adds up. Johnny’s excitement; the funny way he was ordered out on that New York caper practically before he could get his breath. Usually, when an investigator came in from a trip like Johnny’d just made to Manila, he gets a rest, some time off. Routine. It’s only struck me now how queer it was to shoot him back out; and me along with him. And there were plenty others who could have handled the assignment of collecting whatever the stoolies had to offer.”</p>

<p>Amantia got it. “Yes,” he said, “if such it was to have been.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” I returned, “Hell, Joey, the Division’s got a couple undercover men regularly stationed in New York. The more I think about it the more I’m convinced it was a murder trap for Johnny, and for yours truly.”</p>

<p>At last the Federal man advised, “I know I can’t tell you to stay out of it, Dan. Johnny was your best friend, and now you’ve got your feet wet. You’ve got this sister on you, too. But play it easy-like; you’re gunning for death, kid.”</p>

<p>“There was always the chance of that, Joe,” I said “All the time I was with the Division.”</p>

<p>“But this is different, Dan. You were one of Uncle Whiskers’ boys before, and not such an easy mark. You haven’t got Uncle officially on your side now, you know. And if this Mr. X, whoever it may be, suspects…you’re less a threat to him dead than alive, even with a cloud over you. The girl, too, Dan.”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>I hung up, in a moment, with some of the tension in me eased, knowing that the FBI would start digging, start getting some wheels in motion, even if Joe had to begin unofficially. Dee and I were no longer alone.</p>

<p>Then the telephone bell jangled, and it was Dee Morgan. “Feeling better?” she asked, and I affirmed that I was. Much better; but I did not tell her why. Let Joe Amantia remain in the background, at least for a while; he would be around when we needed him. And I had a feeling that we would need him.</p>

<p>“Would you like to take me to dinner?” she asked.</p>

<p>Truthfully, I replied that I’d enjoy taking her to dinner under any circumstances.</p>

<p>Her voice over the wire rasped like rosin rubbed on glass. “This is business, Mr. Wilkins.”</p>

<p>“Business it is, then,” I said, irritated; “but you did call me Dan this afternoon.</p>

<p>She laughed, then, throatily, and I thought how much lovelier her face must be with a smile upon it.</p>

<p>“All right, Dan,” she said, “It’s just that…oh, I don’t know! I’m on edge. It’s my brother’s murderer I want, not someone to…”</p>

<p>“To tell you how wonderful you are?” I asked, brashly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wilkins!” The rasp was back again.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” I said, although I wasn’t. “I’ll call for you at the hotel in half an hour.”</p>

<p>When I hailed a cab to transport me to the Smith-Plaza, I suddenly remembered the glimpse I’d had of Dee’s gorgeous gams as I’d ushered her into a hack after we’d quitted the bar. It was like seeing them again and this time; while the lovely sight had registered before my mind had been too coonfused to let her legs excite me.</p>

<p>She was waiting for me in the hotel lobby, trim, neat, her tailored green suit setting off a figure that whistled at itself. I looked at her legs now, stared. And Dee, catching my gaze, had the grace to blush and say, as she placed a hand on arm, “Please. Dan.”</p>

<p>We went to a capital city rant, famous for its barbecued spare-ribs. Over the succulent morsels and between sips of beer, she said, “Our best plan is to work on Pleven. If he’s the guilty one, we’ll force him to crack, somehow. If he’s not; well, we’ll have cleared him and we’ll know we’ve got to go on.’’</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t Paul be too obvious a suspect?” I asked.</p>

<p>The light brown eyes probed mine “You’re not wearing your thinking-cap tonight, are you?” There was a hint of a grin tugging at the corners of her lips.</p>

<p>I wasn’t. I was only thinking of her—and a guy can dream, can’t he? I shrugged. “He was our superior; he issued the ordering us into…If he’s the rat, the Mr. X, the unknown quantity…well, it seems too easy, too certain.”</p>

<p>She spelled it out for me. “Only to us, Dan. Except for what Johnny discovered, there’s no trail to Paul Pleven, and even Johnny didn’t have his name. And whatever Johnny did know…” The misery, and the hate, darkened her eyes. “And Pleven, if he’s Mister X, is sure Johnny passed no information on to you. If he had, you’d have acted by this time. If you had suspicions of your well, you know where you stand.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>“As for me, Johnny’s file in the Department would inform Mister X of my existence, not I doubt if he’d ever dream that Johnny would pass on any suspicions to his college-girl sister.”</p>

<p>“You are so right,” I chided.</p>

<p>Her fingers, greasy with the handling of the ribs without benefit of knife and fork, clenched into fists.</p>

<p>She could be no more than in her early twenties, yet her face seemed old beyond its years as her emotions betrayed her. “Maybe I should go right to Pleven and accuse him…”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>I reached across the booth we shared and patted her arm. Some of the frantic, tense feeling within her communicated itself to me but I held it in check. “You’ll do nothing so rash, honey, unless you want to wind up in the family plot with Johnny. I’ve seen these racketeers at work; it isn’t pleasant. And it would be oh, so easy to arrange a convenient ‘suicide’ of the grieving sister.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to do something.”</p>

<p>I could have told her that I’d contacted Federal Agent Amantia, but all I said was, “It’s your party.”</p>

<p>Dee wiped her fingers on her napkin, wiped the corners of her mouth, then busied herself with the application of a fresh coat of lipstick to the ripe lips that, I thought, needed no adornment. The lines of her face softened and she looked like a sweet kid out on a happy date. My heart trip-hammered as my eyes feasted upon her. At last, she spoke. “Could we go to the Diplomats’ Club?”</p>

<p>I almost jumped from my seat. “The Diplomats’ Club! Do you know what it is?”</p>

<p>She smiled. “Not exactly. Johnny sometimes mentioned in his letters that he went there, with you, with this Mr. Pleven, for a few drinks—especially after a long day’s work In the office, or when one of you came back to Washington from being out on a case.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t explain?”</p>

<p>“No, but, Dan,” her smile was lovely, “I’ve been to night clubs.”</p>

<p>“This is different, Dee,” I explained. “Washington hasn’t many of the garden variety of night club which, by local law, close weekday mornings by two o’clock, and by midnight on weekends. This has brought about the opening of so-called after-hours clubs. They operate under high-sounding names, but none of them are genuine clubs—just hangouts for nocturnal drinking. A member buys a bottle of liquor, takes it to the club and pays a terrific service charge to drink his own stuff. Some of the places offer entertainment, a jive band, a singer of risqué songs.”</p>

<p>“So,” Dee mouthed.</p>

<p>“Most of them are run by hoodlums, and most of them are patronized by the night-owl gamblers and racketeers who get away with murder in this city.”</p>

<p>“But you go to such places,” the girl interjected.</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” I agreed. “These places thrive on we suckers who work, or worked, late hours, burning the midnight oil until long after the legitimate places legally closed their bars. Tension-driven, a few drinks seems the answer. The excitement; the work; the worry; the confusion—all the things attendant upon this mixed-up time we live in, like the Far East situation today, makes more customers. As fast as the authorities crack down on one club, three others spring into existence.”</p>

<p>“Are you lecturing now?” Dee asked, slyly. “Or excusing yourself?”</p>

<p>“Neither,” I grinned. “But the Diplomats is that kind, a hangout of the criminal element, a breeder of crime. Actually, it’s run by an offshoot of a New York mob. It’s located in Foggy Bottom…”</p>

<p>“Foggy Bottom?” Dee interrupted.</p>

<p>“An old neighborhood term for the area in which the new State Department building is located. So the place was close by when we needed a drink, a spot of relaxation.”</p>

<p>“And Paul Pleven still goes there?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” I answered, “but it’s not the place for you. I wouldn’t…”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Dee frowned and under the creases of her forehead her eyes flashed. “Dan Wilkins, are you the man my brother wrote me about? The guy who’d risk his life on an assignment; the one who carried a torch for the good in the world; the fellow who would destroy these profiteers?” Her voice rose shrilly.</p>

<p>I shushed her, but she continued, voice lower but still intense, “Don’t you see? If this club is what you say it is, it must be where Pleven, or any other, has his contacts? It’s the place for us to start; I want to go there, now, more than ever.” Dee was quivering with the force of her emotion.</p>

<p>I sighed, resignedly. “All right. This is Friday, and if Paul works late, he’s sure to drop in for a few nips at his bottle. A lot of the Department people will be there, listening to the tinny band, drinking hard, because they won’t have to get up tomorrow. I’m not sure I’ll be welcomed, but…”</p>

<p>“Still got that self-pity,” Dee muttered.</p>

<p>That did it. “We’ll go,” I said, hiding my anger.</p>

<p>Her face turned radiant. “I knew I could count on you, Dan,” she said, “even though it takes a needle once in a while to get you moving.”</p>

<p>My anger melted. “We’ve time to waste,” I said, “How about a movie?”</p>

<p>In the theatre, I held her hand and forgot all else.</p>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="pleven">Pleven</h3>

<p>The guy inside the door to the Diplomats’ Club, a dingy, red-brick building hardly in keeping with its name, looked like the cinema version of a tough guy. He recognized me and nodded, reaching for the bottle I carried, one I’d purchased at a liquor store before the movie. He passed it over to another character from the same mold who sat at a desk behind a partition that also served as a checkroom. The guy at the desk grunted, “Wilkins, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>I nodded, and the character printed the name of a piece of gummed paper, which he pasted to the bottle. He handed the fifth back to me, by way of the doorman, and said, “Give it to the bartender,” as if I didn’t know. We had no coats to leave, so I ushered Dee along the hall and up the stairs that led to the club parlor. We stood for a moment in the doorway that led from the upper hall into the long, high-ceilinged room, a long bar running the length of one side, with the rest of the room except for a small bare portion just in front of the dais at the end opposite the doorway crammed with small tables, each with several chairs. The orchestra on the dais was blaring forth with the Tennessee Waltz.</p>

<p>There were a few customers at the bar, and a few couples at scattered tables, but none of the State Department crowd. I recognized a couple of numbers writers and the usual hangers-on. It was yet early. The waiters, sleek, olive-skinned, furtive-eyed, all eyed me as I marched Dee to a table. Their opinion of me did not matter; I had a lower one of them. When we were seated, one approached. “Didn’t expect you, Mr. Wilkins,” he said, his oily stare taking in Dee Morgan, mentally undressing her.</p>

<p>I handed him the rye. “With water on the side for me,” I said, “And yours?” I turned to my companion.</p>

<p>“Likewise,” the girl smiled.</p>

<p>The fellow left us. “I see what you meant,” Dee said.</p>

<p>My eyebrow went up, and she added, “The kind of characters here. He looks like he just came out from under a rock.”</p>

<p>“A little punk,” I said, “the slimy kind, a short-change artist.”</p>

<p>The waiter returned with our drinks and then moved his slippery way back to the bar to join his counterparts there.</p>

<p>Dee sipped at the rye, then poured it into her water glass. She let her eyes rove about the huge room, taking in the framed photographs of dignitaries of state, which adorned the walls on all sides.</p>

<p>“Blasphemy,” I grunted.</p>

<p>Her eyes flicked from the photos to me. She tossed her pretty head in affirmation. “I’m sure,” she said, “you’d never find a Jimmy Byrnes or an Acheson in this place, in the flesh.”</p>

<p>“But the Plevens,” I said.</p>

<p>“I hope,” Dee grimaced.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The place began to fill up. A motley crowd. A number of musicians and entertainers who worked the legitimate nightspots and could not partake of alcoholic beverages while on the job. Army, Air Force, Navy men in uniform, drinking with a ‘let’s live for today’ attitude, not knowing but what the next hour might find them headed for Korea, Germany, or some other abscess festering on the face of the good earth.</p>

<p>Heavily rouged and painted ladies of the night. Innocent young Government-girls, hysterically making the best of a night out with a man, an all too rare thing in a city overly populated with women.</p>

<p>There were a few of the late workers from the Department; those that noticed me looked on me darkly, then pointedly ignored me. The freeze hurt. At last Paul Pleven came in, alone.</p>

<p>“Our quarry has arrived,” I said to my companion.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>I nodded toward the bar where stood, a little apart from the rest, a tall man, very tall. With strong, bony face beneath a balding pate.</p>

<p>Dee’s eyes blackened and narrowed almost to slits. “Now what?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I want to meet him. We’ve got to get him on the hook, even if I have to resort to sex.” She had the grace to blush.</p>

<p>“He may chose to ignore me, as some others here have,” I said, the taste of it bitter in my mouth.</p>

<p>My former supervisor did just that. But only until the bourbon he’d been punishing took hold. Then he made his way to our table and stood over us; we’d pretended not to notice his approach. “You got your nerve, coming here,” he said to me.</p>

<p>I looked up then and for the first time noticed the glitter of his pale eyes. His mouth was kind of sneery and I felt that he wanted trouble.</p>

<p>“What’s a good-looking dame like you want with a yellow snake like this?” He turned to Dee.</p>

<p>I wanted to smash him on the spot. A knot hardened in my stomach. Dee recognized my feelings and only an almost imperceptible shake of her head kept me from boiling over. “Maybe you should lower your voice, Paul,” I said, evenly.</p>

<p>Dee smiled up at his sneering face. “Mr. Wilkins and I are friends, Mr. Whoever-you-are.”</p>

<p>Paul’s voice got louder, for the benefit of the other Department employees in the club, “Nice girls don’t make friends of a worm like Wilkins. He contaminates people; he lets his friends die.”</p>

<p>Only a superhuman effort kept me from rising from my chair and socking him. “Paul,” I said, spacing my words, “May I introduce you to Miss Dee Morgan, Johnny’s sister.”</p>

<p>An odd look crossed the man’s face. His thin lips tightened; he pulled up a chair and jackknifed into it. He seemed less drunk as he stared across the tiny table at Dee. A strange tension spread over us and chilled me. I glanced covertly at Pleven and saw a stranger, not a man I’d known and worked under for several years. There was something deadly, cobra-like, to this man, his pose, his eyes. Something evil seemed present, grim and foreboding. Then Paul laughed, loudly, and his long frame slumped back in his chair. The spell was broken.</p>

<p>“Johnny Morgan’s sister,” he said.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Paul led the conversation into channels of bright, meaningless chatter, mostly ignoring me, deftly but politely showing his distaste for me, but playing up to Dee. Smooth, I thought, smooth and very smart.</p>

<p>How smooth and clever was apparent as, feigning friendly interest in Dee Morgan’s school life, her plans for the future that would—sadly—be one without a loved but lamented brother, he drew from her the admission that Johnny had passed on to her a suspicion of intrigue within the Department’s Munitions Division.</p>

<p>Dee realized her mistake and tried to gloss over it. Pleven’s attitude did not change, outwardly, but I sensed him stiffen, felt the chill of evil again hover over us. I quickly downed a shot of rye. The drinks had been coming with fair regularity since Paul had joined us, the waiter always at elbow, very solicitous.</p>

<p>I glanced about the crowded, smoke-filled room, trying to allay my fear. I knew that if I looked at Dee my feelings would show; that my fear which was chiefly for her could not be hidden. My eye caught the gaze of a man at a table behind ours; he looked away, but not before I was aware of his interest in the action at our table.</p>

<p>He was a small, inconspicuous sort of guy, alone, toying with a drink from a half-pint bottle he kept on the table before him. I wondered for a moment, then dismissed him as some lonely clerk eagerly hoping for company in this city where crowds and companions seldom are the kind to dispel loneliness. I turned my attention back just as Pleven, his mouth sneering again on me, excluding me, got up to leave. He was telling Dee to be sure to call him on the morrow.</p>

<p>I watched, silent, as Paul made his way, less unsteady for all the liquor he had consumed, back to the bar. I thought he mouthed a word to a pair of plug-uglies, minor hoodlums, on stools at the near end of the bar; I thought the mugs looked at me, then. But I shrugged it off as a figment of apprehension as Dee spoke. “Take me back to the hotel, Dan.”</p>

<p>I paid my oversized check and we quitted the after-hours joint. Dee Morgan sat close to me in the taxi on the way to her hotel and I felt again a swift sensation of pleasure. “I’m afraid of that man, Dan,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Huh?” I came out of my reverie.</p>

<p>“He’s foul; there’s something about him…”</p>

<p>“So,” I commanded, “You stay, away from him, whatever it was about his seeing you tomorrow. If he’s our man, and if he thinks you know the score….well, honey, I’ve seen enough murders to know that no corpse is ever pretty.” I found her hand and squeezed it. “I don’t want you to become a corpse.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t accomplished anything yet; it must come from him. We need a little more connecting him with this.”</p>

<p>The hand was nestled pleasantly in mine. I pressured it again and thrilled to feel an answering pressure. “Honey,” I murmured, “I think the time has come to look for help. We can go to the FBI…”</p>

<p>“And have them laugh at us?” she interrupted.</p>

<p>I clammed up. I bade her goodnight after asking her to promise not to do anything silly the next day, this day, in fact, for it was early Saturday morning—almost time for dawn to creep grayly up and over the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial, the kind of things that stood for the way of life we must yet fight to protect.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>I walked home from the Smith-Plaza, feeling the cool air might help me think, find a way to move in what was yet, to me, a maze. I reached the grey-brown, uninspiring Veterans Administration building and crossed to the park opposite, toward my abode. Out of the darkness behind me I suddenly felt an arm encircle my neck. I tried to turn, to fight back, but the arm tightened and a second form came out of the dimness of the park to smash a fist into the side of my face. I must have been slugged a good many times until I lost consciousness, and after that, for it was a long time until I came to.</p>

<p>When I did, I found myself tied to a cot. I could feel caked blood on my face and there wasn’t a part of me that didn’t ache. My right eye was but a pinpoint in a puffed face; my left but little better. My lips were thick, sore, encrusted, too, with dried blood. I could taste the blood in my throat. My head pounded with pain and it hurt the more to try to discover where I was.</p>

<p>Faint light entered the room, bare except for where I lay tied and a chair opposite. I heard a train whistle and felt that I was being held in a room of one of the old, dilapidated buildings in the slum area of Southwest Washington, somewhere near where the trains moved along into Virginia and to the South. And I really was held; I tugged at the ropes that bound me and only succeeded in sending new waves of pain and nausea over my battered self. Whoever had tied me had meant me to stay tied. I strained and passed out again.</p>

<h6 class="btt"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h6>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="hes-got-her">He’s Got Her</h3>

<p>Somebody began to shake me. Rudely, for a bruised guy like me. Lights suddenly hurt my slits of eyes. I pushed against the ropes and felt them loosen. I looked up into the dark, handsome face of Joe Amantia.</p>

<p>“Joey,” I grunted, feebly.</p>

<p>He helped me to sit up and then I noticed the little fellow. It was the same unobtrusive guy I’d noted at the Diplomats’ Club, the one I’d passed off in my mind as a lonely clerk. My throbbing head began to put two and two together.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” said the FBI agent, “I put a tail on you within a few minutes after you telephoned me. I wanted to have someone on hand when you went barging in like a knight on a white horse. I didn’t want you to join Johnny Morgan, six feet under the sod.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” I tried to talk and the resulting mumble sounded silly, even to me.</p>

<p>My friend shook his head. “I know. But if I hadn’t taken the precaution, you’d be a dead duck now.”</p>

<p>“What happened?” The way I said it must have been the way the corny expression originated: Wha’ hoppen?</p>

<p>“A couple of hoods followed you from the Diplomats’ Club. Nichols here,” he indicated the little man who smiled at me, “was behind you, too. Too late to be of help in the beating you took, but not too late to get the license number of the car they used to haul you away. He rooted me out of bed and, well, here we are. It did take us a couple of hours to find the car, a stolen one, where it had been abandoned, and to make a thorough search of this area.”</p>

<p>“The thugs,” I managed to whisper.</p>

<p>“Took them without much trouble,” Amantia answered, airily. “And they’ll sing; we already know who put them onto you.”</p>

<p>My lips formed the word: Pleven.</p>

<p>The Fed continued, “You were to be held until it was convenient to get rid of you. Probably in a container of cement to be dumped into the Potomac.”</p>

<p>I shuddered.</p>

<p>“Dee?” I asked, “Miss Morgan?”</p>

<p>“There’s a man at the hotel,” Joe said. “Well, let’s get you out of here and get you some medical attention.”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>It even ached to sit in the soft rear seat of the FBI man’s car, but wonder and worry exceeded the ache. “You hop into this, Joe,” I asked, “just on the strength of my phone call?”</p>

<p>“No, Dan,” he answered, honestly, “not quite. Actually, we’ve been wary of Pleven for some time. Oh, his loyalty check passed muster; no taint of any Commie ties. But there were a number of little things in the reports that came in. Some of his associations with odd characters, mostly the five-and-ten-cent brand of hoodlum, the hopheads. And reports of his spending far more money than his position paid him; they added up to something.”</p>

<p>I grunted, my bruised lips churning on an oath.</p>

<p>“We want him now,” added Joe, “and we want the man, or men, above him.” Joe’s words were cold, nasty. “We want any lead to that top guy.”</p>

<p>“Some day,” I said, “We’ll turn him up. The brains of the whole stinking international gang.” The rest of my words were unprintable.</p>

<p>We drove on in silence, neither of us needing to express the grim hatred we felt. Nichols, still resembling an inoffensive clerk, sat quietly beside Joe in the front of the car. We drove to my home and the boys assisted me to my room. “I’ll call a doctor,” Amantia said.</p>

<p>I looked at my electric alarm clock. Its hands showed three o’clock in the afternoon. “Let me call Dee first,” I said.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>I dialed the Smith-Plaza number, then asked the hotel operator Dee’s room. I listened to the ring, a queasiness growing in my guts. At last the operator advised that that room did not answer. Angrily I barked to be connected with the desk clerk. I told him who I was and asked if Miss Morgan had gone out.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the clerk answered, “and she left a message for you, Mr. Wilkins. Said if you called, to tell you she went to see the supervisor; that she would call you later.”</p>

<p>I groaned and not with the pain of my hurts. “Joe,” I cried, “Paul’s got her! He’ll kill her! He’s wise! That’s why he put those thugs on me. Dee let it slip last night that Johnny’d got some word to her.”</p>

<p>Amantia’s dark face wore a deep frown. “She slipped by our man, somehow.” To me, he added, “Take it easy, Dan; we’ll get to him. He thinks he’s safe, with you out of the way. He doesn’t know we’ve got his hired stooges and have turned you loose. He’s got only the girl to worry about and I doubt if he does away with her…yet. Smart killers don’t operate in daylight, Dan; they like the cover of night.”</p>

<p>Joe’s words had some of the desired effect. I knew Pleven would never suspect that I’d gone to the FBI with the suspicions Dee had brought. He’d seen to it that I was a discredited, yellow bum; how would I dare to go to the authorities? And, as far as he knew, his torpedoes had me tied up, to be disposed of later. But I still burned for action, burned with a bitter desire that blotted out my bodily pain. If Pleven harmed a hair of Dee Morgan’s head, I’d rend him limb from limb.</p>

<p>“Let’s get going!” I shouted.</p>

<p>Joe shrugged. “You should be in bed, under a physician’s care, but I’ve worked enough with you to know better. Come on; we’ve got Pleven’s address.”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Siren screaming, Joe pushed the car swiftly through Washington traffic and out Massachusetts Avenue to grind to a halt before an imposing apartment-house building.</p>

<p>“Elite son,” I grunted through my puffed lips as Joe, Nichols and self piled from the car and moved into the foyer of the building. A slender lily-like desk clerk rose languidly at our approach. “Yes, gentleman,” his girlish voice sounded.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pleven in?” asked Amantia, “Paul Pleven?”</p>

<p>“But no,” the dainty fellow answered, “He’s gone out, perhaps half an hour ago. Left in his car.”</p>

<p>“Alone?” I butted in.</p>

<p>The pretty boy turned up his nose at me, at my battered face and ripped, dirty suit. Or perhaps he turned up his nose in disdain because, as he intoned, “With a woman.”</p>

<p>“A woman?” This was the Fed’s question.</p>

<p>“She called for him. He down and joined her and they off.”</p>

<p>I groaned. “He’s got her, Joe!”</p>

<p>Nichols spoke for the first.</p>

<p>“He’s undoubtedly got a place to take her; he has to have a place to hold her without anyone knowing; where he can dispose of a body.”</p>

<p>Joe Amantia snapped his fingers. “He’s got a place.” I could see the shine in Joe’s dark eyes. “I remember a part of a report in his loyalty file, on the amount of big dough he was spending. He’d bought a summer home of some sort, along the river some ten or so miles above Glen Echo.”</p>

<p>The pretty-boy desk clerk had retired to his droopy position behind the desk, ignoring us.</p>

<p>We got back into the car, “It’s a chance,” said Nichols.</p>

<p>“The only one,” said Amantia.</p>

<p>I just sat tight in the rear seat, my heart thundering my throat.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Joe drove like the devil. We roared out of the city and over the highway that led beyond the Glen Echo amusement park. On the highway he hit each curve and gunned the sedan all the way around, snapping it out on the other side. His face was set, saturnine, glued to the road. A Metropolitan Police cruiser gave chase just as we cleared the city line.</p>

<p>We sped on. About ten miles beyond the park, in Maryland territory, we slewed off the pike and onto a narrow blacktop road. To our left the land sloped down to the edge of the river. It was overgrown with brush, trees, but here and there a clearing showed, and an occasional cottage where the Capital City’s wealthier citizens came to escape the summer’s humidity.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Nichols growled, “There!”</p>

<p>Joe slammed on the brakes and sliced the car into a narrow gravel road that angled off from the blacktop and down the slope toward the water. Tire marks on the gravel, and broken branches of the trees that screened and overhung the road, had caught the sharp eye of Nichols. A car had recently come through. We gunned down the lane and braked into a grassy clearing before another of the summer homes.</p>

<p>Just as we came to a halt, the car that had been standing before the cottage began to move, toward the river below. I caught a glimpse of cherry-brown hair in it, and I shouted and ran. It rolled on into the water. It was sinking rapidly as I burst crazily into the river, leaping toward the sinking car, forgetting all my hurts.</p>

<p>As the heavy thing sank with a great gurgle, the suction pulled me after it. My head rose once above the water, then I thrashed wildly down, trying mightily to find the car.</p>

<p>Somehow, by accident, I caught a door handle, as the sedan settled on its side. My lungs felt about ready to burst, but I pulled on the handle and the door opened, against the weight of the water. The water rushed in, but not before I found my searching fingers grasp hold of a soft form.</p>

<p>I backed water, kicking furiously, pulling on the object, and then I got her free. Up we went.</p>

<p>Nichols was knee deep at the water’s edge and dragged us in. Like a boy scout, he began giving the limp form of the girl artificial respiration. I felt I needed it, too, but I stayed on my feet, spitting out oodles of river. Then I heard the voices.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Paul Pleven was standing at the door to the summer home, his tall, bony body tense, his strange eyes glittering. “So,” he said to Amantia, “the FBI. Has this crackpot Wilkins got you into his game, whatever it is?”</p>

<p>I dragged myself to where Joe confronted the man. “What’s your version?” I asked.</p>

<p>The sneery mouth again. “The way I see it,” he said, “In order to smear me, blaming me for your own misfortune, you, Wilkins, sold Miss Morgan a bill of goods, that I was a spy in my own organization, that I was responsible for the murder of her brother, that I tried to make a scapegoat of you…”</p>

<p>“But,” interjected the Federal agent, “What about that?” He indicated Nichols working on Dee Morgan.</p>

<p>“I admit, sir,” said Pleven, “Miss Morgan and I had an argument. I tried to show her the error of her ways, believing whatever guff this Wilkins had handed her. But mad with grief over the death of her brother, she was willing to believe him. She was irrational. Just before you people drove down the road, she ran out and got into my car. I guess she couldn’t drive very well, and in her irate condition, she apparently lost control and headed for the river. I, er, unfortunately, am not a good swimmer; I couldn’t have helped.”</p>

<p>“It won’t work, Paul,” I said, the pain biting at my lips.</p>

<p>He sneered.</p>

<p>“The girl isn’t dead,” said Joe, “And I think she’ll tell a different story.”</p>

<p>“An irrational one, I’m sure.” Pleven still held his poise, but his pale eyes grew more wary.</p>

<p>“We know too much, Pleven,” Amantia said. “We know Miss Morgan’s suspicions came from her brother, not from Wilkins. She still has her brother’s letters, you know.”</p>

<p>Paul Pleven stiffened.</p>

<p>Nichols called, then. “She’s coming ‘round.”</p>

<p>Both Joe and I turned. Paul Pleven saw his chance. He made a desperate dash for the Federal agent’s car. But somehow I got in his way. Some effort, from wherever I could drag it out of my weary, aching body, put me in his path. He tried to hit me.</p>

<p>I socked him in his skinny gut with my right fist I balled my left and splintered it against his bony chin. He dropped to the grass and I fell on top of him, my eyes blood-red, rage tearing at me. Wildly, uncontrollably, I pummeled. Then Joe was pulling me from him.</p>

<p>Paul Pleven lay, sobbing, his face a mess of blood. Joe listened with me to the blood-smeared confession as it came from the thin, cruel lips. As I looked down on the vermin, I thought how much he was like many of the others I had seen. A touch of violence administered to them, and they babble like babies.</p>

<p>And then I had Dee Morgan in my arms and nothing else seemed to matter.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Pleven’s confession led to the cleaning up of another of the putrid sores that infest the fair face of democracy, but it did not lead us any closer to the shadowy figure whose slimy fingers reach, octopus-like, into all the foul corners of the world. Uncle Sam still fights, still seeks the bloody racketeers, knowing that, even now, American boys are dying on foreign fields, killed by American-made ammunition. And I am back on the job, in the midst of the fight.</p>

<p>Dee, happiness tempered by concern in her eyes, helped me celebrate the night I was reinstated with the Munitions Division. “I used to worry about Johnny so much,” she said, “and wait to bear from him, to see him. He was all I had then.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” I whispered, kissing her cheek, for this time I sat beside her, not opposite her, “you’ll have some more worrying and waiting, darling.”</p>

<p>“Must you do it, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “I must. Now more than ever,” I squeezed her hand, “because I have something more to work for.”</p>

<p>Dee Morgan squeezed my hand in return. “Let’s forget it for now, Dan. Until you go gunning for death again, let’s steal a moment for peace —and love.”</p>
