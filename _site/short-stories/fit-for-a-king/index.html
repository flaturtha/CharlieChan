<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="a-house-of-mystery">A House Of Mystery</h3>

<p>Men who read books, with whom I have talked more than a little in my
spare time, are fond of quoting Shakespeare. Perhaps they quote others,
but mine is a mind like President Wilson’s—one poetic train is enough on
my single-track—and so I can’t remember the rest. One quotation sticks
particularly in my memory.</p>

<p>It is something about “There is a tide in human affairs which, taken at
its flood, leads on to victory.” Perhaps that isn’t quite right. It has
been a long time since I have read it, because working up and down the
Strait of Juan de Fuca and the beaches of the North Pacific, one can’t
carry much of a library.</p>

<p>But what made it stick with me was that thing in it about the tide. You
know the tide and the waves are like a woman; they can’t keep anything
secret for very long. Just give them time and they will tell all about
it. A woman can’t keep a secret— neither can the sea.</p>

<p>That fellow knew what he was talking about when he wrote that, but he
did not know it half so well as we did, because he did not know how much
we depend on the tide and the surf for our tips on what the smugglers
and other criminals are doing along our uninhabited coasts. If it were
not for the help of the sea we would surely be lost.</p>

<p>It was a wave—a big one, unwelcome at the time, unasked and rough, as
waves usually are—that solved for me one of the greatest mysteries our
service was ever called upon to run down, and one which had baffled our
best men for more than a year.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you about it.</p>

<p>Do you remember James J. Plainfield, the man who made twenty or thirty
millions out of railway and steamship lines in the West and died a few
years ago? You do, I guess; everybody does. I never met him myself, but
at the time I am speaking of it was part of my day’s work to look up him
and his past history pretty thoroughly.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of a place he built out here on the West Coast to
entertain a king? He called it the “Aerie”—eagle’s nest, you know. He
was that kind of a fellow—big and rough and blustering but with a sort
of poet’s imagination. It was that which had brought him up from a
common sailor to what he was and which gave him the idea when his chance
came to have a real king as a guest, to build this place up on the rocks
to take him to and stand with him up there where he could take in the
whole Pacific with one sweep of his hand and say, “Here, King, see this
ocean? Well, I control that.”</p>

<p>He’s dead now, Plainfield is, but the king isn’t. I’ve got two letters
at home from His Royal Highness—one asking for full details of what I
found out about his friend’s house on the cliff and the other thanking
me for my report. I don’t mind saying that in the second one he says
that he feels sure that if I had been on the job he would have been
perfectly safe.</p>

<p>Of course that is more of a compliment, like some kings like to make,
than anything else, because this king never saw the “Aerie.” He got too
busy with a war they were having over in Europe and had to cancel his
acceptance of Jim Plainfield’s invitation. Jim Plainfield, himself, got
pretty busy in that same war in the shipping end of it, and I guess he
and all the rest of the world would have pretty nearly forgotten all
about the “Aerie” if a newspaperman in Seattle hadn’t assembled a lot of
facts and strung them together in a sensational story he called “The
House of Fatal Mystery” which was copied all over the country.</p>

<p>That was the way I got in on it. The big chiefs in Washington read it
and, as it was in our territory, we got orders to look into the matter,
and it surely did seem serious and mysterious enough for somebody to
look into.</p>

<p>It seems that in six months no less than four men, who were last seen in
the neighborhood of the “Aerie,” had disappeared off the face of the
earth. More than that, two women, who couldn’t tell what had happened to
them or the missing men they had accompanied to the House on the Cliff,
had been found exhausted and more than half crazy in the big woods that
the place on three sides surround.</p>

<p>It was a House of Mystery all right, but as fine a structure as you ever
saw. Plainfield had given orders that it was to be “fit for a king”— and
it was in more ways than one.</p>

<p>It was a sort of glorified log cabin, something like what I understand
they call chalets or hunting lodges in Europe, but I don’t believe there
is one in Europe like this House on the Cliff. Jim Plainfield, as I
said, had been a common sailor, but he had a soul far above tar and
ropes and canvas. He had roamed the far seas and seen a lot. He had
studied a lot. And, when the riches came, he kept on traveling and
seeing and reading. He loved the sea and his big yacht, the Fir, was a
common sight on every ocean.</p>

<p>It was in this way he met the king. I never knew the exact details, but
I believe he saved the king’s life or something like that during a yacht
club regatta. At any rate, their friendship became common knowledge, and
when the king planned a visit to America it was common gossip that he
would be Plainfield’s guest when he reached the Coast.</p>

<p>Plainfield was always a very busy man and depended for details a great
deal upon subordinates who had been with him for years, in most cases.
So even in so important a matter as the building of this house for a
king he only went as far as drawing the plans and giving directions for
the furnishings. The actual superintendence of the thing, we learned,
had been left to a man named Harry Stanwood, who had been steward of the
big yacht, valet to Plainfield and generally his man of affairs in minor
business and quite largely in social matters.</p>

<p>So, while the boss planned the house, it was really Stanwood who built
it and had it all ready with every convenience to receive a king, and it
was some job, too, out in that wilderness. Materials had to be hauled
for miles and labor was very scarce. Stanwood, who was something of a
mechanic, had to do a good deal of the work himself, but he had plenty
of time, so it did not make a great deal of difference.</p>

<p>He was a most interesting sort of character. We found out all about him,
because in our investigation we started out with Plainfield himself and
gradually took in everybody who had had anything to do with the “Aerie.”
Naturally Stanwood came second, because when the war came on and it was
found that the king could not come and Plainfield became so busy with
his shipping interests, he left Stanwood in charge of the house with
permission to do as he pleased—practically gave it to him.</p>

<p>There used to be some gay old times out there, and Harry Stanwood became
well known in all the Puget Sound country for his hospitality at the
expense of his boss. It was war time and everybody was more or less on
edge with war worry and speculation and German spy scares and one thing
and another. It seemed to be a great relief to a lot of people to go out
to the “Aerie” for a few days and sort of rest up.</p>

<p>Out there one could forget the war. Plainfield, himself, was above
suspicion. Stanwood, the financially receptive host of the place, was
past fifty years of age, apparently not desired for war duty and by his
own statements of many years an Englishman—a statement borne out by his
speech, manner and conversation.</p>

<p>Besides that, the State of Washington had voted “dry,” but the “Aerie”
never seemed to have heard of the law going into effect. Stanwood ran no
bar, but the cellar stock was checked against each paying guest and the
cellar itself, in a sort of cave under the cliff, was one of the house’s
principal points of interest. It was big enough to house a regiment—a
natural formation in the rock upon which the house was built—and upon
those notable occasions when Stanwood himself was host to his own
particular cronies, he frequently ordered supper served underground
where the wine and spirits were handy.</p>

<p>Not many people knew of the place. I have always doubted if Plainfield
ever knew anything at all about what went on there, but among those who
did know, the “Aerie” was a celebrated rendezvous. That was so until
this newspaper article with its array of gruesome facts threw a damper
of dark mystery about the whole region, cut off Stanwood’s source of
revenue and probably hastened the death of Plainfield, which occurred
within a few months and before the mystery surrounding his chalet had
been solved.</p>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="aerie">“Aerie”</h3>

<p>We were really first drawn into the case in a sort of semi-official and
confidential capacity. One of the men who had disappeared thereabout was
a former assistant to a Cabinet officer who still had many friends in
Washington. The circumstances were such that they did not want to call
in the regular peace officers of the State of Washington. There was a
matter of a little spree and a woman or two involved. We were called in
as much to avoid publicity as anything else, but we got in good and
deep—we and our old friend, the sea, after we had watched in vain for it
to give up a body.</p>

<p>I won’t mention this man’s name. We succeeded in keeping the facts quiet
and avoiding scandal even after we found his body. It’s the way we have
in the service. But you must have read in the newspapers about the
others. We found them and we also checked up on the two women found half
crazy in the woods. I don’t wonder that they were.</p>

<p>Naturally, we were first suspicious of the people at the house itself.
There is nothing particularly suspicious about four or five people dying
or disappearing in the course of a few weeks or months in this big world
of ours, but when they happen to do so in the immediate vicinity of an
isolated place up on a cliff looking out over the Pacific and none of
them has any connection with one another, save through visiting this
spot, something seems to be wrong. It is like there was a regular fog of
suspicion clustering about the whole locality and we plunged in first
where the fog was thickest.</p>

<p>But the trouble was to find the people who were or had been connected
with the “Aerie.” Stanwood was in charge, but it was easily found out
that he spent most of his time in Seattle, Portland, Vancouver or
Victoria. Indeed, the facts stood out like sore thumbs that he had been
particularly conspicuous in one or another of these cities upon the
dates of the mysterious disappearances, that he had seemed greatly
concerned over them and had himself led the searching parties that had
recovered the two women but had been unable to find any trace whatever
of the four men.</p>

<p>Outside of him we could find no one regularly connected with the place
except Song Chin, a Chinaman of the usually mystical age of forty or
eighty or thereabout, who so completely “no- sabbied” everything except
expert cooking that we had to give him up and put him in the same class
with the rocks and the trees and the ocean. Rather, considering the fact
that sermons are said to come from stones, that the big firs distinctly
sing and that the waves roar in anger when their long ocean trip is
ended at the coast, Song was dumbest of them all.</p>

<p>There were a couple of young Indians who puttered about the place
occasionally, cutting firewood and sometimes acting as guides in the
woods or handling a few canoes and a motorboat that were kept in a
sheltered cove about half a mile down the coast from the rocky crest
where the house stood. But they were no different from a couple of
hundred other young bucks along the coast and indeed Stanwood seemed to
have employed a lot of them rather indifferently from time to time. It
was true, as he explained, that a month’s pay was enough to last one of
them half a year and they usually quit on pay day.</p>

<p>There was a garage, but no chauffeur or mechanic. Stanwood was fully
qualified to act in both of these capacities and indeed that was one of
the reasons Plainfield had put him in charge of the house. He was a
whole crew of servants in himself. During the time that guests were on
the cliff, we found that it had been the custom for them to bring their
own servants—a couple of Japanese boys or a maid sufficing for these
visits, which were generally of a sort in which the utmost privacy
seemed to be desirable.</p>

<p>So we were up against it, so far as the house staff was concerned, and
forced to attack at the mysterious house itself.</p>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="a-hair-raising-trip">A Hair-Raising Trip</h3>

<p>It was a twelve-mile ride through a huge forest of firs over a private
road to reach the place and outside of a few scattered and tangled wood
trails this was the only way to reach the “Aerie.” Loggers had never
penetrated that section and the underbrush was too thick to make the
country attractive either for hunters or for deer or bear themselves. It
was one of those places where the forest remains just as God planted it,
waiting its turn to serve its purpose in the world.</p>

<p>From the sea, as we finally saw it, the place seemed the most
inaccessible spot in the world. Standing high on a great cliff, the
waves beat interminably on jagged rocks that formed its base. Always the
spray seemed to dash halfway up this great 300-foot pedestal upon which
the house stood. Down below was the little cove in which the canoes and
the motorboats were stored, but even these had been dragged to the spot
through the forest and the nearest really safe havens for watercraft
were fifty miles south and in Barclay Sound beyond the Strait of Juan de
Fuca far to the north.</p>

<p>It was heart-breaking work, but it had to be done. We quartered and
crisscrossed that whole tangled section of primeval forest. We made
trails through parts of it that not even a pheasant had ever seen, so
thick was it. Ahead of us we drove Indian guides and Scandinavian axemen
until they were reeling with weariness, wet with perspiration and soaked
with the eternal dampness of these woods, and nothing could we find.
Finally, absolute exhaustion drove us back to the “Aerie” to rest up,
but principally we went there to collect our frazzled wits and think
things over.</p>

<p>Naturally, we had made a complete search of the house—or as complete as
we could. Stanwood had not been there at the time. He had pleaded
important business in Seattle and as we had him constantly shadowed in
the city, we were rather glad of his absence, but he came out while we
were there the second time and with him along with us we went through
the house again with a fine-toothed comb, to say nothing of flashlights,
jimmies and other tools. We had said we were going to tear the whole
house apart until we had solved the mystery. But we didn’t find
anything.</p>

<p>The house itself was a beauty. Built all on one floor, with the
exception of an observatory on the roof to give it a little touch of
distinction, I imagine, it was apparently hewn out of solid logs from
the little clearing behind it. Even the floors were of solid slabs of
cedar and so was the woodwork with which the interior was finished.</p>

<p>From the rear, or the land side, you stepped into an entrance hall
alongside the kitchen and from there into a great combined living- and
dining-room that took up the whole center of the house. To the right
were four or five bedrooms and to the left the private suite built for
the personal use of the king. In front of this was a sort of sun-parlor
and study and a private dining-room, and along the side a huge
bedchamber with a massive bed in it made out of native cedar.</p>

<p>Most of the beds in the house were of the usual brass variety but the
royal couch was a huge and most interesting affair. Stanwood confided to
us that he had made it himself for Plainfield’s room, but the boss had
done him the honor of selecting it for the king because it was such a
fine example of the craftsman’s skill. It was, indeed. We all had to
take our hats off to Stanwood as a master at carpenter work.</p>

<p>He had a marvelous set of woodworking tools and he seemed to be more
worried about them than about anything else as we searched the house,
ruining the edge of one after another as we tested floors and walls and
sought to pry up huge timbers with delicate chisels. We tapped and
tested and sawed and bored until the house was pretty near a wreck. And
still we could not find anything.</p>

<p>At last, as the best boatman in the party, I volunteered to make a
search of the ocean front. We had done it before from the motorboat,
keeping well off the rocks and searching the face of the cliff through
binoculars. But I wanted to get in closer and finally persuaded an
Indian to go with me in a canoe. It was plain he did not want to go. I
had to talk real rough to him, but he knew about the federal prison on
McNeil Island and he recognized my badge. He figured that the sea was
safer than my anger and we started out.</p>

<p>It was a hair-raising trip, although we had selected the ebbing tide of
a fairly calm day for our exploration. Even on the ebb the swells of the
wide Pacific were torn into surf by great hidden rocks and dashed into
foaming spray as they were broken by the claws of the cliff. We could
only edge in a way, then turn and paddle for our lives —turn back and
try it over again the same way.</p>

<p>Not much satisfaction in that sort of work, I soon decided, but the sea
has always been my ally in duty along the coast and I had a hunch it
would help us out in this baffling case and I was playing that hunch
strong. Just as we edged in for the last time I saw something—a shadow,
it might have been, or a discoloration in the cliff, but at any rate it
was something—and dropped my glasses to seize my paddle to swing in
closer, but before I could dip we were nearly capsized on a hidden rock
and only the caution of the Indian, whose muscles had already been set
for flight, saved us from death as the vision was snatched from my eyes.</p>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="four-invited-guests">Four Invited Guests</h3>

<p>When I got back the other fellows listened politely enough but they were
too busy with another angle of the case to take my fleeting vision very
seriously. Brierly and Campbell were seated at the big table in the
living-room with the notes and papers they had taken from their pockets
before them. Stanwood was in his room and Corrigan was keeping watch on
things outside, as one of us always did.</p>

<p>Brierly was talking, or rather thinking aloud, as he reviewed the facts
we all knew and sought to find some hidden meaning in them.</p>

<p>“There was Adams,” he said, “the first one to drop out, Seattle
shipbuilder, supposed to be a millionaire, bachelor and privileged to
have brought this Miss Johnson here with him if he wanted to, I suppose.
No discoverable reason for running away or committing suicide. No idiot
would try to run away from here on foot anyway.</p>

<p>“The Johnson girl knows nothing about it or I’m a Dutchman. Says he went
to the king’s room to go to bed, she heard him scream and the room was
empty when she got there. Windows all closed—no other door. No one here
who could run the car and after two day’s of it she went sort of off her
head and tried to get out on foot.</p>

<p>“Then come Hunt and Terwilliger. They were here together and alone
except for a Jap valet and chauffeur. No one knows what door they went
through. The Jap says he had gone to his room over the garage after
eating his supper and that they were gone in the morning. Certainly they
left the car behind. Both were good friends, prosperous business men,
happily married, out here, apparently, just for a little rest.</p>

<p>“Now we come to the boss’s friend. What happened to him? Successful
lawyer, fine record, brilliant future, no troubles that we know of. Bit
of a rounder, he was, they say, and I guess it’s true if that Kilmer
girl came out here with him. Tried to find him, she says, after he
vanished. Doesn’t remember where she last saw him, she says, but thinks
it was some place inside the house here. Now what became of him?”</p>

<p>“What in hell became of any of them?” Campbell answered with a shrug of
his shoulders.</p>

<p>We were silent for several minutes. Then Brierly shifted his position
suddenly and hurriedly relighted his pipe— a sign that he had an idea,
or at least thought he had.</p>

<p>“What business was Adams in?” he demanded of us.</p>

<p>“Shipbuilding, you idiot,” I answered, because he knew as well as I did.</p>

<p>“And what business were Hunt and Terwilliger in?” was his second
question.</p>

<p>“Airplane spruce—what’s the idea?” I grunted in reply.</p>

<p>“And the boss’s friend. What was his game? Lawyer, wasn’t he, but what
kind of clients did he have?”</p>

<p>That set Campbell and me to thinking. Who were his clients?</p>

<p>“Corporation lawyer, wasn’t he?” Brierly asked, eagerly. “Handled things
in a legal way for big firms, gave advice to big manufacturers, didn’t
he?”</p>

<p>We agreed that he did.</p>

<p>“Was he attorney for Adams’s shipyard?” Brierly went on. “He was. Here’s
his name on the letterhead as one of the directors. He was general
counsel for Hunt and Terwilliger’s lumber company, wasn’t he? You bet he
was and a stockholder in it, too.</p>

<p>“Is it just a coincidence or is there anything funny in the fact that
all four of these men were big figures in the munitions business out
here?”</p>

<p>Campbell took his feet down from the table and I started scratching my
head as this new angle soaked in. They were in the munitions
business—all four of them—but who—how—what connection was there between
that fact and their mysterious disappearances? Neither Campbell nor
myself are particularly quick thinkers. We sat silently, waiting for
Brierly to go on.</p>

<p>“Why did these men come out here?” he asked. “Was this place advertised
for rent? No. Very few people knew anything about it and you know that
Stanwood refused several pretty good oilers from people who did know,
but whom he didn’t want out here for some reason or other. Some people
asked to come and were allowed to do so. We know who they were and know
that they paid well for the privilege. They got back all right and told
some of their friends about the place.</p>

<p>“But how did these missing men get out here? Tell me that.”</p>

<p>I turned to Campbell. He had done most of that end of the investigation
and I was not quite sure of this angle of the case myself.</p>

<p>“Stanwood invited them,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Sure of that?” asked Brierly.</p>

<p>“Positive. He urged all four of them to come. Why? What the devil are
you driving at anyway?”</p>

<p>For answer, Brierly leaped from his chair and ran softly from the room
over to the bedroom wing of the house. He opened the door into the hall
noiselessly and disappeared for a moment.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he reported as he resumed his seat. “Stanwood’s in his
room, reading.”</p>

<p>“What of it?” Campbell wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Just that we’ve got to make sure that he stays there or some place else
where we can find him when we want him,” was the reply. “Go tell
Corrigan to keep an extra eye open and then hustle back here.”</p>

<p>We smoked in silence until Campbell came back and Brierly was ready with
a new line of questions. He was a man who thought a lot and let his
thoughts sort of simmer in his head until they jelled. Then he was ready
to talk and when he talked it was to some purpose. “Who is Stanwood?” he
demanded. “Englishman,” I answered. “Sort of upper-class servant. Has
worked for Plainfield for years. Gambles, drinks and runs with women
when the boss isn’t here.”</p>

<p>“How do you know he’s English?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t,” I admitted. “But lie’s been accepted as English here
and over in Canada for a long time. Talks about England and all that
sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“Humph,” grunted Brierly. “Remember that Austrian chap we rounded up
after he blew up that ship in Seattle harbor last month? What was his
name?”</p>

<p>“Good-looking, well educated chap,” I muttered. “Why it was—Stan—
Stan—,” and I turned to Campbell, who had made the arrest.</p>

<p>“Goshamighty, Stanwich,” Campbell exploded.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Brierly, with an air of great satisfaction. “Stanwich.
And do you remember that our friend inside there showed a particularly
keen interest in that case and that he was asking about it only this
morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I nodded; “but what possible connection is there between that and
this case here?”</p>

<p>“Just this,” said Brierly, slowly and distinctly: “I’ve a lot more than
a hunch that our friend is no more English than Song Chin, that his name
is Stanwich and not Stanwood, that these two men are either brothers or
cousins and both on the same job.”</p>

<p>“You mean—?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I mean that the fellow in jail down in Seattle destroys munitions ships
and the fellow in here destroys munitions makers and that they both work
for the same boss. These four men were all munitions makers and Stanwood
either murdered them or knows how they were murdered.”</p>

<p>It was a little too much for me and I sat still, thinking hard. Campbell
started up and made for the hall door, but Brierly halted him.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” he called.</p>

<p>“Sweat it out of the devil,” he answered.</p>

<p>Brierly shook his head.</p>

<p>“Can’t be done,” he said. “He’s too deep for that. There’s a trap in
this house some place and we’ve got to find it.” Then he turned to me.
“What was that again you thought you saw on the side of the cliff?”</p>

<p>I explained again and we waited for Brierly. He was senior man and
besides had the clearest head in the party and we readily agreed as he
outlined his plan.</p>

<p>“Campbell,” he said, “you and Corrigan go through the king’s bedroom
again. It’s the most likely place and that’s where the girl says Adams
disappeared with a scream. Mac, I hate to ask you to do it, because I
know how dangerous it is, but you’re the best boatman and we ought to
know what that thing is you saw. I’ll relieve Corrigan outside and think
things over.”</p>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="four-dead-men">Four Dead Men</h3>

<p>Campbell and Corrigan went at their job at once, but I had to wait for
the next ebb tide, and before I left I made sure that one man at least
would be on the edge of the cliff with a coil of rope in case things
went wrong. I knew there wasn’t much chance for a capsized man among
those rocks, but if I did hit trouble a rope was the only possible
chance for my life.</p>

<p>I couldn’t find an Indian anywhere about the place. I think they had an
idea I might want to go out there again. And so I had to go alone in a
lighter canoe. The sea was a little smoother than before, or rather a
little less rough. You couldn’t call it smooth at all. I crept in closer
and closer, while Campbell watched from the top of the cliff. I didn’t
dare use the glasses because the paddle took both hands, but I found the
spot I had seen and kept my eyes on it. Plainer and plainer it grew as I
edged toward it and I let out a whoop of satisfaction as I saw a narrow
opening in the rock.</p>

<p>I waved an arm at Campbell and turned my head to make sure of the back
track through the surf when I saw a big comber almost on top of me. I
don’t know where it came from. They happen that way sometimes. But it
was coming all right and I would have said my prayers if I had had time.
It caught the little canoe like a barrel at the crest of Niagara, and in
a huge surge of water and blinding spray, I dashed straight at the
cliff.</p>

<p>I didn’t guide the canoe. God, or somebody else did that. But the next
thing I knew, I flew between jagged rocks that scraped the sides of the
canoe and then with a sickening lurch and a flop I slid into quiet
water, twilight and then darkness. I had hit the fissure in the rocks
and was inside a huge cave.</p>

<p>Two or three minutes later I had managed to pull myself together enough
to look about. I was shivering more from the shock of being alive than
anything else. But I managed to find matches and scrambled out into the
shallow tide pool. I couldn’t see any roof about me, but I threw pebbles
as high as I could without striking anything and when I shouted I
decided from the sound that it must be mighty high. I had slid in about
fifty feet and, lighting one match after another, I felt my way back
into the darkness to see what was there.</p>

<p>Only a few steps had I taken when I came to a wall, which I could see
was a sort of a shelf about twenty feet high, and climbed it. There on
the rocky floor was the solution of our mystery, if not the key to it.</p>

<p>Four bodies. Four dead men twisted and broken as they fell to their
death from far above. Adams, Hunt, Terwilliger and the boss’s friend, I
had not a doubt, but I did not stop to make sure. My last match was in
my fingers and I had some job ahead if I were not to join them.</p>

<p>Scrambling down the wall I splashed toward the sunlight at the mouth of
the cave where the surf still boiled about the jagged rocks. To swim
through it was impossible. My only chance was to find a pinnacle I could
climb and trust to Campbell and his rope. Fortunately, there was one a
few feet out of the opening, and, watching for a calmer moment, I leaped
and caught it in my arms and clung there drenched and lacerated but
above the pull of the receding waves.</p>

<p>Finally I managed to squirm around so I could look up and saw Campbell
and Corrigan, flat on their stomachs, leaning over the edge of the cliff
and waving to me. In a minute the rope was lowered with a loop on the
end of it and into this I thrust my arms. They hauled me up with a few
more bruises and cuts, but I was alive and the rest didn’t matter much.</p>

<p>Breathlessly I told Brierly what I had found and gave him the
approximate measurements and directions of the cave. Quickly he paced it
off and where do you think we located the spot above the pile of bodies?
The bed in the king’s chamber!</p>

<h6 class="btt"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h6>

<hr />

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="a-house-fit-for-a-king">A House Fit For A King</h3>

<p>We didn’t waste any more time then but went for Stanwood. He knew that
something unusual was going on and was nervously pacing up and down the
big living-room. Campbell and Corrigan grabbed him and we hustled him in
beside the bed he had told us he had built.</p>

<p>“Stanwich,” Brierly snarled, and the man winced at the name, “you are
standing directly above the bodies of four men you murdered. How did you
do it and why?”</p>

<p>The words shook the man to his marrow, but he still kept part of his
nerve. He denied the charge, denied his name, denied everything, but as
I described what I had seen, he broke still further in a sort of
superstitious terror, which I couldn’t understand for a time. Brierly
was an adept at the game and as he picked up an axe and attacked the
bed, the fellow leaped back with a squeal of alarm.</p>

<p>“So that’s it, eh?” said Brierly with a grin. “Come now, show us how it
was done and save a lot of trouble.”</p>

<p>He gave up at that and showed the devil’s trap. Hidden in the head of
the bed was a spring which, when he pressed it, released another spring
in the side of the couch, just where a man’s knee would rest when he
climbed into bed. Securing a pole, he pressed this spring from a safe
distance and swiftly the bed tilted at a sharp angle while a black hole
opened in the floor for an instant and then closed again into its
perfect jointures.</p>

<p>The scheme, he explained, as he grew calmer, was to set the spring at
the head of the bed only when the trap was to receive a victim. At other
times the room was perfectly safe. He might have set it for us, but did
not believe we could ever prove anything against him and also feared
that the fall of one of us would reveal his secret to the others.</p>

<p>His terror at my story, he explained, was due to the news that the
bodies were still under the house. He had found the chimney opening into
the cave when he came there to build the house and the trap was a
culmination of the discovery, but he could hear the waves washing down
below and believed that the bodies that fell through it would be washed
away with the next tide. Then, if they were ever found, it would be
supposed that they had tumbled from the cliff.</p>

<p>“But why did you kill these men?” Brierly demanded.</p>

<p>“I didn’t kill them,” he answered. “They fell while I was not here.”</p>

<p>“True, but you set the trap and then invited them here. Why did you do
it?” He was silent for a moment, then set his jaws and straightened his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“They were enemies of my country,” he said. “They were making munitions
to destroy my brothers. Why should I not destroy them?”</p>

<p>“But this house was built before the war,” Brierly insisted. “Why did
you build this infernal trap?”</p>

<p>“Because,” he answered slowly, “Mr. Plainfield ordered this house built
to entertain a king. I do not believe in kings. They are the enemies of
mankind. He ordered a house ‘fit for a king.’ I made it so.”</p>

<p>We drew back, startled at the hate that gleamed in his eyes and at the
cruel cunning of the radical bared before us. He saw his chance, and
before we could stop him, leaped through the window. Another instant and
he had thrown himself over the cliff to the rocks and surf below.</p>

<p>There isn’t much else to tell. We never found out who he really was. No,
I haven’t said what king it was who sent me those letters. Perhaps you
can figure it out for yourself.</p>
