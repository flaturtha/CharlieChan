<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="the-ugly-monster">The Ugly Monster</h3>

<p>"Here they come! You're going to lose your fifty francs, Tommy lad. I told you not to put it on that black beggar, even if you did think him a dark horse!"</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon Hawke, the world-famous detective of Dover Street, laughed boyishly as he lowered his glasses and stared at the horses tearing down the straight. It promised to be a very thrilling race, and the crowds who filled the stands were cheering wildly. At that time there was no hint of war clouds over Europe, and people of all nations were gathered there.</p>

<p>The meeting was taking place at Var, the racecourse of Nice, on the Cote d'Azure, and was one of the culminating events of the season.</p>

<p>Dixon Hawke and his brilliant young assistant, Tommy Burke, were taking a well-deserved holiday, and found that gay gathering and background of blue Mediterranean a welcome change from the fogs of London. Criminals and crime were forgotten for the moment.</p>

<p>With the Dover Street pair was Inspector Jean Dumoulin, the clever little Parisian detective of Sûreté fame. The excitable Frenchman threw his lavender-coloured gloves and grey top-hat high into the air at the sight of the leading horse.</p>

<p>"Voila! I make a win!" he yelled. "I am as chirpy as what-you-call the cricket bat on the heath, n'est-ce pas?"</p>

<p>"Cricket on the hearth, you mean, Jean," sighed Tommy, hastily grabbing at his hat before Dumoulin could fling it after his own. "Pinch the guv's hat if you want to dance on another one," he added.</p>

<p>"No, you don't!"</p>

<p>Hawke removed his hat just in time, and turned to grin at his Parisian colleague. He was perhaps the only member of that happy crowd near the rails who looked the other way as the horses thundered down the straight to the post.</p>

<p>Just over the way, behind the special paddock where the criminologist and his companions were standing, was the car park, and Hawke was somewhat surprised to note a crowd of some twenty or thirty people who were gathered round one of the machines. They formed a close circle, and swayed slowly to and fro as if they were controlled by one will.</p>

<p>The car was a big saloon model, painted a rich red, and blinds were carefully drawn over the windows. Idly enough, Hawke had noticed the same machine on the road when he had driven over from Mentone in his own Sunbeam.</p>

<p>Why a crowd of people should be more interested in a motor car than in the chief race of the Riviera season was puzzling, and Hawke's detective instincts caused him to focus attention. He swung his glasses, and frowned when he took a closer look at the faces of the people.</p>

<p>They were a cosmopolitan gathering, but they were all alike in the rigidity of their expressions and the pasty whiteness of their complexions. Some great emotion was holding them spellbound.</p>

<p>"Curious!" breathed Hawke.</p>

<p>He turned quickly as a wild yell from Tommy and a perfectly fiendish howl from Dumoulin announced the final of the race.</p>

<p>The big black horse which Tommy had favoured was boring through the pack with only a few lengths to go. Very slowly it drew level with the roan which had been Dumoulin's fancy, and as the post was reached forged on to win by a head. The cheering was deafening.</p>

<p>"Here's my hat, Jean!" laughed Tommy. "You can jump on it. I win two hundred francs, so I guess I can buy another one.'"</p>

<p>"Sacrebleu! But I have no more the desire to jump on the hat!" moaned the French detective. "Tiens, I am limp like the what-you-call wet rag."</p>

<p>He mopped his streaming forehead with his handkerchief, and his bright eyes shot a quick look at Hawke. "You have not the interest in the race," he said crisply.</p>

<p>"True enough," smiled the criminologist. "I was wondering what funny business was going on near that red car in the park. There was a crowd round it just now, but now they're going away. Jove, and I'm blessed if a couple of 'em haven't fainted."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they had their—is it not?—shirt on my horse," suggested Dumoulin, turning to look in the direction Hawke indicated. "Mais, mon, it is merely that band of lunatics."</p>

<p>"Lunatics?"</p>

<p>"The sacred Cult of Light," explained the little detective in French. "Have you not heard of them, my friend? They have a high priest who lives near Eze in a temple which his dupes built for him. One day I shall run him out of France. He is a negro from Central Africa, by name of Dinga, and I think that M'sieu Dinga is a great fraud."</p>

<p>Dumoulin cracked his fingers, and lapsed into his queer English again.</p>

<p>"Zut!" he snapped. "On the Cote d'Azure there are many with nothing to do but make fools of themselves.</p>

<p>"They have money, but no brains. A clever man has but to say that he has a great teaching so obscure that nobody can understand it, and he finds a following who will keep him in luxury. Pfff!"</p>

<p>The Frenchman gave an indignant snort.</p>

<p>"Let us forget M'sieu Dinga and his dupes," he said. "We will go back to Mentone, where there are no races, and I can forget there are such things as what-you-call dark horses."</p>

<p>Dixon Hawke laughed and squeezed the shoulder of his Parisian friend affectionately. Pushing their way through the chattering crowd, they hurried to the car park in the hope of getting away before the rush began.</p>

<p>The red saloon of the mysterious Dinga had already gone, but a few of his queer disciples still remained. Hawke frowned again when he looked at them. The Sacred Cult of Light did not seem to encourage health, if the shifty-eyed individuals nearby were typical examples of the disciples.</p>

<p>Tommy had started up the big grey Sunbeam, and presently they were purring along the Promenade des Anglais into Nice. There was a great press of traffic on the lower road which skirted the sea, and Tommy turned the car after a while and roared up a steep hill.</p>

<p>He was making for that magnificent mountain road known as the Grand Corniche, which runs all the way from Nice to Mentone. It was a relief to be away from the crowds and to look down many hundreds of feet of tumbling crags into the picturesque resorts which strung along the coast from Nice.</p>

<p>Ahead the Alps loomed up, snow-capped and gigantic. The air was so clear that it was possible to see beyond the grey rock of Monaco and pick out Mentone, which was their destination. Duraoulin had a small villa there, and had invited Hawke and Tommy to stay with him.</p>

<p>As they neared Eze, an ancient fortress town built on a lonely crag. Tommy slowed the car at sight of a police agent who was waving his arms for them to stop. The young fellow took a rapid glance at the speedometer.</p>

<p>"I was only doing sixty, and I didn't think they minded in France," he grumbled.</p>

<p>"And we do not!" rapped Dumoulin indignantly.</p>

<p>He leaned from the car and shot a rapid sentence at the agent, at the same time showing the cover of his police credentials. The agent jumped to the salute.</p>

<p>"It is a very fortunate thing you come this way, m'sieu," he said. "Mon Dieu, but it is terrible. There has been a most frightful murder!"</p>

<p>He pointed to something lying amongst the rocks nearby, and covered by his cycling cape. Dumoulin gave a sharp cry as he jumped from the car and ran over. He knelt down by the side of the shrouded body.</p>

<p>After a moment's hesitation Hawke followed. His sensitive mouth twisted into a wry grimace, for even amongst the flowers and sunshine of the Riviera it did not seem possible to escape the world of crime.</p>

<p>Together with Dumoulin he examined the body.</p>

<p>It was that of a man wearing the uniform of the Blue Devils or Chasseurs Alpin, the famous French troops that guarded the Alpine frontier. Dumoulin pointed to an ugly blotch which stained the front of the uniform.</p>

<p>"In the heart," he gasped. "A dagger thrust which took from us a gallant soldier. There is hot blood in Provence."</p>

<p>"But this was not the result of a hot-blooded attack," said Hawke grimly. "Look at the marks on the wrists. The poor fellow was bound when he was killed, and the straps were taken off after he was dead, which was not longer than an hour ago."</p>

<p>He covered the body and stood up.</p>

<p>"When did you find him?" he asked the agent.</p>

<p>"A few minutes ago, m'sieu. I was making my tour of the Comiche, and saw something lying amongst the rocks. I dismounted to investigate, and—voila!"</p>

<p>The agent spread out his hands and grimaced.</p>

<p>"A week ago there was another body," he mused. "My comrade found it almost at the same spot."</p>

<p>"Another?"</p>

<p>Hawke looked at Dumoulin, who had just rejoined him. The French detective had lit a cigarette, and his dark eyes were glittering like those of a hunting tiger. The gay little man of the racecourse at Var was not recognisable in Inspector Jean Dumoulin, of the Sûreté.</p>

<p>"Oui," he said briskly, "there was another murder in these parts just before you came down. The day of the Battle of Flowers at Cannes a postman was found dead. He vanished from the neighbourhood of Antibes, and yet he was found here."</p>

<p>"Stabbed?"</p>

<p>"Stabbed. I did not see the body, because I was here on holiday, and wished to forget those cochons of criminals who always trouble me. Zut! But now I think, his wrists were also tied."</p>

<p>"One could almost connect the two crimes," mused Hawke.</p>

<p>"One almost could," agreed Dumoulin. "We are on holiday, however, so this must be an affair for the local authorities, but at least we will keep in touch."</p>

<p>He scribbled a note on the back of his card, and gave it to the agent. Then he joined Hawke and Tommy in the car, promising to stop at Eze to telephone for an ambulance.</p>

<p>"A curious affair," said Hawke. "He was not killed where he was found, Jean."</p>

<p>"You, too, then think—"</p>

<p>"That the body was abandoned there? I am certain. At the side of the road there was a spot where the herbage had been crushed by the fall of something heavy. There was a further mark a little farther down the slope. The poor fellow was flung there, Jean."</p>

<p>Dixon Hawke's long fingers tapped nervously on the padding of the seat. He glanced for a moment rather wistfully at the tranquil panorama of Cap Martin, thrusting far out into the blue sea. Then his sparkling eyes met those of Dumoulin.</p>

<p>"The poor fellow was thrown," he repeated. "He was thrown from a fast-moving car."</p>

<p>The French detective gave a low growl.</p>

<p>"And so was the body of the postman," he said.</p>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="the-black-cockerels">The Black Cockerels</h3>

<p>They drove on in silence for a few miles farther, the flavour of that beautiful drive being completely lost. The car was now approaching the ancient village of La Turbie, which crowns the hills about Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>Turning his head, Hawke noticed a high wall and a big archway cut out of the natural rock. A very strange house was built on the other side, and by the bright newness of it the criminologist realised that it had not been there very long.</p>

<p>The place was domed and spired. It was a somewhat vulgar copy of an Eastern temple, and Hawke leaned forward with considerable interest.</p>

<p>"What is that place?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Eh?" Dumoulin looked up, and then puffed out his cheeks in his familiar gesture of contempt. "Ah, that!" he sneered. "That is the temple of the Sacred Cult of Light. That is the fine home of Dinga, whose car you noticed at Var."</p>

<p>Hawke leaned forward and spoke to Tommy, who smoothly brought the racing machine to a standstill a few yards from the entrance. Rising in his seat, the criminologist stared back at the weird pile for some time. A puzzled frown puckered his forehead.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave a low exclamation, opened the door, and jumped into the road. Just then Dinga came out on to a veranda of the temple.</p>

<p>"Look, Hawke!" said Dumoulin excitedly. But Hawke was not interested. He walked along a few steps to a place where the wall had not yet been completed.</p>

<p>The gap was blocked with a high wire fence, and beyond that could be seen of all things, a small chicken farm. Numerous handsome birds were busy scratching the ground for food.</p>

<p>"He is interested in chickens when there has been a murder!" exclaimed Dumoulin. "Zut!"</p>

<p>"I bet the guv is as interested in that murder as you are," protested Tommy.</p>

<p>Dumoulin's bright eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"It is so," he said. "The brain of M'sieu Hawke works mysteriously. I will myself examine the chickens." He joined his colleague near the wire fence, and found him staring rather grimly at the birds. Hawke turned and took the little Frenchman by the arm.</p>

<p>"What do you see?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Chickens," said Dumoulin promptly.</p>

<p>"You don't! Look again, Jean."</p>

<p>The French detective pressed his face against the wire, and stared blankly for some minutes. Then he slowly rubbed the back of his head, while his eyes widened with wonder.</p>

<p>"They are cockerels," he said solemnly. "All of them are cockerels, and they are as black as that horse of Tommy's which beat my roan. It is curious."</p>

<p>"Very curious," agreed Hawke, a strange note in his voice. "I would like to know what the Sacred Cult of Light are doing with a farm of prize cockerels. I can hardly imagine Dinga running a business like that as a side line. Tell me, Jean—from which part of the world does he come?"</p>

<p>"I have been told. A moment, and it will come back to me. Zut! yes, he is from Basutoland."</p>

<p>"Jove!" breathed Dixon Hawke. "Jove!"</p>

<p>The healthy colour faded from his cheeks, and he became unnaturally pale as he turned away from the wire and started to walk back to the car. In some wonder Dumoulin followed him, and when they were near the archway in the wall the criminologist stopped.</p>

<p>"Listen, Jean," he said in a low voice, "I must see this man Dinga, and I must see the inside of his house."</p>

<p>"A warrant can be arranged."</p>

<p>"I'd rather not pay an official visit, and those birds give me an excuse. I'm going to pretend that I'm a bird fancier particularly interested in the breed he has in his farm."</p>

<p>Dumoulin shrugged his shoulders and lifted his brows in an expression of blank wonder. He turned and tapped his head significantly for the benefit of Tommy. Then he followed his friend through the arch.</p>

<p>They followed a dark path which wound through a grove of cypress trees. On every side the vegetation was thick and wild, the natural condition of the hilly slopes having been preserved when the house was built.</p>

<p>Somehow Dixon Hawke had a sensation of the brooding mystery of the jungle, of the dark forests of Africa, which were so well known to him. He stopped several times and sniffed at the air suspiciously.</p>

<p>"It smells like Africa," he declared crisply. "I suppose my imagination is running riot."</p>

<p>They came out suddenly on a broad terrace directly in front of the house. A big wicker chair was placed a few yards away, the back turned so that the occupant could receive the benefit of the sinking sun pouring its rays over a nearby ridge.</p>

<p>Hawke's foot scraped on the first of the steps leading to the terrace, and with that sound the man in the chair jumped up with surprising quickness.</p>

<p>His jump was like that of an animal, for he was actually in the air for a brief moment, and twirled to face the visitors before his feet again touched the ground.</p>

<p>The two detectives stared curiously at a very tall, powerfully-built negro, his great shoulders almost bursting through his well-cut jacket. Although he was a black, his features were finely shapen, his brilliant eyes almost hidden by heavy lashes. The native, lifting his head very high, returned their stares.</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>Dinga spoke in English, his voice very deep and booming like the echo of a gong. His long arms swung in front of him, the fingers crooked like claws. The knees were slightly sagged, and to Dixon Hawke, an athlete himself, it was obvious that the negro was poised for instant action.</p>

<p>The criminologist acted the part of a man who was somewhat embarrassed to find himself in the presence of a black. He cleared his throat with an agitated little cough.</p>

<p>"I saw those fine birds in the little farm attached to this house," he began. "I make a hobby of that breed, and I was hoping that your master—"</p>

<p>He got no further.</p>

<p>"I am master here!" boomed Dinga.</p>

<p>His great arms waved in the air, and he seemed to grow inches, even dwarfing Dixon Hawke.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, very sorry," muttered the criminologist, pretending to be more and more embarrassed. "Now, those birds interest me. I can see that they are prize cockerels, but I don't know how you manage to breed such a splendid type. I have tried, but failed. Now it is very curious that I have never heard you mentioned in the various journals which concern our interesting hobby."</p>

<p>Dinga's narrow brow puckered into great black creases. He stood there swaying slightly, and staring at the criminologist with undisguised suspicion. Then a gleam of intelligence showed in his eyes, and a slow, wide smile spread over his face.</p>

<p>"I do not keep birds for a hobby," he boomed.</p>

<p>"Well, now, fancy that!" gasped Hawke, playing the part of a rather vacant fool. "What a foolish mistake to make. I'm dreadfully sorry. I'll be going away."</p>

<p>He blinked at the tawdry front of the house.</p>

<p>"What a strange place," he said.</p>

<p>''You would like to see it?" suggested Dinga. "It is a temple."</p>

<p>"A temple?"</p>

<p>"To me!" boomed the black's powerful voice. "I am Dinga of the Sacred Cult of Light. I have a great truth which I share only with my disciples. I am the light of the world !"</p>

<p>Again he waved his huge arms above his head, while his broad chest heaved and expanded. Dinga was very imposing at that moment, although his European clothes did not fit in with his actions, which were entirely those of a native of the wilds.</p>

<p>"Really, really!" bleated Hawke. "How very interesting!"</p>

<p>Dumoulin turned away to hide a smile, for he appreciated the excellent acting of his friend. The stage had lost a great actor when Dixon Hawke became a criminologist.</p>

<p>The effect of those words on Dinga was to cause him to shrink from his great height to a slight stoop. He bared his teeth for a second in a nasty snarl, and then waved the visitors towards the house.</p>

<p>As they stepped over the threshold into the great hall the native clapped his hands smartly. A mustard- coloured servant, half-Portuguese and half Kaffir, appeared promptly. Dinga gave certain orders in a voice so low that Hawke could not catch a word of it. Then he turned back to his visitors.</p>

<p>"The Temple of Light!" he boomed.</p>

<p>"Now, isn't it very, very interesting!" said Dixon Hawke with the same foolish note in his voice.</p>

<h6 class="btt"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h6>

<hr />

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="a-near-thing">A Near Thing</h3>

<p>The interior of the temple was as tawdry and vulgar as the exterior. Gilt paint was everywhere, and the smell of stale incense caused Hawke and Dumoulin to cough and splutter.</p>

<p>The place consisted of one vast hall, off which Dinga's quarters opened. Straw matting covered the floor, and there were little rolled-up rugs on which the "disciples" doubtlessly squatted.</p>

<p>At the back of the place, carefully placed in the most gloomy position, was a huge shrouded shape. Dixon Hawke guessed it was some painted idol from Dinga's own country. There were heaps of flowers piled at the base of it.</p>

<p>"What charming flowers!" bleated the criminologist again. "There are so many flowers in this part of the country, however. Were you at the Battle of Flowers in Cannes, Mr—er—"</p>

<p>"Dinga," supplied the black. "Yes, I attended the Battle of Flowers."</p>

<p>The man spoke rather distantly, as if his thoughts were far away. Then all at once he whirled round, and again showed his perfect teeth in the beginning of a snarl.</p>

<p>"Do not ask me foolish questions!" he boomed.</p>

<p>His voice clanged and echoed in that huge hall, and Dixon Hawke gave a very well-acted jump. He coughed uneasily.</p>

<p>"We really must be going," he said.</p>

<p>"We must," agreed Dumoulin. "It is very kind of M'sieu Dinga to show us his temple."</p>

<p>Dinga swept them out before him. He had suddenly lost all interest in showing the temple to his visitors, and his curtness was so decidedly unpleasant that both Hawke and Dumoulin itched to kick him. For a negro, Dinga had lofty ways of treating whites.</p>

<p>On reaching the terrace he turned away with a muttered word of farewell. The man strutted as he walked to the end of the terrace, where it was possible to get a view of the road.</p>

<p>Hawke and Dumoulin again took the path through the cypress trees, but when they had gone a few paces a cheerful shout caused them to swing round. Tommy Burke was approaching in the company of the mustard-coloured servant. The young fellow was wiping his hands on a piece of waste.</p>

<p>"I've been doing a job," he explained. "This fellow came and asked me if I knew anything about cars. It was only a disconnected magneto cable after all, but it took a long time to find."</p>

<p>He grinned at his companion.</p>

<p>"No other little job you want done?" he asked. "Knives to be ground? Sewing machines oiled?"</p>

<p>The half-breed shook his head blankly, and leaned against the gateway as the trio climbed into the car. He began to roll a cigarette, and Hawke noticed that he spilt a great deal of tobacco.</p>

<p>Looking up at the terrace as the machine rolled smoothly forward, the criminologist was surprised to see Dinga watching them from above. The negro lifted his hand and made a peculiar signal to the servant, which was answered by a nod. A moment later a turn of the road hid the Temple of Light from view.</p>

<p>"Well," burst out Dumoulin, turning to Hawke excitedly, "what have you found out?"</p>

<p>"A lot, Jean. I know, for example, why Dinga breeds black cockerels."</p>

<p>"Tiens!"</p>

<p>"He breeds them for purpose of sacrifice," said Dixon Hawke quietly. "Have you ever heard of Voodoo?"</p>

<p>Dumoulin clapped his hands to his head. "Mon dieu!" he cried. "Of course! Indeed, I have no brains, and am not fit to be an inspector of the Sûreté. The black cockerels; always the natives of Basutoland make sacrifice of them to the great god of Voodoo. I shall surely kick myself for not thinking of that before."</p>

<p>"At sunrise and sunset they make those sacrifices," went on Dixon Hawke. "It is supposed to appease the spirits of evil—Voodoo. I think, Jean, that the Sacred Cult of Light is merely the old African devil worship brought up to date, and you've certainly got a good excuse to run Dinga out of France."</p>

<p>"When we reach Mentone " roared Dumoulin.</p>

<p>Hawke took him by the arm.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, old friend," he said. "I'd rather you left Dinga alone for the moment. I may find out something else."</p>

<p>He leaned forward and spoke to Tommy.</p>

<p>"Which car did they get you to fix, lad?" he asked,</p>

<p>"A big red saloon, guv," was the crisp answer. "I've got an idea somebody must have been playing a joke with that high-tension cable. I swear it was deliberately unscrewed and tucked away where it was difficult to find, and I'm also sure that there's a chauffeur somewhere who could have put it right."</p>

<p>Tommy was quiet for a moment as he steered the big machine through the narrow streets of La Turbie. As they came out of the village and rolled to the head of the winding hill leading to Monte Carlo he spoke again.</p>

<p>"I tried to look into the bus, but the windows have blinds fixed on the inside. The one peep I got through the back screen puzzled me a bit. Blessed if the thing wasn't fixed up like a private ambulance."</p>

<p>"An ambulance?"</p>

<p>"One of those pull-out hospital cot things, guv. Perhaps Dinga prefers to ride that way."</p>

<p>"Jove !" whistled Dixon Hawke.</p>

<p>He sat back as Tommy began to concentrate on the difficult stretch of road, which ran along the brink of sheer precipices as it twisted down and down into the Principality. This part of the Grand Comiche had a bad reputation as a danger spot, and Tommy, a cautious if fast driver, kept his foot ready on the brake.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hawke reached into the pocket of his light overcoat, and pulled out a copy of a Continental paper. He turned to the page which advertised various social events.</p>

<p>"A regatta at San Remo tomorrow, Jean," he said.</p>

<p>"Oui." The French detective looked up with a puzzled frown. "There is a regatta," he went on. "It will be the finish of the Italian Riviera season, and will be a good show. The speedboat championship of Europe is to be held there, is it not so?"</p>

<p>"There will be crowds there?"</p>

<p>"Huge crowds."</p>

<p>"Do you know the local commissario of the police?"</p>

<p>"At San Remo? But, yes, he is an old friend of mine. What is it that you want with an Italian chief of the police?"</p>

<p>"I want him to make sure that he has plenty of men on hand," rapped Hawke. "I want—"</p>

<p>The rest of the sentence was not finished, for at that moment the car, carefully negotiating a very dangerous curve, skidded violently. Tommy yelled madly at he fell back, with part of the broken steering column in his hand.</p>

<p>Brakes squealed and gears grated as he desperately tried to stop in the bare yard there was between them and death.</p>

<p>Hawke and Dumoulin sat bolt upright, staring wide-eyed beyond the windscreen down the tumbling crags which descended all the way to the upper part of Monaco. Less than five seconds had passed since the skid, and before there would be time for anybody to collect themselves and jump they would be over that dreadful drop.</p>

<p>Tommy, white-laced, and dripping with cold perspiration, was quite helpless. There was a grinding crash as the off-side front wheel caught in a length of fencing bordering the road. A terrific lurch followed.</p>

<p>"Jump!" yelled Hawke. "Jump!"</p>

<p>The front of the car was over the edge, but a moment later there was a shock which flung them violently forward, causing Tommy to drive his head against the unbreakable glass of the windscreen. The stout glass resisted the blow, but the young fellow would have been thrown from the car if Hawke had not reached out a long arm and caught him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>Again the car lurched, but this time very slightly. The dazed occupants found themselves poised on the edge of that frightful drop, the rear wheels on the road, and the bonnet jammed against the trunk of a tree which grew out from the rocks below.</p>

<p>It was a sheer miracle that they had not plunged to death.</p>

<p>Hawke hauled his assistant into the back of the machine, at the same time signalling to Dumoulin to scramble over the lowered hood into the road. A moment later he had bundled Tommy after him, and with one jump had joined the other two in safety.</p>

<p>They stood in the dusty roadway staring at each other in a daze of wonder. They could hardly believe that the miracle had happened, and that they were alive and unhurt.</p>

<p>"Jove!" breathed Dixon Hawke. "What a close shave!"</p>

<p>"A shave!" choked Dumoulin. "It was by the hair of the head that we did not go over down there. Zut! I have a steam-hammer in my breast, and not a heart."</p>

<p>"And as for me," breathed Tommy, "I think my heart was clean jerked out of position."</p>

<p>He began to breathe more freely after a moment's quietness, and then turned to his employer.</p>

<p>"Guv, I don't know what happened," he said. "The steering wheel came away in my hands. It was a most awful feeling when I found I couldn't turn the old bus away from that drop. I bet it's given me a million grey hairs."</p>

<p>"Jove, lad, but how could the steering column break with a machine like ours?"</p>

<p>"Beyond me, guv. I'd have sworn she was as mechanically perfect as the most carefully-nursed racing car. It's a rummy business. We must get hold of a truck to haul her back on the road, and then we can hold an inquest on her innards. That was the nearest to death we've been for a long, long time."</p>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="hawke-is-mysterious">Hawke Is Mysterious</h3>

<p>A military truck heading for one of the mountain forts happened to pass a few minutes later. The soldiers made a quick job in connecting ropes to the dangling machine and hauling it back to the road. With the exception of a crushed mudguard, no damage had been done.</p>

<p>Tommy whipped off his jacket, and dived underneath to examine the steering. When he finally thrust out his oil-blackened face he was trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>"Filed!" he gasped. "The steering column had been filed almost right through."</p>

<p>He crawled out and stood up, shaking his head with bewilderment. Then he described with full detail the condition of the steering which had almost been responsible for a triple tragedy.</p>

<p>"Somebody who's an expert with cars handled this job," he persisted. "It was a deliberate plot to kill us, and it was fixed by a crook who knew that we were going to take the Grand Corniche."</p>

<p>"But it was at Nice that we decided to take the Corniche," said Dumoulin. "How is it possible that the killer should know in advance what we ourselves did not know? Ah, non, Tommee, you make the what-you-call bloomer."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was done after we took the Corniche," suggested Dixon Hawke. "You forget, Jean, that we made a stop."</p>

<p>"At the house of Dinga!"</p>

<p>The criminologist nodded grimly.</p>

<p>"And don't forget," he added, "that Tommy was asked to do a job on Dinga's car, a job which puzzled him because he thought it was faked. Don't forget that our machine was abandoned for nearly twenty minutes, and that Tommy was puzzled over the absence of Dinga's chauffeur."</p>

<p>"Nom du nom!" choked Dumoulin.</p>

<p>He dragged at his hair with both hands, puffing out his cheeks and exploding with indignant snorts. Then he whirled on his heels and made a dart for the military truck.</p>

<p>"Ah-ha, sacre cochon noir!" he yelled. "I will have you for this, you black pig. I will teach you what the apaches of Paris have already learned—that it is not good to play tricks on old Dumoulin."</p>

<p>Dixon Hawke rushed after the excitable little man and pulled him back. His face was very grave, but his eyes were glittering as they only did when he was forcing himself to remain calm.</p>

<p>"Not yet, Jean!" he rapped. "We cannot prove that Dinga's servant fixed our machine so that we should be killed. I'm practically sure he did, but that is not proof enough. Also I do not want to scare Dinga at this moment."</p>

<p>"But, my friend—"</p>

<p>"Give me until tomorrow," went on the criminologist rapidly. "I tell you we are on the track of something much bigger than an attack on ourselves and the sacrifice of a few fowls. The black shadow of Voodoo lies over this land of sun and flowers."</p>

<p>Hawke held Dumoulin's arm firmly and gave him a little shake.</p>

<p>"I haven't forgotten that poor soldier we found near Eze. I haven't forgotten the postman of Antibes!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean," gasped the French detective very soberly, "that Dinga is perhaps responsible?"</p>

<p>Hawke slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can prove nothing as yet," he said crisply. "It is a very terrible thought, but we cannot catch our man unless we catch him red-handed, and tomorrow I hope we shall do that."</p>

<p>"You will give me the murderer of the soldier and the postman? Mon ami, but when you say such a thing I know it is to be so. Where are we to find this dog?"</p>

<p>"We shall find him," said Dixon Hawke quietly, "at the regatta in San Remo, and that is the reason why I want to get in touch with the chief of police—for there will be more than one arrest."</p>

<p>Dixon Hawke's mouth closed with an iron snap, and both Tommy and Dumoulin, who knew the great criminologist so well, realised that they would not get another word out of him. Hawke was not given to talking. Action was the keystone of his successful career.</p>

<p>"Bon !" shrugged Dumoulin. "Bon !"</p>

<h6 class="btt"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h6>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="dinga-swoops">Dinga Swoops</h3>

<p>The famous regatta at San Remo marked the real finish of the Riviera season. The little Italian casino town, just over the border from France, was decked out for the occasion, and crowds of people were gathered at the harbour.</p>

<p>Most of them were attracted by the promise of thrills in the chief event of the day—the race for the European speedboat record.</p>

<p>Dixon Hawke alone saw anything grim and terrible about that race, and he spent nearly an hour in telephone conversation with the San Remo police headquarters. For the rest of the night he sat in his chair, smoking pipe after pipe, his pale cheeks flushed with excitement.</p>

<p>Only something very big made Dixon Hawke act in that way.</p>

<p>The criminologist had gone for a swim the next morning when Tommy turned out early to test the Sunbeam. The machine had been quickly repaired, but the young fellow wanted to make sure that all was well before he drove his employer and Dumoulin to San Remo.</p>

<p>He drove the great car along the splendid road to Monte Carlo, testing his nerve with daring bursts of speed. Tommy knew that the only way he could recover from the shock of the previous day was to do a little stunting.</p>

<p>Tommy passed through the Principality, and went as far as Nice. After a quick lunch he started back again to pick up his passengers. They were to leave Mentone at one o'clock, in time to reach San Remo for the first event on the programme.</p>

<p>The car was running well, but there was still a little adjusting to be done, and Tommy stopped on a quiet stretch of the road near Cap d'Ail. Ten minutes' work would satisfy him that everything was mechanically perfect.</p>

<p>Tommy was so engrossed in his job that he did not see a big red machine purring along the Corniche from Monte Carlo. It was driven by a negro in smart livery, and was moving very slowly.</p>

<p>The car passed Tommy and pulled up a few yards in front of him. Although he knew that somebody had gone by, he did not look up until he had made the final adjustment. Then he closed the flap of the bonnet and turned round, wiping his hands on a lump of waste.</p>

<p>Young Burke got rather a shock when he saw the other machine. He recognised it as the one he had worked on at Dinga's place on the Grand Corniche.</p>

<p>As he stood there staring the door opened, and Dinga stepped out. He was perfectly dressed in frock coat and striped morning trousers, and a very shiny top hat was planted at an angle on the side of his head. The man's eyes glittered strangely as he surveyed the Sunbeam and its driver.</p>

<p>"You are in trouble?"' he boomed, and even in the open air the clash of gongs sounded in his voice.</p>

<p>"I'm not in trouble now," said Tommy grimly. "I was yesterday."</p>

<p>He wondered if Dinga recognised him, but the man gave no sign as he strutted over and halted a few feet away. His powerful arms dangled in front of him, and his shoulders were slightly bowed. Tommy sincerely wished that he had put a gun in his pocket before coming out, but he had not expected to meet with any trouble along the Corniche.</p>

<p>Dinga surveyed him slowly, his mysterious eyes holding something of the hypnotic glare of a snake poised to strike. He nodded his head several times, and muttered something in a Basutoland dialect which Tommy did not understand.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he asked, placing a long, black finger on the A.A. badge at the front of the bonnet.</p>

<p>Tommy turned to look. It was an automatic action on his part, the same as anybody would have done under the circumstances, and although he realised his error a second later, he was too late. Dinga acted the moment his back was turned.</p>

<p>An arm like a bar of iron whipped round his throat. A knee ground into the small of his back. He had a vision of the colourful cliffs which bordered the road as he was pulled back until his spine was almost cracking. When he tried to yell his voice was a mere gurgle.</p>

<p>Never had young Burke felt so helpless, and never had he experienced such strength in any man. Try as he might, he could not free himself from those terrible black arms which had closed about him.</p>

<p>He managed to drive one blow upwards at the hideously-working face which glared down into his own, but, although it was a heavy blow, Dinga merely grunted. He picked up Tommy with ease and carried him struggling to the car.</p>

<p>A moment later the door slammed and the big machine was again purring along the road to Mentone and the border, but this time at a higher speed.</p>

<p>Dinga held Tommy with one arm while he pulled down the padded seat, which opened out into a long couch. As the young fellow made another desperate attempt to free himself he was picked up and flung on his back. Dinga knelt over him, holding him down with his knees, and fastened straps about his wrists which he passed under the couch.</p>

<p>When Tommy again opened his mouth to yell a gag was thrust between his lips. He could do no more than gurgle faintly.</p>

<p>Dinga fixed his ankles with another strap, and then stood up. He positively gloated over his helpless victim, and somehow his vast body seemed to stretch. He was a great black shape, so tall that his bowed shoulders brushed the roof of the car.</p>

<p>His voice boomed out strange words in the language of his race. There was such venom in those clanging tones that Tommy felt his hair bristle. He struggled helplessly and then flopped back, his mind whirling as he puzzled over the strange outrage.</p>

<p>Noises came from outside. The big machine was passing through Mentone, and again Tommy made a frantic effort to free himself. He knew that he would actually be passing the villa where his employer was staying in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Hope grew when he remembered that they had to cross the border. The Italian frontier authorities might find him.</p>

<p>He heard the gears change down as they climbed the hill and bumped over the level crossing of the railway. The car slowed, and stopped for a French gendarme who had stepped out of his hut at the side of the road.</p>

<p>The man waved them on. So many cars were passing into Italy for the regatta that little attention was being paid to them. They purred up another stretch of hill, running under the lee of the gigantic cliffs which guard the frontier. Ahead was a barbed wire barrier mounted on wheeled trestles. Two Italian officials, carbines over their shoulders, stood in front of it.</p>

<p>Tommy's heart almost stopped beating. He could hear the men talking to the black chauffeur, and the rustle of papers being examined. The Italians were exchanging cheerful jokes with the negro. They seemed to know him well.</p>

<p>The barricade squeaked as it was wheeled back. Somebody tapped on the window of the car.</p>

<p>"Buon giorno, signor!"</p>

<p>"Buon giorno!" boomed Dinga in his mighty voice.</p>

<p>He gave a perfectly fiendish grin as he turned back to Tommy. The young fellow was dripping with perspiration as he tried to spit out the gag and yell for help, but it was too tightly held in place, and the great car was already over the border and climbing the final stretch of a narrow road which led into Ventimiglia and San Remo.</p>

<p>The only chance of rescue had failed. Dinga's car was so well known on the frontier that no examination was made of it, as is usual with residents who are well known to the authorities.</p>

<p>A short time later they ran through the crooked streets of Ventimiglia, and within another fifteen minutes were in the casino town where the famous regatta was to be held. The car stopped at the side of the harbour, where many other machines were already parked. The roar of powerful motors came to Tommy's ears, and he realised, with a curious feeling of hopelessness, that out there speedboats were shooting about over the blue water in preparation for the great race.</p>

<p>With an effort he turned his head and looked at Dinga. It was too gloomy behind those drawn blinds to see much of the man's face, but the whites of his eyes gleamed against their black background, and the perfect teeth flashed as he parted his lips in an ugly smile.</p>

<p>Tommy shuddered. Dinga, always queer enough, had apparently lost his European culture as a man throws off a cloak. He was native now, a native from Basutoland, primitive beyond words, wrapped up in the ugly superstitions of the dark wilds.</p>

<p>Dinga slowly unbuttoned his frock coat, and put his hand to his hip. Tommy saw the bone haft of a great knife, and in one blinding flash he knew the man's secret —the secret Dixon Hawke had suspected the previous day.</p>

<h3 class="chapternumber no_toc" id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h3>

<h3 class="chaptertitle" id="hawke-moves">Hawke Moves</h3>

<p>Back in Mentone, Dixon Hawke was waiting for the return of his assistant from the test run. He frowned anxiously, and glanced at his watch from time to time as the minutes passed. It was not like Tommy to be late when there was important work on hand.</p>

<p>"I hope nothing has happened to the lad," he said to Dumoulin. "I know it was good for him to drive so that his nerve would recover from yesterday, but at the same time I'm curiously worried."</p>

<p>Dumoulin shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Has not Tommee the nine lives of a cat?" he asked. "He will turn up like—what you call?—the bad egg."</p>

<p>"You mean the bad penny," grinned Hawke. "Well, I hope you're right, Jean, but it's almost time that we were away.''</p>

<p>He went out to the terrace, and watched the road for the missing car. Many machines passed, but there was no sign of the grey Sunbeam.</p>

<p>When Hawke saw the big red saloon of Dinga purr swiftly by he leaned out over the low wall and watched it. Then he began to pace up and down the terrace, his hands clasped anxiously behind him. Nearly half an hour passed, and then suddenly the criminologist clapped his hands to his head and gave a sharp exclamation.</p>

<p>"What a fool!" he gasped. "What a fool I was not to think of it!"</p>

<p>He rushed like a madman into the villa, almost knocking over Dumoulin in his hurry. A moment later he was at the telephone, calling the Mentone police, while the French detective danced round shooting anxious questions. He had never seen his friend so agitated.</p>

<p>"Yes—yes, at once!" Hawke was rapping out in French. "I tell you it is a matter of life or death. I am speaking from the villa of Inspector Dumoulin. Phone everywhere along the road between here and Nice."</p>

<p>He wiped a sudden perspiration from his forehead and turned to Dumoulin.</p>

<p>"Something terrible has happened, Jean," he declared. "Tommy wouldn't be late like this unless he was helpless —I know the lad too well. I'm trying to trace the car. Hallo!"</p>

<p>Dixon Hawke turned back to the phone, and as he listened to the official at the other end his face paled.</p>

<p>"Send it over at once!" he gasped. "Get the San Remo police, and tell them to make the raid which I spoke about to them yesterday. There is not a second to lose."</p>

<p>Hawke swayed as he clapped back the phone and caught Dumoulin's arm.</p>

<p>"The car's been found near Cap d'Ail—abandoned," he gasped. "Dinga passed half an hour ago in his red saloon. It's terrible, Jean—terrible! If we don't get to San Remo in time I shall never forgive myself. I never thought the man would dare to risk the frontier."</p>

<p>He began to hurry the French detective to the door.</p>

<p>"Run! Let's run down the road to Mentone, and we'll meet the car as they bring it up. That might save us a few minutes."</p>

<p>"But, mon ami " began Dumoulin.</p>

<p>His eyes bulged as he was lugged down the steps from the terrace and down the dusty road. Dumoulin was not accustomed to running at such a speed, and as he was dressed in patent leather shoes, he was soon in agony. Hawke dragged him on.</p>

<p>As they reached the head of the tramway lines they saw the Sunbeam coming towards them, driven by an agent in civilian clothes. Hawke waved his arms, and the man pulled up.</p>

<p>"M'sieu Hawke?" he asked.</p>

<p>The criminologist jumped into the machine as the officer politely stepped out. There was hardly time for Dumoulin to squeeze into the bucket seat by his friend's side before they were off.</p>

<p>Dumoulin was accustomed to speed. He was a driver with a reputation for daring, yet during the next few minutes he felt his hair bristle. The Sunbeam was roaring up that winding hill to the frontier at a level sixty miles an hour, a vast cloud of dust rolling up behind like a barrage.</p>

<p>They bounced high into the air as they flashed over the level crossing at the same speed. The gendarme on duty near the border hut came rushing out, but just as quickly rushed back again. His voice sounded in an indignant yell.</p>

<p>"Mon ami " began Dumoulin.</p>

<p>The Italian frontier was ahead. The barrier had just been wheeled aside to let another car pass, and Hawke toed the accelerator until they were doing eighty. Soldiers with uplifted carbines tried to bar the way, and then hopped back, escaping death by a fraction. The off mudguard caught the trestle barrier and flung it against the guardhouse. Yells of rage came from the Italians as they turned out in full force.</p>

<p>Rifles cracked. Bullets zipped after the speeding car. Dumoulin bounced in his seat and clutched at his hair, yelling for ten thousand bad cats to witness the madness of his British friend, but Hawke drove on, his lean face expressionless as he watched the road ahead.</p>

<p>"We've got to get there in time!" he roared.</p>

<p>The crooked streets of Ventimiglia approached and passed.</p>

<p>They were on the final stretch now, and the thick dust whirled about them in dense clouds. Dixon Hawke had become a perfect demon of speed.</p>

<p>"We've got to get there!" was the only thing he replied to his companion's protests.</p>

<p>They flashed into San Remo, ignoring the sign which gave the speed limit as fifteen kilometres an hour.</p>

<p>Another level crossing loomed up as they approached the harbour, and the gates were slowly closing. Dixon Hawke nipped through with an inch to spare, and finally took his toe off the accelerator when they were in danger of running into the harbour.</p>

<p>The car had hardly stopped when the criminologist jumped out and raced towards a big red saloon at the back of the car park.</p>

<p>From the harbour sounded the boom of exhausts as the great race for the speedboat championship of Europe was started. Hawke half-turned his head in that direction, and his eyes were wide with terror.</p>

<p>He dropped a hand to his pocket and pulled a gun, at the same time clutching at the handle of the car door and jerking it open. He gave a furious shout as he jerked up the weapon.</p>

<p>Twice the gun spat, the double report drowned by the terrific cheering of the crowd as the speedboats flashed round for the final lap.</p>

<p>Hardly anybody saw the massive form of Dinga as he pitched head first out of the car and sprawled in the dust, one huge, black paw gripping the haft of a knife. He lay there silently while Hawke slowly lowered his smoking gun.</p>

<p>"In time !" he gasped. "In time !"</p>

<p>Dumoulin came puffing up and caught him by the wrist, jerking the gun away smartly.</p>

<p>"My friend, are you mad?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Look!" rapped Hawke.</p>

<p>He pointed to the interior of the car at the bound figure of Tommy lying on the couch. Then he ducked into the machine, and quickly freed the straps which held his assistant.</p>

<p>"I don't know how I got here in time, Tommy lad," he said very quietly.</p>

<p>"I knew you would, guv," replied the young. fellow. "I guessed the whole of that madman's plans were known to you, and that you'd get him before he did anything."</p>

<p>"I'd made arrangements," agreed Hawke, nodding towards the Italian police who were gathered round, "but they would have waited for my order before they made the raid—and I almost failed to be here in time."</p>

<p>He jerked up his head as a terrific cheer announced the end of the great race. Hawke's face was grim.</p>

<p>"And that would have been the moment of your death, Tommy," he said. "When the King of Carnival passed Dinga's car at Cannes it was the moment of the Antibes postman's death; when that black horse beat Dumoulin's roan at Var a soldier died. I do not think I can imagine anything more ghastly."</p>

<p>He pointed down to the body of the negro.</p>

<p>"For the benefit of his disciples that man wore modern dress, but he should have been dressed in a grass skirt and have been decked out with bones. He's a pure Basutoland savage, and made human sacrifices to the Voodoo, as they still do in the dark forests."</p>

<p>"Mon dieu!" cried Dumoulin. "Do you mean those disciples of his knew that?"</p>

<p>Hawke shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't," he said. "They thought that a black chicken was the sacrifice, but Dinga went farther to satisfy himself. He simply drove his car along to the meeting-place, and kidnapped the first man he met. When he had finished he threw the body out."</p>

<p>"But why the Battle of Flowers, the race, the speed event ?"</p>

<p>"Because the worship of Voodoo calls for a huge crowd and some outside interest which works up the people to a high nervous state. In Africa they dance to the wild beating of drums, faster and faster, more and more furious, until the sheer snapping point is reached. Then the medicine-man makes the sacrifice."</p>

<p>Hawke wiped the perspiration from his forehead and drew in great gulps of the pure air.</p>

<p>"Voodoo," he breathed. "Pah! It almost makes me ill. We've stamped out an ugly growth down here, Dumoulin, and we managed it by sheer luck."</p>

<p>"Luck?" yelled Dumoulin. "Oui, perhaps it is luck that you have plenty of what you call grey matter in your napper?"</p>

<p>"Luck that you butted in and saved me, guv?" demanded Tommy. "I don't think !"</p>

<p>Dixon Hawke shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It was luck," he persisted. "If I hadn't seen those black cockerels I should never have suspected Dinga— and I only saw those birds because the wall round his place had not been completed."</p>
