		<p>Welcome to the online home of <span class="companyname">Tales of Murder Press, LLC</span>, an independent publisher of classic and out&#8208;of&#8208;print murder mystery and related novels and short stories.</p>

		<p>If it's a story that involves murder or violent, unnatural death in any component, or involves crime and detectives, whether professional or amateur, we publish it.</p>

		<p><span class="companyname">Tales of Murder Press</span> is the brainchild of writer &amp; editor Richard Cook. After 15+ years as a professional writer and editor in the corporate arena, he found his desire to use his writing and editing experience to tell better stories, and find an outlet for his own fiction and nonfiction storytelling interests. After drafting his own hardboiled PI novel, he realized a need to better understand the conventions of this genre and began researching past classics.</p>

		<p>Through this research, he discovered that the genre held more great works than those by greats and well&amp;#8208known authors like Dashiell Hammett and Agatha Christie. He discovered thousands of thrilling murder mystery and crime stories by lesser knowns like Ward Sterling, Ben Benson and others.</p>

		<p>Certainly known to rabid fans of the murder mystery genre, these authors are largely forgotten by the general reading public, even the average murder mystery fan. And while a few genre authors have reached the lofty realm of literature in the English 101 sense, most have been relegated to mere genre fiction status by academia.</p>

		<p>Yet, these novels and short stories are powerful, exciting works that deserve, in the modern Internet and ereader age, to be remembered and honored as literature.</p>

		<p>In an effort to save these works from historical obscurity, Tales of Murder Press was founded in 2013 to give voice once more to these authors, to introduce these great works to a new generation of murder mystery fans, to prove their literary merit, and to preserve them.</p>

		<p>Now, after nearly two years of research and development, Tales of Murder a Press is proud to announce the first stage of our long term plans with the launch of TalesofMurder.com.</p>

		<p>The site offers readers and fans a single location to find and enjoy these stories. It provides, free to all readers, short stories of up to 5,000 words. A free weekly email newsletter delivers these exciting stories to fans, giving them a constant stream of content to enjoy online or off. It will also provide longer works &mdash; between 7,000 and 10,000 words &mdash; exclusively to subscribers.</p>

		<p>These subscribers will recieve <em>THE RED FILE</em>, the weekly email digest.	Delivered to your inbox each Sunday morning, this free newsletter will have up to ten new stories ranging from ultra&amp;#8208short to very long, as well as news and interesting facts about the murder mystery genre, authors and their work, culled from the sister site and TalesofMurder.com blog site MurderWiki.com.</p>

<!-- 		<p>A paid email newsletter and online magazine, much like the classic detective and mystery periodicals of the early to mid&#820820th century, is also under development. Through this paid weekly publication, fans will gain access to longer works, from 10 &ndash; 15,000 words. Each issue will include everything from the free email newsletter as well as the longer works and at least one serialized novel.</p> -->

		<p>Full&amp;#8208length novels will occasionally be serialized on the site and will be published as ebooks, paperbacks and audiobooks available through the site and popular online retailers. Single edition and collections of short stories will also be available for purchase. Subscribers to <em>THE RED FILE</em> will have the opportunity to read these novels and short stories prior to public release and receive special discounts and limited editions.</p>

<!-- 		<p>Several podcasts are also under development. The first, called The MurderWiki Podcast, will be a weekly discussion of the genre, authors and important facts. It will include interviews with experts and authors.</p> -->

<!-- 		<p>The second, under the name Tales of Murder Podcast, harkens back to the days of radio dramas and will provide fans with dramatic readings of various short stories. Imagine a thrilling caper or murder mystery coming to life with voices and sound effects, perfect for listening to on your daily commute or with friends huddled around your iPod.</p> -->

<!-- 		<p>Finally, because so many of these stories, both short and long, are highly visual, as is the nature of all great storytelling, select works will be developed into short and feature&#8208length films for distribution via the Internet.</p> -->

		<p>Tales of Murder Press, and the forces behind it, are first and foremost fans of murder mystery fiction from cozies to noir and hardboiled, with amateur and professional sleuths, evil villains and desperate crooks. We seek to honor the men and women who penned these works while proving their literary worth and ensuring they do not pass into literary or historical obscurity.</p>

		<p>Join us on this quest by signing up for our free email newsletter or by simply reading and sharing these stories with your friends and other fans. <a href="http://www.talesofmurder.com/#openModal">Sign up</a> today and get a free copy of the thrilling novella <em>The Campaign for Vengence</em> by John Baer as our way of saying THANKS!</p>

		<h3>Copyright Status</h3>

		<p>All works—whether short stories or novels, whether provided free on the site and/or via email subscription, or paid content—is public domain or used by permission of the copyright holder. We acquire the material by purchasing back issues of old mystery and detective magazines and reformatting the stories for internet and ereader use. </p>

		<p>We never claim ownership or copyright on any material presented here unless otherwise expressly stated. We have, however, put a great deal of work into reformatting, cleaning and restyling the content. Many of the images, in particular, are redrawn by hand to ensure the highest quality. While legally you can copy and use most of the images (some are custom and therefore subject to our copyright; this will be noted) and stories, we ask that you respect our efforts and simply link to the story if you wish to share it.</p>

		<p>It is NEVER our intent to publish any work without give credit where credit is due or without permission.

		<h3>Censorship Policy</h3>

		<p>All stories are published on TalesofMurder.com for the entertainment of our site and product users. We seek to honor the original writers of the stories by publishing their works whole and complete, without changing the works in any way, except to correct any minor issues with grammar or punctuation. This means that occasionally a story may include language that, in today’s environment, may be seen as derogatory or inflammatory. We believe that changing this language to be more “politically correct” does a disservice to the writer and the story. It is, in our opinion, a form of censorship. Use of this language and our decision to keep it reflects the time in which the story was written and/or set. It does not reflect the opinions of TalesofMurder.com. We believe in free speech and free expression, without censorship. We believe in the rights of all people, regardless of race, creed, gender, etc.</p>

		<p>If you are offended by the language, please leave the site.</p>
