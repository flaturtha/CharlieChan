### The Girl
{: .chaptertitle}

The street was squalid, dirty.

On either side a row of rickety frame houses, leaning like drunken
sailors one upon the other, warned idle trespassers of the character of
the neighborhood. The few people who traversed it now in the autumn
twilight walked quickly and with many a furtive, sidewise glance, as
though in some ancient land of gnomes and ogres, where, behind every
wall, lurked an unknown horror.

That is, all but young Fleming Metcalf Knibbs. It is doubtful that
Knibbs could achieve the furtive if his life depended on it. He was one
of those straightforward chaps who insist that black is black, and, even
though a sizable check be the inducement, refuse to call it gray. Of
course, in reality, no check could possibly prove an inducement to young
Knibbs, as his private fortune was known to flirt with seven figures;
but the comparison is nonetheless illuminating on that account.

Nor was he without a sense of humor, or of balance: humor enough to
enjoy all phases of life, balance enough to realize that not in money
alone does one find happiness.

But his humor bordered on the romantic and adventurous, almost
indiscreetly so. He was given to prowling in little-frequented quarters,
and every now and again he would get himself in trouble, which he
enjoyed hugely.

Moving along the sordid thoroughfare, his ever-curious eyes taking in
its details, young Knibbs came at length to a house more rickety, if
possible, than the rest, whose door was at that moment slowly opening.
In the shadow he glimpsed white-stockinged ankles and slippers below a
dark skirt.

Knibbs was passing as the girl descended the steps. Her movements were
so softly gliding as to be almost ethereal, and, visualizing her as
emerging from a haze, he recalled a famous picture of a wood nymph
shrouded in twilight mist. At first her face was indistinct, then
suddenly he caught it, like a ray of light, and stood transfixed by its
strange charm.

And now he saw her quite unromantically catch the heel of one slipper on
the edge of a step and reach wildly for support. This impulsive movement
sent the other slipper flying through the air. It described a graceful
arc and landed on the sidewalk. The girl sat down heavily.

Fleming Knibbs congratulated himself on this heaven-sent opportunity to
acquaint himself with her, as he stooped and retrieved the itinerant
slipper. He turned, smiling pleasantly.

“Allow me,” he said, and fitted it to her unshod foot.

“Thank you.” Her voice was drowsy, as though it were early morning and
she had just arisen.

He looked at her sharply. “You’re not hurt?”

“Not at all,” she replied in the same monotone, getting to her feet. She
was an extremely pretty girl, Knibbs noted again, and wondered at
finding her in this contrasting environment. He fell in step beside her,
inquiring meanwhile if he might escort her to her destination.

“If you wish,” she conceded.

She was obviously tired, physically or mentally or both. Fleming’s
interest was intrigued.

And now they found themselves in a more populated section. The street
grew crooked. Situated in the tenderloin’s heart, it turned and twisted
convulsively, a veritable aorta of floating human derelicts writhing
toward the river and a cheap amusement park on its banks. But the girl
avoided the park, turning in an opposite direction. The crowd began to
thin out.

At the last corner, across from innumerable shadowy wharves,
and reveling in an unaccountable river stench, stood a wobbly fruit
stand illuminated by a single flaring gas jet. Dirty, flimsy wooden
baskets containing all manner of fruits and vegetables tipped their rims
partly toward the curb and partly toward the dark heavens, while here
and there a shadowy head of cabbage peeped out upon this dreary vista.
On a soap box by the stand, and directly under the uncertain light, sat
a mere boy, thin of limb and vicious of feature, hunched intently over a
Yiddish newspaper.

They passed this last outpost of the underworld, Fleming’s curiosity
growing apace. On the left stretched acres of slimy marshes, and beyond,
only faintly discernible in the growing darkness, the river. It was too
much for young Knibbs. He stopped in his tracks.

“What—?” he began, and then his mouth opened in surprise and
astonishment, and he concluded “—the devil!"

For a blunt automatic had been thrust against his ribs, and the girl in
the dark skirt and white slippers was talking to him in her soft, sleepy
drawl: “Be still, or I shall have to shoot you.”

Then deliberately she set about “frisking” him. Her slender fingers
plucked his scarfpin, his watch and at length found the inner pocket of
his coat and his wallet.

She was talking again. “Now, then, stand as you are.” She began backing
away. “I am watching you. If you move an inch—”
