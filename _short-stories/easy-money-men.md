_… It is told in Howard&#39;s best manner, with keen characterization, well-knit plot, excellent drama. ... And our hero discovers, as many have discovered before, that no man can cast off his past life as he discards an old garment. At an inopportune moment it will rise to confound him.—E. B._

{: .chaptertitle}

This story must be, in the very nature of things, something of a confession. It begins with the success of my play, &quot;Ladies of the Night&quot;— which was the producers&#39; title, not my own. Heaven forbid! The changed title, and what else the producers did to my play, made it successful. I was lucky enough to ride with them in that success.

But the story, after all, doesn&#39;t begin there. It begins long before that. And that&#39;s where the confession comes in. I dislike confessions, but in this case I see no other way of justifying myself. The circumstances, as you will see, were a bit unusual.

When I was very much younger than I am now, a series of events occurred that caused me to look at life through dark-colored glasses. Pessimism, I suppose, is a more or less natural counterpart of youth&#39;s ebullience. Rut in my case there was very little gaiety of spirits and a great deal of sadness. The result, at eighteen, was disastrous.

In the first place, I left the home of my uncle, who was also my guardian, in a fit of what I still consider righteous anger. I am old enough now to shrug and smile at it. But then I was furious. My uncle was an avaricious, miserly man, a religious hypocrite, and not at all the sort of person who should have been made the guardian of my father&#39;s son. For my father was totally unlike my uncle, and I greatly resembled him.

I was alone in the world, except for my uncle and my aunt. The latter was always very kind to me, except in her husband&#39;s presence. She was too timid to fight against his callous, dominating strength. On the death of my father, when I was fourteen, my mother having been dead for some years, Uncle John became my guardian. He was also given control of my father&#39;s estate, the value of which was about twenty thousand dollars. He exercised that control so carefully that I received nothing during the four years I lived in his house, beyond the barest necessities of life. I was poorly clad, poorly fed, except for the food Aunt Mary smuggled to me, and, I still think, badly treated.

I was graduated from the local high school just before my eighteenth birthday. I had hoped to go to college. But during my school-days my uncle&#39;s stinginess had made life almost intolerable. My friends were always entertaining me, asking me to share their little pleasures, and so forth. Having no pocket money, having to fight hard even for money with which to buy text-books, I could never return these favors. At that age a boy is apt to be high-spirited and proud. I deeply resented the fact that I was not given an allowance, however small. But my uncle would neither give me pocket money, from my father&#39;s estate, nor would he permit me to work. He was a rather important man in the town, and to have his nephew working would be a blow to his dignity.

Knowing that the same condition would continue if I went to college, I resolved not to go. My uncle was equally resolved that I should go. But I had made up my mind. On my eighteenth birthday, therefore, when my aunt gave me twenty dollars from her own secret savings, I bought a ticket to New York. The cost of the ticket was less than ten dollars. With the remainder of my money, I hoped to live until I could secure a job. When I had established myself, I decided that I would go to a well-known lawyer and consult him about my father&#39;s estate. At twenty-one it would be rightfully mine, but until I reached that age I could expect nothing from my uncle.

My clothing, as I have said, was of poor quality. No doubt I looked very much like a young hick, frightfully green. But I wasn&#39;t, exactly. I had read a great deal, and I was very observant. Also, I had been told often that I looked several years older than I was. No doubt life in my uncle&#39;s house had given me a certain air of maturity. On the train, thinking things over, I decided that I would give my age as twenty-one. This would help me in getting a job, I thought, at better wages than I could otherwise get.

The train butcher, from whom I bought a bar of chocolate for lunch, picked me as a green one right away. He tried to short-change me, but I caught him at it and caused him considerable embarrassment, to the amusement of my fellow-passengers.

\*\*\*

When I arrived at Grand Central station, I checked my bag. containing a few shirts and ties and socks, and started to walk across town. I had picked up the want-ad section of a New York paper and had glanced down the rooming-house ads. I had decided to live somewhere in the West Forties or Fifties, for I had already decided to become somehow connected with the theatre. Besides, theatrical rooming-houses were famous for their cheapness.

I had been to the city twice before, with my father, who had taken me to many shows, bought me everything I saw, and entertained me in great style. Then we had stopped at an excellent hotel. My father was one to do things in style. He was a gay, laughing, somewhat irresponsible man, but everybody liked him. He was my ideal. I have seen him give a dollar to a halfdrunk beggar, and when some one protested that the man was undeserving, he called him back and gave him another dollar.

&quot;Poor devil!&quot; he said. &quot;If he&#39;s undeserving, that makes it all the worse.&quot;

&quot;But he&#39;ll only spend it for drink!&quot; protested his companion.

&quot;Maybe not,&quot; said my father. &quot;Maybe the shock of finding someone generous enough to help him, in his condition, will sober him up and keep him sober.&quot;

My uncle called him irresponsible. But I know how utterly reliable he could be. When my mother was ill, for weeks and weeks he went without sleep, fighting for her life at her side. And once, when I broke my arm, he canceled important business engagements to be with me, to play with me. He cared nothing about money, for he made it easily. He was always doing things for other people.

Thinking of him, and of our visits to New York together, I walked west on Forty-second Street to Broadway. I paused before every theatre, considering my chances of employment there. I noticed that some of the well-dressed folk looked at my clothes. They were certainly out of place.

Turning down one of the Forties, in the direction of an advertised rooming-house, I saw a little tailor&#39;s shop. In the window were many unclaimed suits, offered for sale. I went in and looked them over.

After much dickering, I managed to buy a tailor-made tweed suit, that fitted me well, for six dollars. It was far from new, but it was made of excellent stuff and well-tailored. For another dollar the tailor threw in a cloth hat that went well with the suit. The clothing had been left by some temporarily broke actor who had been unable to pay the charges on it. I changed in the shop and sold the tailor my own outfit, after much argument, for one dollar. When I left him I carried myself with quite an air. The clothes did make a difference.

I am sure they made a difference to Mrs. Higgins, who conducted the rooming-house. She showed me her best rooms, which I could not afford, and I had to insist that I wanted something cheap. She led me, then, to the third-floor-back and I paid her one week&#39;s rent. I was supremely confident that my few remaining dollars would carry me over until I had found a job.

In that, I was lucky. One of the men in the house was the head usher at a theatre. I fell into conversation with him, and he gave me a job. It didn&#39;t pay much, but it was of the theatre, and it gave me much free time, nearly all of which I spent in the public library, reading plays and books about plays.

\*\*\*

It was lucky, too, when I met Moira Moore—the loveliest girl I had ever seen. She was just eighteen, and she came of a theatrical family. She had been on the stage since childhood, and, like myself, her parents were dead. She was having quite a struggle and existed, at this time, through Mrs. Higgins&#39; generosity. I think I fell in love with Moira at first sight. Whenever I could scrape a few dollars together, out of my earnings, I took her to dinner. Moira liked me, too, and we had many good times together, dreaming of the success that would come to us.

At about the same time, through Marshall, the head usher, with whom I often ate at the little off Broadway places, I fell in with a set of hangers-on of the theatre. Some of them sometimes acted, as a pretense of respectable activity ; but most of them did nothing. Yet they seemed invariably prosperous.

&quot;How do these fellows get by?&quot; I asked Marshall.

&quot;Oh, some of &#39;em are dips,&quot; he said. &quot;And some confidence men, or card sharps. Sort of genteel crooks— the Broadway kind.&quot;

I had always thought of crooks as ugly fellows with villainous faces, wearing masks, and hats pulled over their eyes. These men that I met with Marshall were not like that. If they were not handsome, they did not look especially disreputable. Once in a while I would hear that one of them had been arrested and sent up. But that did not happen often.

One of these men I took a liking to at once, because, superficially, he reminded me of my father. He was a happy, genial sort, and I saw him lend money to those less fortunate, with no hope of getting it back. His name, so he said, was Dan Blythe. I don&#39;t think that was his real name.

With Dan and some of the others, I met all sorts of Broadway people—the man who had married a wealthy widow twice his age and had been put out of her house by her clever lawyers, the woman who owned a famous gambling den, a man who controlled a number of opium joints frequented by the elite of drug users, and so on. I was, I suppose, thrilled by meeting them; there was a certain glamour about them, and it was my first glimpse of that sort of life. I was very careful, though, that Moira should not meet them. I never took her to the places they frequented.

Before long I had been accepted by Dan as a friend. I learned that he was a confidence man, at the top of his game. He had dabbled in counterfeiting and he had smuggled jewels into America. But he preferred the confidence game, and played it shrewdly.

About this time Moira caught a severe cold. She had just got an engagement, the first in a long time, that promised to be the beginning of a real success. But her cold became worse—Mrs. Higgins&#39; establishment was not properly heated or ventilated—and developed into pneumonia.

Dan Blythe had given me a hundred dollars for playing an apparently innocent part in one of his schemes, and, when Moira fell ill, I used this to engage a doctor and a nurse. But I could see that she was in for a long sickness. Some one else got her part in the new play, and Moira was alone and helpless. I talked to Dan about her.

Always generous, he offered to see that all her expenses were paid and that she was given the best of care. I could consider it a loan, and repay him any time in the future.

I had told him little about myself until then. But at this time I burst out with some protest at my uncle&#39;s greediness and made some reference to my father&#39;s estate. At Dan&#39;s questions, I told him the whole story, even admitting my true age.

&quot;It&#39;s up to us, my boy, he said at the conclusion, &quot;to collect from Uncle John.&quot;

&quot;If I only could!&quot; I cried.

My association with those who lived by theft had worked a change in my ethical code, a change of which I had hardly been aware, so subtly had it come about. And, besides, I thought, it is my money, not Uncle John&#39;s.

Dan began to plan. I saw, then, the inside workings of a clever confidence man&#39;s mind. He was to go to the town from which I had fled, representing himself to be a large factory man from New York. He would negotiate with my uncle for the purchase of some land he owned, offering him a thousand dollars for an option. The land was being held, as I knew, at twice its value, and my uncle would be pleased to think that he was getting the better of this large manufacturer.

&quot;When he gets the notion that he&#39;s playing me for a sucker,&quot; said Dan, &quot;I&#39;ll sink the old harpoon into him!&quot;

The plan, of course, was the simple, old and almost surefire one. Dan Blythe, the great manufacturer, would put up one thousand dollars for the option, agreeing to pay much more than the land was worth. But he would insist that he ought to have local backing, so that he would be insured of the community&#39;s loyalty to the enterprise. He would pay fifty thousand dollars for the land if twenty thousand were invested in his factory by my uncle or some other local people. Otherwise, he would select a factory site in a more hospitable community. Take it or leave it!

I could just see my uncle snatching at the chance. The firm Dan was supposed to represent was a large and well-known one. The thousand dollars in cash would establish him as a man of affairs. My uncle would discover, after buying twenty thousand dollars worth of utterly worthless stock, which Dan had printed for the purpose, that he had lost exactly nineteen thousand on the deal. And the large company would know no one who answered to Dan Blythe&#39;s description.

That was the scheme. I went into it all the way, giving Dan every bit of help I could. I was to receive half of what he got, more than a fair share, considering that he did all of the work.

&quot;Hasn&#39;t your uncle tried to locate you?&quot; Dan asked, during our conferences.

&quot;Not that I know of. Perhaps he did. But I left a note saying that I was going West. If he tried to find me, it has probably been out there.&quot;

\*\*\*

I am making no excuses for myself. But I do think I that it is fair to consider the circumstances—Moira&#39;s illness, my uncle&#39;s treatment of me, and Dan&#39;s kindness. The little struggle that my conscience put up didn&#39;t amount to much.

And it amounted to still less when the doctor reported to me that Moira was tubercular. That meant that she required a change of climate, freedom from worry, and the right sort of care.

&quot;Dan!&quot; I cried as soon as I could find him. &quot;Get that harpoon ready, and sink it quick!&quot;

Dan did. He was gone from New York only ten days. When he came back, he brought our spoils. Uncle John had been easy pickings.

With my share, I put Moira on the overland limited, in charge of a nurse, with a ticket for Arizona. I hated to see her go, I wanted to go with her, and I felt that I should never see her again. The money I was able to give her would take care of her until she regained her health. I told her it was from my father&#39;s estate.

&quot;I&#39;ve got to stay here and work, Moira,&quot; I told her. &quot;But when you&#39;re well, and I&#39;ve made a success, then, Moira dear—&quot;

She clung to me like a frightened child. But just before the train left, she brightened for a moment and became her courageous self.

&quot;I&#39;ll get well—for your sake,&quot; she promised me.

With Moira gone, my best friend was Dan Blythe. I was with him a good deal, and with his friends. I guess I developed a sort of Robin Hood complex—the idea of robbing the rich to help the poor. Our success in the case of my uncle inspired me to further efforts. Dan and I did nothing very bad, as I see it—I mean by that, we didn&#39;t rob any widows or orphans, and, so far as I know, we didn&#39;t cause anybody real pain or sorrow— but we did acquire easy money my matching our wits with others. Our best bets were the canny, the shrewd and the greedy. It&#39;s amazing how easy it is to trim a man who prides himself on being a cautious business man.

The years passed. Letters from Moira came regularly. Slowly she regained her health. She could never forget what I had done for her. When she was well enough, she was going back to the stage, to earn enough to repay me.

Meanwhile, I attempted to write plays. Those first efforts—how callow and silly they seem now! I was known as a would-be playwright. Dan saw to it that I was very little known as a confidence man. But I was one of the Broadway tribe, playing the easy money game, drifting.

My aunt had died, and my uncle had lost his fortune, including my own, through unwise investments. I got nothing from the estate except what Dan had helped me to get.

&quot;See?&quot; said Dan. &quot;You&#39;ve got to collect yours in this world, or it ain&#39;t collected. Lucky we went after that when we did, before the old boy bought that oil stock.&quot;

I suppose I could have prosecuted Uncle John for his misuse of my money. But I didn&#39;t care to bother with it. I had plenty, now, and, besides, some of my own activity might come to light in a court-room. I had the criminal&#39;s regard for courts and officers of the law.

Moira, confident that she had regained her health, returned to the stage, going into stock in San Francisco. I advised her against it, and, after two months in the foggy western city, she suffered a relapse and was forced to return to the desert. I would have gone to her then, but I was still eager to have a success to show her before I saw her again.

Finally, the Epsteins took my play. They changed it beyond recognition before they put it on, but it went over. It was a success from the start, and my royalties began to pour in. This, I discovered, was even easier money than the confidence game. Then and there, I quit that profession. Dan would have made me quit, anyway.

The Epsteins sold the film rights to my play to one of the biggest producers, who thereupon offered me a contract to write photoplays for him. I signed it and prepared to leave for Hollywood. I was sick of Broadway and the life I had been leading.

Being able to afford a servant, I took with me an ex-dip and forger by the name of Pinky Parsons. Pinky had suffered a paralytic stroke that made him incompetent in his graft and he was loyal beyond question. Before his criminal career had started, he had been a valet.

On the way to California, I stopped off for a day with Moira. This time she was truly recovering. And I thought that she was lovelier than ever. She was happier than I was over my success. Before I asked her to marry me, as I did presently, I told her what I had been doing. If I had anticipated the look of pain that crossed her face, I should not have told her. Yet I am glad that I did.

&quot;Never again, Jimmy?&quot; she asked. &quot;You&#39;ll never again do such things—even for my sake? Promise me!&quot;

I promised her solemnly. She agreed to marry me, just as soon as her doctors pronounced her cured.

&quot;And if that does not happen, dearest,&quot; she said, &quot;I shall not marry you, but I&#39;ll love you always.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t fear! You&#39;ll be well in a month!&quot; I assured her. &quot;And then I&#39;ll come back for you!&quot;

### Chapter 2
{: .chapternumber .no_toc}

### Hollywood
{: .chaptertitle}

These motion picture companies do things very well, except, as some one has cynically remarked, for making pictures. I was received as a celebrity and I became a guest of the producer himself. The company had located a charming house for me, high on a Beverly hill, and had leased it furnished. There, after a few days in the producer&#39;s home, I was installed with Pinky, a Japanese cook, and a chauffeur. One of the company&#39;s cars was placed at my disposal until I should select one for myself.

The homes of the wealthy, film stars and others, surrounded us. My house was not large or palatial, but it was a beautiful bit of Spanish architecture, and quite all that a playwright could want. I was happy in it, and I knew that Moira would love it.

&quot;Say,&quot; said Pinky one morning at breakfast, &quot;Dan had just oughta see the money there is here! Boy, wouldn&#39;t he gather in some, though! I&#39;ll say! But here&#39;s a funny one. You know that old guy that lives next door—the one I thought was a director maybe, &#39;cause he don&#39;t look like an actor?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; I nodded. &quot;What about him?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s a lawyer,&quot; said Pinky. &quot;And he used to be chief of police of Los Angeles. He was a devil at it, too, they say. He sent more men up than anybody— Say, ain&#39;t it funny—me livin&#39; next door to a chief of police?&quot;

And Pinky gave his little laugh, out of the corner of his mouth.

&quot;I&#39;ll bet a guy like that has a lot o&#39; enemies,&quot; he went on. &quot;He was sure hard when he was chief. I&#39;ve heard about him, all over the country. Some bird that he got sent up for a long stretch in the &#39;stir&#39; is gonna come out some day and pot him just for luck. I&#39;ll bet he don&#39;t sleep too easy. Huh?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t say anything, Pinky.&quot;

&quot;Well, why don&#39;t you?&quot; he asked, with the freedom of one who had known me &quot;when.&quot; I did not mind, for Pinky, in the presence of others, was the perfect valet. &quot;There&#39;s nothing to say,&quot; I told him.

&quot;Ain&#39;t there?&quot; he demanded. &quot;Say, I&#39;d just as soon you moved out of here and took another shack. Just s&#39;pose something happened to that old guy, ex-chief Farley. Just s&#39;pose! Where would we be at? Maybe some wise dick would get a line on me, see? Or on you. They never did get anything on you, &#39;cause Dan watched your hand like a daddy. But don&#39;t rest too easy. The New York dicks knew you was in the easy money, kid. Don&#39;t fool yourself. Now just s&#39;pose, for the sake of argument, that something happens to Farley. We&#39;re here, see? Right next door. There&#39;s gonna be a investigation. And where do we get off at ? Huh?&quot;

&quot;Nonsense!&quot; said I. &quot;You&#39;re talking through your brown derby, Pinky. You forget that I&#39;m an eminent playwright and scenarist. And you&#39;re my servant. Stow your worries.&quot;

&quot;Just the same, I don&#39;t like it, kid!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got the worry habit, Pinky. This is California, the land of the care-free. Eat, drink and be merry. And don&#39;t worry about an ex-chief of police.&quot;

I had to be at the studio rather early that day. I left Pinky still protesting, and was driven in the company&#39;s big car to the studio gates. There I went into conference with the star, her director and a continuity writer.

The star was a magnificent woman in her thirties. On the screen, doubtless, she looked younger. She had a certain free and easy charm, and she reminded me of the woman who ran the gambling den. I had known several like her, in fact. And presently, in her speech, I detected a use of words that signified familiarity with the underworld. Dan and I always fought shy of such earmarks, except in the company of our fellow-swindlers.

This woman, I thought, had been &quot;one of us.&quot; She had been a grifter.

Even after my years on Broadway, I still retained an air of youthfulness. It had helped me to put over one or two of our easy money schemes.

&quot;You are so very young!&quot; said the star when I was introduced. &quot;I had no idea—A mere boy, in fact!&quot; And she laughed, as if my youth were a great joke.

&quot;I understand that youth is what they want in this business,&quot; I said. The director, a fat boyish-looking fellow, chuckled at that.

&quot;Yes,&quot; nodded Mona de la Monte, &quot;that is true. But how can one so young know so much about—well, the wicked ways of the world?&quot;

&quot;I invented some of them,&quot; I smiled, in the manner of a Broadway wise-cracker.

\*\*\*

It was a little later that the continuity writer, a tall blond innocent who should have been out playing golf, made a suggestion as to how one of my characters should rob a safe in the film version. It was so unlike the real peterman&#39;s method, and so unreal, that I let out a protest.

&quot;Rats!&quot; I said. &quot;If you have to have the safe robbed, I&#39;ll show you how to do it. But for heaven&#39;s sake, don&#39;t thrust any more of that Jimmy Valentine bunk down the public throat. The real ways are just as dramatic.&quot;

&quot;Did you ever rob a safe?&quot; asked Mona, tantalizingly.

&quot;Nothing so crude,&quot; I laughed. &quot;No crib-cracking, no stick-up stuff, no badger game—nothing like that.&quot;

I said it lightly, but perhaps I placed a certain emphasis on &quot;badger game.&quot; I had thought, when I first saw Mona, that she would be a bird at that graft. She flushed, reached for a cigarette, lighted it, and coolly blew the smoke in my direction. There was that same tantalizing smile in her eyes. It was a mark of comradeship. She, the film star, and I, the playwright, were linked by our former professions. The director and the continuity man, both &quot;goofs,&quot; as we of Broadway should have called them, saw none of this. But Mona and I were en rapport.

By what stages she had reached stardom I did not know. Of course she was well qualified for the work. Her beauty was quite dazzling, in a rather hard, vampirical way. Perhaps, I thought, she badgered some producer into making a place for her. The opportunity once secured, she had easily won her public. I had read some publicity about her; she was supposed to be a Latin. She had been a dancer, well-known in Europe and South America. I doubted whether she had ever been out of the States. But that didn&#39;t matter.

Southern California, having attracted many people of wealth by reason of its climate and beauty, has always attracted those who prey on the wealthy. There are more clever criminals in this part of the country than anywhere else—mostly confidence men of one kind and another. Fake promoters, high-pressure salesmen of worthless stock, religious and medical quacks, each with a wealthy following, and so forth. It&#39;s a lucrative field.

\*\*\*

After our conference, Mona backing up all my suggestions, she asked me to lunch with her in her dressing-bungalow. Her pseudo-French maid served us, and I detected in the maid, as in Mona, the characteristics of one who knew a good deal about certain phases of life.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re assigned to my company,&quot; said Mona. &quot;I like you. We should be good pals.&quot;

&quot;I hope so,&quot; said I, politely.

&quot;Say, said Mona, &quot;whatever happened to Big Dick Harrison? The last I heard, they were trying to extradite him from Canada. Did they get him?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; I nodded. &quot;They tricked him into crossing over the Maine line. Dick&#39;s in Atlanta. It&#39;s been kept pretty dark.&quot;

&quot;Hell!&quot; she murmured. &quot;I liked Dick. He was a real man. I wonder if I can do anything for him.&quot;

&quot;He got five years,&quot; I told her. &quot;With good behavior and credits, he&#39;ll be out in a short while.&quot;

The man she mentioned was the so-called king of counterfeiters. Dan Blythe had known him well; I had met him once. He stood high in crookdom. He had perfected an organization that had branches in every sizable city. At a certain time all of these branches started &quot;shoving the queer.&quot; Dick received half of what was taken in; the rest was kept by the branch. It was such a wholesale scheme that, for a while, it was in a fair way to upset the whole United States currency. The Secret Service was confused by the widespread activity. Then one man was caught and squealed. But Dick&#39;s organization was such that one man could only implicate one other; he had borrowed this plan from a Red labor union that flourished before the war. As a result of his cleverness in this regard, he was not seriously implicated. Sure as the Secret Service was of his guilt, the jury was inclined to doubt the magnitude of his alleged crime. Finally, he was given five years for a lesser offense. It was rumored that Dick had salted away a large fortune.

&quot;It was here that they first caught him,&quot; said Mona. &quot;He came here to see me. Farley, who used to be chief, nabbed him. Dick got away, by forfeiting his bond, and went to Canada. I&#39;ll bet Farley had something to do with catching him there. He&#39;s a bloodhound.&quot;

&quot;So I&#39;ve heard,&quot; said I. &quot;I haven&#39;t met him, although my house is next door to his!&quot;

&quot;I wonder if they&#39;ll let Dick go, when he gets out. Or will they nab him on another charge?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. If he shows that he has money, they&#39;ll try to get him, of course.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m scheduled for a personal appearance tour,&quot; said Mona, frowning thoughtfully. &quot;And I&#39;m going to Atlanta! They&#39;ll let a picture star in anywhere—one nice thing about this game. I&#39;ll get to sec Dick. And if I can help it, there&#39;ll be no charge against him when he gets out. Will you help me?&quot;

&quot;Why—why, I don&#39;t know what I can do,&quot; I hesitated, remembering Moira. &quot;I&#39;m absolutely out of it now, Mona. Play-writing for me. And I&#39;m going to be married next month.&quot;

&quot;Good for you! I didn&#39;t mean that I wanted you to get involved in anything. But you&#39;re the only man I know that knows anything—about this kind of thing. I&#39;ll need your advice and your friendship.&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot; I nodded.

&quot;Good boy!&quot; Again she gave me that tantalizing smile. &quot;You know they call me a vamp. Aren&#39;t you a bit afraid of me?&quot;

&quot;Not a bit, Mona,&quot; I laughed. &quot;You can be a sister to me if you like, but that&#39;s all.&quot;

\*\*\*

Women of her type, wise in the ways of the world, accustomed to having men at their feet, are very quick to recognize disinterested friendship. When they know that they do not have to &quot;play&quot; a man, they can put aside their cultivated feminine wiles and be genuine and sincere.

In my own little office at the studio, where a stenographer chewed gum and read a late best-seller, awaiting my whim as to dictation, I found a letter.

It was from Dan Blythe. He wrote:

_Dear Kid: My brother Joe is in Dutch in Frisco. Time for me to be leaving the Big Town, anyway, and I&#39;m hurrying out to him. He&#39;s been on the square for a long time. I think they&#39;ve framed him. Anyway, I&#39;ll see what I can do. Afterwards, I&#39;ll run down to see you. Let me know—at the Frisco address below—if there&#39;s any reason why I shouldn&#39;t come. They don&#39;t know me there. Good luck._

I borrowed my stenographer&#39;s machine, and wrote him at once. I told him to come right on, that I&#39;d be delighted to see him and that I could put him up.

Then, an idea for a story having occurred to me while at lunch with Mona, I dictated a rough outline of it to the girl. She, obviously, didn&#39;t like it half as well as she did the best-seller. I took the outline and went home to think it over.

Pinky met me at the door.

&quot;Say,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;ve been keepin&#39; my eyes open. And there&#39;s been a funny old gink that looks like a hick walkin&#39; up and down here. He stopped and sized up this joint aplenty. Seemed like the place he was lookin&#39; for, all right. An&#39; I didn&#39;t like his looks. Say, I&#39;d just as soon you&#39;d move away from next door to the ex-chief.&quot;

&quot;Pinky, you give me a pain! Supposing an old gink does give the house the once-over. Maybe he likes its looks. Stow your worries. I&#39;m busy now, and I don&#39;t want to be disturbed.&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; said Pinky, the perfect valet. &quot;Would you like tea, sir?&quot;

&quot;Hell, no! Did I ever drink tea? Make me a pot of coffee!&quot;

I retired to my study to think out the details of my scenario.

### Chapter 3

### Neighbors and Friends
{: .chaptertitle}

Mona left a few days later, to be gone for several weeks, on her personal appearance tour. She went directly to Atlanta, and in a note to me she wrote that she had seen Dick and that they had planned for the future. As soon as she returned, the production of my play was to begin. Meanwhile, the continuity writer and the director and myself were busy with the adaptation. I knew little about the work, and my days were full.

Another letter from Dan Blythe assured me that he would be able to get his brother off, and that he would then visit me.

Moira was almost cured, her doctors told her. In a month or six weeks I could go to claim her and she would be able to live in California, if she avoided the sea-shore. Beverly Hills is high and dry.

Once or twice Pinky repeated his suggestion that I move. But I was so enamored of the house, and so wanted Moira to live in it, that I ignored his suggestion. He had again seen the &quot;funny old gink&quot; passing the place and looking it over. Several times I had passed ex-chief Farley with a neighborly nod, which he returned, and I believe my chauffeur had borrowed tools from his man. Farley was a grim, hard-faced man; from his appearance I could easily believe that he had been a human blood-hound so far as evil-doers were concerned.

I heard that he had become chief of police, temporarily giving up his profitable law practice, purely out of a desire to put a stop to crime. He had nearly succeeded, but as soon as he resigned and another man took his place, the department had lapsed again to its state of inefficiency. It was too small to cope with conditions in the fast-growing, far-spreading city. Driven by Farley, it had accomplished miracles. Without him, law-breakers waxed fat. I heard, too, that he had resigned as the result of a political quarrel. I wondered what his thoughts and feelings were.

My work kept me from thinking of these things. I was perhaps lulled into a sense of security. I put out of my mind all thought of my former career; it was as if those hectic Broadway nights had never been.

It was several weeks before Dan Blythe turned up. I found him at home when I got there late one afternoon. Mona had arrived the same day, but we had had no time to talk at the studio. She promised to come to my house that evening.

&quot;Hello, kid,&quot; Dan seized my hand. &quot;How goes it?&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; I said. And I told him of my work at the studio. &quot;And how about you?&quot;

&quot;So-so,&quot; he answered. &quot;I&#39;m all right, but I&#39;ve had some job getting Joe off. I got him freed on one count, but they may nab him again any time. He&#39;s been absolutely straight for over a year, but somebody wants him. I&#39;ve been talking with Pinky. He&#39;s been telling me about Farley, your neighbor.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Pinky&#39;s balmy on that subject!&quot; I said. &quot;Farley&#39;s all right. He isn&#39;t chief any more.&quot;

\*\*\*

&quot;Listen!&quot; said Dan. &quot;I learned a few things in Frisco. A big-new detective agency has been established—as big as Pinkerton&#39;s. It&#39;s a funny thing, too— they go after anybody at all, whether they&#39;re hired to do so or not. I understand they&#39;ve got all kinds of backing and their purpose is to round up every crook in California. They don&#39;t seem to operate outside the state yet, but they&#39;ve certainly got the dope on outsiders. They know all about me, for instance. Told Joe about me, in detail; every job I&#39;ve been on, nearly. Of course they&#39;d have a hard time getting enough evidence to convict, but they know me. They know I&#39;m here. Just let me try anything here, and they&#39;ll nab me. I don&#39;t doubt but that they know you, too, from your association with me. As near as I can estimate, they know all of us. And your neighbor, Farley, is the man at the head of it!&quot;

&quot;What!&quot; I cried.

&quot;Yes,&quot; nodded Dan. &quot;I had some job finding that out. But I learned it, and I&#39;m right. When he quit as chief, on account of politics, he organized this thing. Got a lot of business men to back him. They intend to stamp out swindles, because it&#39;s giving the place a bad name and interrupting the flow of tourists&#39; gold into their own coffers, see? Farley&#39;s the man at the helm. As I say, they know everybody—and all about &#39;em. As soon as a crook crosses the state line, they&#39;re after him. They don&#39;t bother much with the small-fry; they want us big boys that take the sucker money.&quot;

&quot;Then Pinky&#39;s hunch was right,&quot; I said. &quot;I should have moved.&quot;

&quot;Maybe not. Maybe you&#39;re better off right here, under Farley&#39;s nose. Now that you&#39;re wise, you can watch him. I didn&#39;t know he lived next door, or I wouldn&#39;t have come here. I&#39;ll get out. I&#39;ll be at a hotel—let you know which one in the morning.&quot;

&quot;But, Dan!&quot; I protested, as he rose. &quot;You can stay here. If you don&#39;t pull anything, what can they do?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to get you in bad, kid.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take a chance,&quot; said I. &quot;Stay here. Listen! Mona de la Monte, one of our stars, is coming over tonight. She&#39;s a friend of Big Dick Harrison. She saw him in Atlanta. He&#39;s due to get out soon, and—&quot;

&quot;He got out about a week ago,&quot; said Dan. &quot;I heard it in Frisco. They—Farley and his pack of hounds—know all about Big Click, too. Farley got him before, remember? He&#39;s going to get him again, if he can.

Dick had better watch his step. Who&#39;s the girl—his moll ?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s crazy about him, yes. You wait until she comes. I want you here when she talks about Dick. If he got out last week he may be in town now. I told Mona I&#39;d advise her if I could.&quot;

&quot;Lay off!&quot; cautioned Dan. &quot;You&#39;ve got to cut clean, or they&#39;ll get you mixed in. That&#39;s why I&#39;m beating it. You think about Moira.&quot;

&quot;I am,&quot; I said. &quot;But I&#39;m not going to let you leave now. You&#39;re staying for dinner. And I may need you when Mona comes. I&#39;m out of the graft, for always, but I&#39;m not gong to throw down a friend like you. Did Pinky tell you about the old chap he&#39;s seen around here?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Probably one of their men. May have been shadowing you.&quot;

&quot;That would be a dull job, all right,&quot; I laughed.

The Japanese announced dinner then, and Dan and I went in. Neither of us ate as heartily as was our custom.

\*\*\*

As we were sipping our coffee, Mona came. She kissed me on the cheek, catching me unexpectedly, and murmured &quot;Greetings, brother!&quot; with her usual smile. Then, seeing Dan, she nodded cordially.

&quot;I haven&#39;t met you,&quot; she said. &quot;But I know you. Dick has told me about you. You&#39;re Dan Blythe.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;m damned if you aren&#39;t Mary Blake!&quot; said Dan, staring at her. &quot;The &#39;within-the-law&#39; baby! I always wondered where you went. The nerve of you! A picture star, with your photograph everywhere!&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; smiled Mona. &quot;But my photographs now don&#39;t look like the ugly snaps the papers published when I disappeared. When they got Dick, I was out here, trying to break into pictures. You know when I left New York. Finally, I did break in. I went to Tahiti with a company. While I was gone they sent Dick to Atlanta. I was out of touch with everybody, and I hadn&#39;t been able to find him until Jimmy Leighton here turned up.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;d you know I was—?&quot; I began.

Mona smiled. &quot;Because you spotted me, brother. But, honest, you got me wrong. I never did the badger game, except once, and that time I had to. Well, Dick&#39;s here!&quot; she said. &quot;He&#39;s coming up here in an hour.&quot;

&quot;Hell!&quot; cried Dan. &quot;He can&#39;t come to this house. Lord, I&#39;ve just been telling Jimmy—&quot;

Pinky burst into the room, very much excited. But at sight of Mona he composed his features and said, in the colorless tone of a valet: &quot;I&#39;ve just seen that old man, sir, going into Farley&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; said I. &quot;Let me know when he comes out.&quot; And I dismissed him with a wave of my hand.

Dan hastened to explain to Mona what he had learned about Farley&#39;s organization.

&quot;It&#39;s dangerous for Dick to come here,&quot; he said. &quot;Dangerous for all of us. If Farley knows he has money salted away—&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve arranged that,&quot; said Mona. &quot;We&#39;re to be married at once. Then it will be announced that my salary has been greatly increased. It won&#39;t be, for my contract has some time to run. But the supposed increase will cover the money that I shall bank each week—Dick&#39;s money.&quot;

&quot;But don&#39;t you see?&quot; demanded Dan. &quot;It&#39;s tonight I&#39;m thinking about. Dick comes here, I&#39;m here, Pinky&#39;s here, you&#39;re here, Jimmy&#39;s here—suppose Farley knows all about us? What will he do?&quot;

&quot;What can he do?&quot; I countered. &quot;Dick&#39;s free, Mona is not wanted; and you and I are not wanted here. The best thing to do is to stay right here and sit tight. Mona&#39;s a well-known person, and I&#39;m respectable enough. Farley can&#39;t do a thing!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t like it,&quot; Dan shook his head. &#39;&#39;This Farley organization is a big thing, and a hard thing to buck.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not bucking it,&quot; I protested. &quot;We&#39;re as innocent as an orphan asylum. Sit tight!&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no way of reaching Dick now,&quot; said Mona. &quot;He&#39;s coming here. It wouldn&#39;t do for him to turn round and flee. No, we&#39;ll have to sit tight. I&#39;ll never forgive myself if this puts you in bad, Jimmy—&quot;

&quot;Forget it!&quot; I said. &quot;Farley won&#39;t trouble any of us.&quot; And I felt sure that he would not. I had become so thoroughly the respectable playwright that my old fear of the police had left me. I was all for law and order. Pinky came into the room again.

&quot;That old man is making a long call at Farley&#39;s,&quot; he said.

&quot;Yes, isn&#39;t he? A gentleman is calling soon. The name is Harrison. When he comes, show him in here.&quot; From his eyes I knew that Pinky knew it was Big Dick. But no expression crossed his face.

&quot;Very good, sir,&quot; he said.

### Chapter 4
{: .chapternumber .no_toc}

### Friends and Family Returns
{: .chaptertitle}

Dick came at the appointed time. He was happy to see Dan. They had been pals in what are referred to as &quot;the good old days,&quot; when everything seems to have been much better than it is now. When Dan told him of Farley&#39;s organization, Dick said that he had heard of it but had no idea of its scope.

&quot;Well,&quot; said Dan, morosely, &quot;I think our games are cooked in this fair state. From what I know—especially what I got next to in my brother&#39;s case—any of us that turns around and so much as looks crooked will get nabbed.&quot;

&quot;I should worry!&quot; observed Dick. &quot;I intend to quit, anyway. Mona and I are getting tied up tomorrow. We&#39;ve got enough—I mean, her salary is enough for both of us.&quot; He winked slyly.

&quot;Watch your step!&quot; cautioned Dan. &quot;Farley has ways of finding out just what they pay her. If she banks more than that, look out!&quot;

&quot;Dick,&quot; said Mona quickly, &quot;perhaps we&#39;d better not ! Let&#39;s not risk it. My salary is enough for us, really it is.&quot;

&quot;What breed of dog do you think I am?&quot; demanded Dick. &quot;Your salary&#39;s yours. This other money is ours.&quot;

Our general discussion of whys and wherefores, ways and means, went on for some time. Dan agreed to help Dick devise some way of using the money he had concealed at the time of his arrest. They agreed that they could put over some plan that would hold water.

&quot;If we can&#39;t,&quot; observed Dan, &quot;we&#39;d better retire. I&#39;ve beat better men than Farley in my day, and so have you!&quot; Pinky again stepped into the room. This time he was very far from the perfect servant.

&quot;Say!&quot; he cried. &quot;That old gink is comin&#39; here—with Farley! And I saw a bunch of men over at Farley&#39;s. I think they&#39;re surroundin&#39; the joint.&quot;

Everybody, for an instant, looked frightened.

As host, I felt that it was up to me to take charge.

&quot;All right!&quot; I said. &quot;Sit tight. He can&#39;t do a thing. Let me talk to him. Let him in, Pinky, if he asks for me. I&#39;ll talk to him out there.&quot; I indicated the hallway.

Presently the bell rang, and Pinky answered it. Farley and the other man were there. Farley asked to be let in; he wanted to see me. I stepped into the hall.

And then, instantly, I completely lost my self-assurance and my poise. The old man beside Farley was my Uncle John!

\*\*\*

&quot;I&#39;ve got you, you thief!&quot; he cried, as he saw me.

&quot;Hold your tongue!&quot; snapped Farley, whipping out a police pistol. &quot;Now, young man, I want to see your guests, too.&quot;

I hadn&#39;t even the calm left to demand that he produce a warrant. I let him force me back into my living-room and into the presence of my guests.

As soon as we stood before them, my uncle pointed out Dan Blythe.

&quot;There he is! There he is!&quot; he shrieked. &quot;That&#39;s the man that robbed me, with my ungrateful nephew&#39;s help! That&#39;s the man!&quot;

Dan was as surprised as I was by my uncle&#39;s appearance. So much water had flowed beneath the bridge since we had collected from Uncle John, that he did not at first recognize him. When he did he rose to his feet.

&quot;This man says you swindled him, Blythe!&quot; snapped Farley. &quot;You and his nephew! What have you to say for yourself ?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about,&quot; replied Dan. &quot;As a matter of fact, chief, I think the old fellow&#39;s out of his head. This is really what happened. This boy&#39;s father left him an estate worth about twenty thousand dollars. His uncle, there, who says I swindled him, was his guardian and executor of the estate. He misappropriated the funds and invested in worthless oil stock. When Mr. Leighton here—Mr. Leighton&#39;s the well- known playwright, chief—found that out he could have prosecuted his uncle. But he didn&#39;t. He let him go, out of pure kindness of his heart. And now the old fellow accuses the boy and myself of swindling him! He really must be out of his head. He&#39;s the swindler! Mr. Leighton has ample proof of that.&quot;

Farley looked from one to another of us, evidently somewhat impressed by Dan&#39;s words. He silenced my uncle roughly. He turned to me.

&quot;What have you to say ?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Mr. Blythe has stated the case exactly,&quot; I said. &quot;My uncle robbed me of my estate. By his ill-treatment he compelled me to leave his home. Then he lost my money in his stupid investments. When I was twenty- one, I engaged lawyers to look into it for me. I found out what had happened, and, rather than prosecute him, I let it drop.&quot;

&quot;You robbed me!&quot; squealed my uncle, thrusting a bony finger at Dan. &quot;You got me to invest in your factory! Twenty thousand dollars! You robbed me!&quot;

&quot;Do you deny what these men say?&quot; demanded Farley sternly. &quot;Did you or did you not defraud this boy of his estate? Answer me!&quot;

Uncle John had never possessed a surplus of courage. He cowered now.

&quot;What do you mean,&quot; went on Farley, &quot;coming to me to tell me this story when you stole this boy&#39;s money? Mr. Leighton says his lawyers have proof that you misappropriated his money! That&#39;s embezzlement! Do you hear that—embezzlement!&quot;

&quot;I lost his money, yes,&quot; nodded my uncle dully. &quot;But I didn&#39;t steal it. I lost it through an investment. I was only trying to increase it for him. But that man—&quot; pointing again at Dan—&quot;that man sold me stock in his factory.&quot;

&quot;I never had a factory,&quot; said Dan amiably.

&quot;I know you hadn&#39;t,&quot; answered my uncle. &quot;But you sold me stock in it. The stock was worthless! You swindler!&quot;

&quot;Keep still!&quot; Farley thrust him aside. &quot;I&#39;ll settle with you later. I&#39;ll have you understand that I don&#39;t trap crooks for other crooks. I think Blythe and Leighton are telling the truth, about you, if not about themselves. If they robbed you, I think they got only what they deserved. I&#39;m here on other business. Harrison, you&#39;re under arrest!&quot;

Mona cried out, but Farley ignored her. Dick looked calmly into the ex-chief&#39;s eyes.

&#39;&#39;You&#39;re bound to dog me, aren&#39;t you?&quot; he asked insolently. &quot;What&#39;s it for now—traffic violation?&quot;

&quot;There are several charges remaining against you. You should not have come back to California, Harrison. You knew I&#39;d get you.&quot;

&quot;But those charges—Why, there isn&#39;t a serious one among &#39;em. And you know as well as I do that you can&#39;t get evidence enough to convict. No jury is going to send me away again, after I&#39;ve done this stretch.&quot;

&quot;No?&quot; said Farley. &quot;As to that, we&#39;ll see. At your trial, you may remember, you stated under oath that you had no money except what you were known to nave in one bank account.&quot;

&quot;Well?&quot; asked Dick.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve found where you hid the rest!&quot; snapped Farley. &quot;And Jones has confessed.&quot;

\*\*\*

At those words, Harrison visibly wilted. For a bit, there was a tense silence, during which no one moved. We all realized, I think, that Dick was indeed caught. I glanced at Mona; certainly her face was more tragic than in any moment of her pictures.

When I say no one moved, I forgot Uncle John. When I looked away from Mona, I saw that he had stepped behind Farley. In his upraised hand was a dagger that he had insanely stripped from the wall. In an instant he would have sunk the blade into Farley&#39;s back.

&quot;You won&#39;t help me, eh?&quot; he murmured madly. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll—&quot;

I could not have moved, by any act of will. Nor could Dan.

But I saw Dick Harrison, covered though he was by Farley&#39;s pistol, leap at Uncle John. Farley, thinking it an attack upon himself, fired. But Dick did not stop. He caught Uncle John&#39;s upraised hand and twisted the dagger from it. The knife fell to the floor. Farley, swinging round, saw this brief bit of action and realized that Dick had saved his life.

My uncle had been thrown against the wall by the force of Dick&#39;s weight. He remained there. And Dick, turning to face Farley, sank to his knees, with blood spurting from him.

Farley caught him in his arms.

&quot;You saved my life!&quot; he said, somewhat awed.

&quot;&#39;S all right, chief!&quot; Dick grinned weakly. &quot;I forgot it was you he was after.&quot;

Then he lost consciousness, and Mona gathered him into her arms.

<h6 class="btt"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h6>

### Chapter 5
{: .chapternumber .no_toc}

### An Agreement
{: .chaptertitle}

I could never have straightened out this tangle with out Moira&#39;s help. She arrived early the next morning.

&quot;Jimmy, dear,&quot; she cried as I caught her in my arms. &quot;They told me I was absolutely well and I just couldn&#39;t wait to wire you to come, and so I came to you, and oh! I&#39;m so happy to.be here and what a wonderful house this is!&quot;

Of course, I was delighted to see her—as gay and well as when I had first met her. But her arrival was rather unpropitious. I had to see Farley within a few minutes. Dick had been taken to a hospital the night before, Mona going along with him. I had put up Dan. And Farley had taken Uncle John home with him.

&quot;If you&#39;ll promise me to do nothing at all until I&#39;ve talked with you,&quot; he had said, &quot;I&#39;ll promise you the same.&quot;

On that we had shaken hands, and Farley had gone.

&quot;Don&#39;t expect any decency from that old bird,&quot; Dan had commented. &quot;He&#39;d send up his own mother if he felt like it!&quot;

And now, with Moira here, I would have to tell her all that had happened. I did, briefly and simply.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t throw down my friends, Moira,&quot; I concluded, &quot;even though I had quit the game.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she promptly agreed. &quot;No, that wouldn&#39;t be like you. All right, Jimmy, run along and talk to your Mr. Farley. I&#39;ll walk through your lovely garden.&quot;

She went outdoors with me, and walked at my side to the hedge that separated my place from the ex-chief&#39;s. At a gate there Farley met us.

And thus, unintentionally, Moira became the third member of our conference. Farley, having met her and having asked me if she knew what had happened, would not have it otherwise.

&quot;Now,&quot; said the policeman, &quot;I&#39;ve had a report from the hospital. Harrison is not badly wounded, and he&#39;ll soon recover. I can&#39;t discount the fact that he saved my life and that I shot him while he was doing so. Your uncle is partly demented from his worries about money. He&#39;s been here for some time, and ever since you moved next door he&#39;s spied on you. When Blythe appeared he came to me and demanded that I arrest you both. I was more interested in Harrison.

&quot;The man saved my life. But I can&#39;t take that into consideration, at all, unless he voluntarily restores the money that he stole. He&#39;s got to give it up. Perhaps he&#39;s been punished enough, but I swore never to let him get away with that money and I don&#39;t intend to!&quot;

&quot;And if he does give it up—you won&#39;t prosecute him?&quot; I asked.

&quot;How can I?&quot; growled Farley. &quot;He saved my life! And I&#39;m pretty sure the police won&#39;t! They don&#39;t prosecute anybody any more!&quot;

I led him on to a further discussion of the case. What did he mean to do with Dan, and Dan&#39;s brother, with my uncle and myself? If Dick gave up the money and attempted no new swindle, would he go free?

Farley countered with questions of his own. So shrewd was his cross-examination that, before I knew it, I had partly given myself away. I shrugged and told him my story, much as I have told it here. It was then that Moira broke in.

&quot;But he did it for me!&quot; she said. And she said much more—so eulogistic that I should blush to put it down.

&quot;Well,&quot; said the old chief, slowly, and with the suggestion of a smile, &quot;I think you&#39;re worth it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll see that my uncle is provided for,&quot; I said, &quot;not because I have any love for him, but because he is my uncle.&quot;

&quot;Good!&quot; Farley nodded. &quot;Very well, then. If Harrison surrenders the money, he&#39;ll go free, on the condition that he commits no crime in California. Your friend Blythe on the same condition, and likewise his brother—my San Francisco office was too zealous in that case, anyway. As for you, I place you in the custody of this young lady!&quot;

And there I have happily remained.

Although Dick cursed when compelled to give up his ill-gotten gains, he was soon reconciled to it. Mona&#39;s salary was large enough for both. And, in the past, Dick had squandered thousands on her.

But Pinky will never outgrow his suspicion of Farley.

&quot;I&#39;d just as soon you&#39;d move outa this shack,&quot; he often says. &quot;Me, livin&#39; next door to a chief of police! It ain&#39;t right!&quot;
