A robber whose methods are new to Chicago's criminal annals recently robbed passengers of the Chicago-Washington-New York Express, of money and jewelry said to be worth not less than three thousand dollars.

The train was leaving the Sixty-third Street Station, in Chicago, when the bandit appeared in the observation car, wearing a silk handkerchief for a mask and waving a pistol threateningly as he went through the pockets of the passengers. After he had searched them, he pulled the bell cord and climbed over the rear platform of the train. Taking to a waiting automobile, he made good his escape.

Immediately after the details of the robbery became known, the police began a search for the highwayman. The only clews which they had to work on were a rather meager description and the knowledge that the man had evident training in courtesy and a gift for interesting conversation.

The passengers stated that they were requested "please" to put up their hands, also that the robber had made no attempt to molest any of the women in the train, even going so far to ask them to step into the next train so that they would not be frightened.

As he relieved each of the passengers whom he searched, he said: "Thank you very much. I needed some money. Next!"
