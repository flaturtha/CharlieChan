### Chapter 1

### Broadcast From Limbo
{: .chaptertitle}

I stood on the top deck of a small Coast Guard cutter watching the jagged line of lower Manhattan rapidly falling astern. The early afternoon of a Spring day threw queer shadows across the towering skyscrapers, and there was just enough left of Winter's dying breath to churn  the bay into white caps of froth and cause my ears to snuggle appreciatively in the turned-up collar of my camel's hair coat.

I flipped my cigarette into the water and walked toward the bow where Harvey had set down my recording equipment. The newspaper boys were huddled together exchanging old stories for new and casting condescending glances at the press photographers loaded down with their cameras and paraphernalia.

The uniformed Customs men were down below going over their papers and getting them in order, so I guess I was the only one in the bunch on the cutter who kept a watchful eye out for the trim shape of the giant liner we were to meet with me it was always a thrill to spot one of the luxury trade ships come into sight off the bow, though I'd been doing the same thing for over six months.

I looked around for my assistant but as usual Harvey was somewhere else. Although he hadn't been with me very long, he had the knack of getting interviews for me. I didn't have a chance to lay hands on him just then because a guy strolled over to where I was standing.

Pointing to my stuff on the deck, he said: "That a wire recorder you have?"

"Uh-uh," I replied. "Tape. I'll take it over wire anytime. It's easier to work with."

He was a well-built man with square shoulders and a round pleasant face. His prominent features were chisel sharp and his gray eyes were two points of searching light.

"My name is Barkley," he said as he stuck out his hand. "Jeff Barkley."

"Mine is Hugh Crandall."

"Oh," he cut in, his face beaming, "the radio interviewer, huh?"

I nodded and let him talk.

"Say, I've heard your program over WZYH."

I smiled easily. "A fan maybe?"

"Yeah, yeah. Say that's a great show you've got, Hugh."

"Thanks, pal."

"You get all the celebrities, don't you?"

"That's my job," I told him. "That's why the station pays me and that's why guys like you listen in, I guess."

He grinned but didn't say anything. I felt a little bored but what the hell, a guy in my business never lets a chance to blow his horn get by.

"I meet all the big ships," I went on. "Coming and going --- it doesn't make any difference; if there's a celeb aboard I shove a mike in his face and let nature take its course. What do you do?"

"Oh, my game is rather prosaic," he said "I'm with the National Art Museum."

"Yeah? So what's prosaic about that?"

He grinned.

"I have my moments. I'm meeting an old guy with a valuable painting now. Say," he said as if he just got a thought, "maybe you'd like to do an interview with him. I can arrange it."

He took a look at my blank face and went on, "He found this painting in an abandoned cave and he --- "

He never finished the sentence because just then somebody yelled, "There she is!"

<hr class="sec-break" />

Everybody turned and looked at the *Queen Elizabeth* off the starboard bow. When I glanced around again the guy from the art museum was gone, his broad back making like a dissatisfied sponsor as he strode briskly astern.

I watched as we drew close to the big ship and somehow I couldn't suppress a vague, uneasy feeling.

By the time Harvey joined me we were bobbing up and down alongside the *Queen Elizabeth*. Busy deck-hands fastened a portable runway between our little cork and the towering Queen of the Seas and the trek to her warm interior began.

Harvey picked up the heavy power pack we used for our source of electricity and I grabbed the recorder.

"Wow," he said, "look at that mob!"

High above me the black and white side of the huge ship towered like a glistening wall with a thousand eyes. I could see the countless gleaming portholes jammed with curious, grinning faces and the decks lined with people busy being just people, their hands making happy gestures in the air as if each one was all we would notice.

"Some mob, huh, Hugh?" said Harvey again, and he started up the gangway.

I should have been bored stiff but I couldn't help it --- I still got a kick out of it. We set up on the verandah deck with photographers and reporters all around us, and Harvey went out and gathered in the celebs for my program.

It was pretty easy because, as I said, we did it on tape and then later back at the studio we edited and cut out what we didn't want and put it on the air the following day. We usually had two hours before the ship docked and started discharging passengers, so we went right to work and in an hour and a half we had cut nearly all the interviews I could use.

"Hey, Harvey," I yelled, "get me one more."

He came over with a copy of the passenger list and pointed to a name I didn't know.

"I've tried to get this baby, Hugh," he croaked, "but he wants us to go down to his cabin; he won't come up."

"To hell with him," I started to say, then read the name out loud. "Professor Szabo. Who's that? What's good about him?"

Harvey's white, unexpressive face registered surprise.

"What kind of an intellectual are you? That's the old guy who discovered the painting in an abandoned cave somewhere in the Balkans."

"Oh," I said and I suddenly remembered the museum fellow on the cutter.

"Good interview," I clipped. "Get him."

Harvey looked a little anxious.

"I just told you, Hugh; I called him on the ship's phone and he says he won't come up. If you want an interview, you'll have to --- "

"Have to go down to his cabin," I finished gruffly. "Okay, let's go. Might be worth it. Different, huh?"

Harvey looked relieved and I was suddenly glad that this was the last interview for the day. We lugged our equipment down to Cabin B-7 and rapped on the door. It opened inward, and my eyes bulged outward like the convex ends of somebody's binoculars.

In one glance I knew that she was just about the most gorgeous gal I'd ever seen --- and in my business, brother, I've seen!

"Ah," she breathed out of luscious red lips, "you za rad-io man, yes?"

Her lovely, low-pitched voice had the soft Stradavarian tone of a muted G string and her Balkan accent played upon it with utter charm.

"Yes," I muttered a little unsteadily, "I'm the radio man," and so we went inside.

Her long blonde hair was like golden blossoms in the sun. Her hand was soft and warm in my palm.

"It is my grandfather you want, yes?" I nodded and site said, "I am Salizar Szabo. It is, I theenk, Sally you call it, yes?"

Her smile lit up the cabin.

"Okay, Sally," I grinned. "I'm Hugh Crandall."

And I introduced my assistant who was already busy setting up our equipment.

<hr class="sec-break" />

The old professor came forward with extended hand, and said in a thick accent that he was flattered by the idea of a radio interview in "this so great, so wonderful country."

He told me that he had been at the university for years but had fallen out of favor with the state heads when the new government came to power in his country.

"Tell me about the painting, Professor Szabo," I asked. "How did you find it? How much is it worth? You know --- er --- maybe some stories about its history?"

He wasn't looking at me but at Harvey busy connecting the portable recorder, and there was a perplexed expression on the old man's face.

"You see," I hastened to explain, "we talk about the interview first and in that way we'll make it interesting when we are ready to record it."

"Ah yes," he said, "I see."

Sally bent forward and touched the old gent lightly on the arm.

"I will be back later, Grandpapa.

"She smiled and walked from the cabin, leaving me with a sudden uncontrollable feeling of loneliness.

I turned to the professor.

"Perhaps we can see the painting, sir? You know, describe it for the radio audience."

"But, of course," he bowed. "It is a pleasure, no?"

He extracted a metal tube about twelve inches long from a suitcase at the foot of the bed and held it fondly between his palms, his eyes glittering with a light that was more than just proud ownership and appreciation of art. He slipped the rolledup canvas into his hand and spread it out for me to see.

Now I might just as well tell you right now that I'm no connoisseur of art. Art with me is something else, if you follow my line of thought, and what the old guy held before me didn't look at all like that. What he was showing me looked more like the stained glass window in the corner church.

"W-what does it depict, Professor?"

He started to answer but his open mouth only made queer unintelligible sounds, his filmy old eyes fixed on my face as if I were the devil himself.

"What's the matter, Professor? What is it?"

He didn't seem to hear. Something behind me made a soft metallic sound like a door opening and I heard Harvey's hoarse voice whisper: "Look out!"

I started to whirl around but before I was anywhere near completing the turn, something incredibly hard thudded into my head just below my right ear. As I went down on my stomach I saw Professor Szabo's green eyes framed in a white, bewildered face of fear.

And that was the last thing I saw because the pitch blackness of cold midnight suddenly came out of nowhere and swirled around me. The floor must have been hard underneath my body, but I didn't feel it. I was covered with the soft, enveloping blanket of complete unconsciousness ... .

I came to with my nose pressing into the maroon-colored carpet and my ears filled with the nerve-wracking noise of a billion electric trip-hammers going full blast. I pulled myself wearily to my knees. As I moved, an agonizing pain shot through my head, and my exploring fingers told me by the size of the lump behind my ear that I was lucky I didn't have a fractured skull.

I looked up. The old professor was just like I'd last seen him, except that he was sitting in the chair instead of standing and the look of fear in his face was gone. In its place was the blank expression I'd seen many times on the faces of some of my buddies on Omaha Beach after a half dozen rounds of red-hot Nazi lead had poured into their bellies.

Professor Szabo's staring old eyes were watching me with a steady gaze. Only he couldn't see me --- not with that little round hole in the middle of his white forehead!

### Chapter 2
{: .chapternumber .no_toc}

### Sweet and Deadly
{: .chaptertitle}

I got up, staggered backwards, and tripped over something on the floor. It was Harvey. The cabin was lousy with bodies, but this one moaned and sat up.

"Damn," he gritted, "my head!"

And I spotted the raw skin on his forehead, which made two of us big boosters for a couple of fistfuls of aspirin.

"You okay, kid?" I wheezed.

He felt all over himself and muttered, "Yes, yes, I guess so."

"The old guy's gone, Harvey. I wonder if --- " I stopped yapping and walked over and picked up the metal tube off the carpet I could see the rolled-up painting still inside. "What the hell's it all about?"

Harvey shook his head at me and looked scared.

"Let's get out of here, Hugh."

All of a sudden I got all reporter.

"Yipes!" I yelled. "What a scoop! Come on, let's get off this tub and put this on the air. We'll scoop the AP and all the rest on this. Come on, boy, let's go!"

I felt kind of squeamish about leaving that nice old guy in there like that, but what the hell, I'm paid to do interviews, and this time I'd had an interview with death. This I had to get on the air fast.

We lugged our equipment out of there and up on deck just as the first passengers started down the gangplank. We jostled along with them and I started getting me a nice case of guilt complex. I turned and looked back at the ship. I could see a lot of faces staring at me but the one I noticed most was one I knew --- the hard-bitten, prominent features of Jeff Barkley, the guy from the Art Museum.

He was watching me from the promenade deck, a strange intent look on his face which I promptly matched because, now that I thought of it, how come he hadn't shown at the old man's cabin?

Twenty minutes later I set the recorder down on my desk at WZYH and told Harvey to return the power pack to the engineering department.

"Better stop in and have a doc look at that head, too, kid," I called out.

"Yeah," he mumbled, "but how about the tape?"

"Come on back in a couple of hours and we'll edit and cut it for tomorrow's air time."

He seemed hesitant. "Are you sure it's okay? Leaving like that, I mean? How about the police?"

"Let me worry about it, huh?"

Then I decided to play it safe. Maybe he had something there.

"I'll check with Schreiber," I snapped.

I watched Harvey close the door behind him. The guy seemed a little groggy. That was natural enough; I guess he had a noggin full of noise, too. He'd told me about the big lug who had conked us both in Professor Szabo's cabin, but from the way he'd described him, it could have been almost anybody on the ship. Anyhow, one thing I was sure of --- the monkey hit like Joe Louis!

I picked up the phone and asked for Norman Schreiber, our V.P. in charge of Public Events, and that's when the door to my office burst open and he came charging in. Norm was a little guy with big ideas, always on the go whether it meant anything or not. He got to be known as the boy with a dynamo under his shirt so he always tried to act the part. Maybe that's how he got to be V.P.

"Okay, Hugh boy, okay, so what did you get that's interesting this trip?"

"Oh, brother!" I moaned. "Wait till you hear!"

"Names, names, Hugh," he clipped off. "That's what I want on this station. Celebs, kid, celebs."

"Take it easy, Norm," I said. "Names I got you, but that ain't all."

"So what's more important?"

<hr class="sec-break" />

So I told him. I reeled off about the painting, the clout on the head and the little old dead guy in Cabin B-7. I'd half expected him to explode like a human atom, but he fooled me. He sank down in the chair next to my desk looking like a deflated plastic balloon.

"Hugh," he spat, "you must be nuts! Why didn't you wait for the police?"

I shrugged and he kept right on going.

"You're a damned fool, Hugh. What do you expect to do --- interviews behind bars, yet? Well, let me tell you something, boy, you're on your own and don't look for me to help you. I'm not getting the station mixed up in something like this."

I tried to explain my reasons --- the big scoop I expected to get. It sounded as lame as a three-legged horse.

He snapped his fingers at me with disgust.

"That's why you'll always be just an announcer, boy."

"All right, all right," I yielded in a touchy tone. "I'll call Homicide and spill it, but there goes my scoop."

"To hell with that. Murder is murder!"

The telephone rang sharply and I reached for it, but the V.P. beat me to it as if it were his. I didn't hear what was said on the other end but from the way Norm's face changed color like a chameleon on an Indian blanket I knew something was up.

He just glared at me and mouthed monosyllabic phrases into the mouthpiece. Then he banged the receiver down angrily.

"You sure as hell aren't going on the air, boy. That was Lieutenant Stewart of Homicide. You're a dead duck, baby."

"What?"

"That old professor's dead all right --- and you know that painting we're talking about?"

"Yeah?"

"It's just turned into a five-and-ten cent store calendar ... . Professor Szabo's painting is missing!"

The V.P. stalked out of there and left me sitting in my own private leper colony. All right, so I'd made a mistake. What the hell --- I wasn't the first reporter to do that.

I got Lt. Stewart on the telephone and explained, or tried to. If I thought that Norman Schreiber was hot, brother, that Homicide boy had 640 degrees Fahrenheit under the collar of his blue serge. He cussed me from here to there and back again for obstructing justice, and threatened to come up and get me if I didn't come right down.

I promised to be there and I would have been, too, if I hadn't gotten the bright idea that I'd better tape my murder story while I still had the chance. I plugged the recorder in, palmed the mike and switched it on. The damned thing wouldn't work.

I clicked the two snaps that held the back-piece in place and slipped the top off. I guess I must have stared at what I saw for a full two minutes with an amazed expression on my face and a sick, low-down feeling in the pit of my stomach!

No wonder it wouldn't work. Something was jammed in between the two pulleys. It was a thick piece of rolled-up canvas that I'd seen before, and my trembling fingers didn't have to take it out and unroll it to let me know that I was looking at the old professor's missing painting!

I took my bottle of bourbon out of the desk drawer and set it down in front of me, and after I'd lowered it a good three inches I made up my mind. This kind of opportunity I couldn't miss.

I took the painting down to Mailing, stuck it in a corrugated tube and mailed it to myself. Then I locked the tape recording machine in my closet and went out and grabbed a taxi.

When I got to Police Headquarters, Lt. Stewart laid me out like a soggy blanket. The tongue-lashing he administered was reminiscent of my old man behind the wood shed. I wondered what he'd have said if he knew that I had the painting and wasn't telling.

"There's a ten-thousand dollar painting missing, boy, and a guy's been killed. You'd better stick around."

"Why don't you chain me down if you think I did it?" I yelled hotly.

"Okay, okay," growled the detective. "Get the hell out of here!"His long face had a hangdog look.

"If I didn't know you so well," he thundered, "I'd cool you off for a spell for the mess you're in."

So all I had to do now was go home and wait, because I knew that the killer would come looking for me and the tape recorder.

It was dark when I got back to my small apartment. I didn't have so long to stick around at that. The door buzzer went off like a three-alarm fire and if I jumped three and a half feet, I had only myself to blame.

It was the gorgeous Szabo kid from the ship. She eased in and closed the door behind her as though she'd been there sixteen times before, or else plenty of places like it. Her big blue eyes were firing sparks at me that would have put a carborundum wheel out of business. And what they didn't say, the small calibre pistol in her tiny fist did! 

''Why you kill him?" her lips said. "Why? Why?"

The girl had worked herself into a frenzy and I wasn't taking any chances. The lead from the little ones is just as hot as the pellets from a .45, and besides --- she got careless and let me get too close. I lashed out at her and knocked the weapon from her hand, and as she lunged for it her mouth worked overtime. She yapped in a Slavic language I didn't understand, but the way she said it, I sure got the drift.

I kicked the pistol across the room and grabbed her. She was really a handful. I hung on trying to calm her down with words, but the way she fought it looked for sure like I was going to have to slug her.

"Murderer! Murderer!" she screamed hoarsely and sank her small white teeth deep into my hand.

I yelped with the pain and let go, and as I did she took off for the gun on the far side of the room. But the advantage was all with me; I used to play half-back. I left my feet, and my hundred and eighty-five pounds zinged through the air, catching her on the soft part of her side, just above the hip. I heard the air whoosh out of her lungs and I found that I was holding onto a gal with all the fight taken out of her.

<hr class="sec-break" />

She lay there with her eyes glassed over and her mouth gasping for air. I picked her up and dumped her unceremoniously on the couch, and then went over and pocketed the gun. By the time I got back, Sally Szabo had clear eyes again and was watching me with an anxious look.

"You must be nuts or something, baby," I snapped. "What gives with the cannon?"

Her lower lip made like a little kid and I thought for just a second that maybe she was going to cry.

"Why for did you kill him?" she asked brokenly. "He did nozing to you."

"Wait a minute, baby, I didn't kill him."

"You did, you did!"

"Oh?"

"When I came back to the cabeen, Grandpapa is dead, you gone and so is the painting that he treasured so!"

"You're a lousy mathematician, sister."

"So?"

"Two and two doesn't always make four," I growled.

"You're going to have to add better than that."

I watched her closely and barked, "I didn't swipe the canvas and I didn't kill the old man. I interview celebs, I don't murder them!"

The way she blinked at me I knew that I had her on a tight-rope of uncertainty; she wasn't sure any more.

"But ... but who could do this terrible thing to Grandpapa?" she whispered. "Why for? It is not such, how you say, valuable painting."

I perked up.

"No?"Then contradicted her.

"Ten grand is plenty valuable, baby."

"Graand?"

She tossed a faceful of confusion at me.

"What is this graand?"

Oh," I said and explained what the vernacular meant.

She grasped the idea fast and I got the nutty idea that it would be fun to teach her the language as I knew it.

"Hugh," she said through pursed lips as she sat up slowly, "I am believing you."

So now she was "believing me" and calling me Hugh. But you know something? I liked it, the way she said it, the soft sound of my name on her full lips, and the nearness of her warm body as she swayed toward me.

From the way her mouth quivered and her eyes explored mine, I got the bright idea that she was acting just like a gal who wanted to be kissed. I grabbed at her and pulled her lovely body toward me. Her lips waited to receive mine and she relaxed completely in my arms.

I felt a tug at my coat pocket and then I knew why the sudden switch. I tossed her backward against the cretonne-covered cushion and she lay there watching me, that small-calibre pistol of hers once again in her tight little fist. Her breath was coming fast with a sudden emotion that seemed to startle her, and her clear blue eyes held an astonished reflection of the mixed feelings she felt but couldn't quite understand.

"When I find it," she breathed, "when I find za painting, I find za murderer, yes?"

I noticed that she was trembling slightly but the ugly little muzzle of the piece in her fingers was as steady as a Saturday night date. She was right, too, about the murderer --- only for me it was with reverse English. When I found the guy who stuck the canvas in my tape recorder, I would find the killer.

"Look, baby," I said quietly, "about that gun ... I don't like it."

She didn't answer but there was a perplexed line around her tight mouth.

"When I was in the army," I went on grimly, "I was taught never to point a gun at a guy unless I intended to use it. So. ... "

I stood up and faced her.

"Go ahead, cutie, fire away!"

For a moment I was sure that she would. Then I got a load of the queer expression on her face and felt a cool draft on the back of my neck. I turned just in time to see the window go up the rest of the way and a little guy shove one leg over the sill.

He had a sharp, pointed face like a weasel and a heavy foreign accent.

"All right, little one," he squeaked in a high-pitched voice. "The gun is to drop on floor, so?"

Now I not only had a rod in my back but a Luger pointing at my front.

### Chapter 3

### Art Appreciation
{: .chaptertitle}

I glanced over my shoulder at Sally. She was staring at him with her popgun lunging loosely from her fingers. Then it slipped out of her palm and made a dull thud as it hit the carpet. The guy came over, side-stepped me and let the toe of his shoe pitch the gal's pistol clear across the room. He picked up her pocketbook off the couch and looked inside; then his frozen face broke open to form an evil grin.

"No more guns, little one? Unfortunate, yes?"

Sally's eyes looked big and frightened and I remember thinking that she couldn't be as hard-boiled as she pretended to be.

"You were told to stay out of this, little one," the guy with the Luger snarled. "We mean it, so to be sure --- "

Sally tried to duck and my mouth went through the motions of yelling, but we were both too late. The hard barrel of the gun came down across her head. She groaned just once, then folded up as if she didn't have any legs and lay as still as death on the floor.

I started forward but the round muzzle of the gun stopped me cold in my tracks. It was like being on the end of a two-foot chain.

"Now for you, my friend," he mouthed quietly. "Just like you pray, yes?"

I didn't understand so I said, "What does that mean?"

"Your knees," he bellowed. "To your knees!"

The monkey was all business. I obeyed him as if I didn't have any alternative, which I didn't. I sank to my knees and watched him circle behind me.

"Where iss the painting?" said his heavily accented voice.

I just knelt there and tried to figure if this was the guy and, if he were --- what kind of a damned fool I was for getting into it. This kind played for keeps.

He didn't argue and neither did he ask me a second time --- he just thundered his heavy gun across the side of my head. The lights in the room started acting as if they were on the marquee of a Broadway theatre. I could hear him screaming for the painting, and every time he asked he punctuated his sentence with the cold and painful dashes of his heavy weapon.

After a while I couldn't have spoken even if I'd wanted to. I just lay there with my face in the carpet, sucking up what little air there seemed to be left in the room and succeeding in getting mostly the thick particles of a three-day accumulation of dust.

I could hear him roaming around the place, tearing things apart, pulling out drawers and emptying closets. When he came back and I saw his legs standing over me, I managed to roll over on my back and look up into his face. It was just a white blur about ten stories above me, but I knew he was there from the way he kept plying me with questions about the painting.

Then I saw his outline come closer as he bent over me. He reached down and deliberately ran the jagged edge of the gun-sight up and down my chest until I felt the blood come through the torn fabric of my white shirt. His hand was going at a furious pace and so was his mouth, but somehow I couldn't hear him. I tried to speak but something had happened to my tongue --- I was both deaf and dumb.

In no time at all I was on fire with pain from my neck to my belly and my head came alive with all the screaming sounds of the jungle. I must have passed out for a few seconds, because when I came to, the window was wide open and weasel-puss was gone.

I staggered to my feet holding my hands to my bleeding body. All I wanted to do was get to the bedroom. I don't know quite how I reached it because the bed was a thousand miles away, but I finally made it and fell backwards, my eyes seeing only the white ceiling high above me.

Then I remembered the girl and tried to get up, but it was like trying to struggle out of a straight jacket. The marrow had queered out of my bones. I was helpless.

I couldn't move under any circumstances.

And that's when I saw her beautiful face bending over me and I looked right into her bright blue eyes and the dull black nose of that small-calibre automatic she loved so much.

"Where is the painting?" she said from far away. "Where is it?"

I knew what she said, all right, but I didn't care any more. Her face was twisted in what looked like a sardonic grin and her lips kept asking the same question over and over again.

The gun came closer ... closer --- until the dark interior of its barrel filled my vision. Her finger was white against the trigger. I just let go and relaxed against the soft mattress.

There was a loud noise in my ears and then the core of my head seemed to explode upward in one terrible burst of orange and yellow light, and I was swallowed up in the dark deadly embrace of complete oblivion. ... .

<hr class="sec-break" />

When I moved my head it throbbed like a pulmotor, but the pillow under it felt soft and cool and so did the small rivulets of water that I felt trickling down my chest. I looked up but couldn't see. Then I discovered the small moist towel over my eyes. I plucked it away and looked around.

I was stretched out on my own bed with cold wet towels criss-crossing my bare chest and stomach and Sally was coming out of the bathroom carrying an armful of things she'd found in my medicine chest.

"Oh," she said in a surprised tone, "you're awake."

I nodded but I wondered if I actually were awake to what was going on.

"You feel much bad, yes?" she queried.

"I've had a bigger head than this, baby, "I croaked.

"But," --- my finger pointed at my torso full of wet cloths --- "this is something else again."

She started to peel off the towels and I started to sit up, but she placed her small hand on me and shoved me gently back against the pillow.

"I'm afraid," she smiled, "that I, how you say --- ripped za shirt --- but I must do that."

"What does it mean, baby? Why did you stay, and why all the attention?"

"Even a dog I would not leave like that."

"Oh, thanks, baby," I squawked sarcastically. "That makes me feel real good."

"Oh, no, no, no!" her low voice rushed at me. "It means that I do not any more believe you killed my grandpapa."

"Good! That's one thing settled."And I lay back while she toweled the moisture from my body.

Where the rough gun sight had torn my flesh it was sore and painful but I hardly felt her Angers as she tenderly smoothed on the healing salve. After she'd finished taping me up, she sat there talking and I felt much better about everything.

"You feel good, yes, Hugh? I wouldn't want you to --- how you say --- not be okay."

I smiled.

"I'm okay, baby. A little dizzy, maybe."

The corners of her provocative mouth went up and she leaned forward.

Now let's be logical about this --- I wasn't that dizzy! I reached up and took her shoulders in both my hands. She didn't resist. While I was kissing her I felt her melt, and I knew that this time it wasn't because I had her gun.

She pulled her lips away from mine and looked at me with a strange bewildered expression.

"I am mixed, Hugh."

I laughed at her adorable slaughter of the English language.

"Who isn't!"

"But, Hugh," she whispered as her delicate fingers played with the lobe of my ear, "you have za painting, yes?"

"Damn it!" I barked. "Are you starting that again?"

She shrugged with an indifference that didn't ring true.

"And while I think of it, baby," I yapped, "what did that rat-faced louse mean about you being told to stay out of it?"

She shook her blonde head at me.

"I'm so puzzled, Hugh. I --- I no understand how a so little painting should cause all of thees. My grandpapa and then this to you. ... I don't know."

There was something deeper to this than just a ten-thousand dollar painting I started asking the gal questions, fishing for information.

She was cooperative but none of her answers helped much, and after a while I got to thinking that it could be she was more interested in recovering the painting than in grabbing the old professor's killer.

<hr class="sec-break" />

She told me that when old Szabo had fallen out of favor with the present regime in his country, he'd ducked up in the hills, first making sure that his only living relative got to Paris safely. That was Sally.

While the old man was hiding, he'd uncovered this painting hidden deep in a cave. Naturally, with his background, he'd recognized the intrinsic value of it, so he'd taken it with him and beat his way out of the Balkans.

Eventually he'd gotten to France and rejoined his granddaughter. Not having any dough he'd sold an interest in the ancient painting to a French art dealer for two passages to New York --- and that's as far as I got. Except that the Parisian dealer had flashed out publicity on the painting and every news service had played it up as an interesting story.

"But how about the weasel guy?" I pressed. "He said that you --- "

"Yes, yes, I know," she interrupted irritably. "That was after we had docked 
and I discovered what had happened. He rang me on the ship's phone and asked me many questions about grandpapa and the painting. Then he told me not to speak to anyone about it or I would --- I would --- "

"Yes, go on."

"He said that if I didn't, I would also die!" she said breathlessly.

"But I won't stop!" she added. "Do you hear me, Hugh? I won't, I won't!"

"Easy, baby, easy."She was tighter than a taut rubber band and I started wondering again where she'd parked her .25 calibre.

"He was so good," she went on. "He'd been through so much and now. ... "

"Don't look at me, baby, I didn't kill him."

The hard glint went out of her eyes slowly like a dying match.

"I know, Hugh," she said softly, and the question marks came back into her eyes. "But who did?"

And she might have added, what for? For a painting? Somehow that didn't make any sense either. She got up from the bed and started out with a brisk, determined walk. I stopped her at the door.

"Where are you going?"

"To see a friend of grandpapa's."

"Wait for me, baby. I'm going with you."

Old Professor Szabo's friend turned out to be a Roberto Husick, who ran a small curio shop on the lower East Side. Sally had never seen him, but she'd remembered that he was the guy who had contacted her grandfather about the painting before they'd sailed from Cherbourg.

"Grandpapa said that Mr. Husick had told him by wireless that the painting was worth a lot of money. "

I glanced at her quickly.

"More than, say, ten thousand?"

"Y-yes, I think so. A lot more."

"Why?"

But she didn't know any more than I did.

As we approached the small basement shop, I could see that the lights were burning dimly through the unwashed window. We went down the short flight of cement steps that showed the chipped effects of years of usage. The door jangled a light, cheery sound as the small bell on top announced our arrival.

Inside, I looked around; the place was empty! I waited a moment then called Husick's name --- there was no answer. I walked to the rear of the store and brushed aside the cheap green curtains that hung loosely in front of a small storeroom. I swallowed hard and turned quickly to stop Sally from entering, but she was already at my side and from the sick expression on her face I knew she saw it too.

A wizened little old man was sitting upright at a worn oak table. His head was leaning against the high, old-fashioned back of a huge Victorian chair, his eyes staring into space and white straggling locks of hair falling down over his forehead. But nothing could hide the ugly little blue-black hole between his two vacant eyes, and the red blood that had bubbled up over his face and down his shirt.

### A Sap Takes the Rap
{: .chaptertitle}

I felt Sally's fingers grip hard at my arm. A thin, faint sound came out of her lips, and her small features were set in a terrified mould of fear. I cupped her shoulder with my palm and tried to draw her away but she seemed hypnotized by the grim sight of the dead man.

"Ohhh," she breathed. "Ohhh."

And for just a second she swayed slightly against me. I pressured her shoulder and then propelled her out of there forcibly.

"C'mon baby," I whispered anxiously. "This is no place for us."

She stood leaning weakly against the wall while I turned and drew the long green curtains together the way I'd found them. Somebody spoke from behind me and the hair on the back of my head went all prickly.

"Turn around slowly, fellow," the voice said again. I knew that it had a familiar ring, only I couldn't card-index it. I spun around to face the guy from the Art Museum I'd met on the cutter, and for the third time in a few hours I was looking down the barrel of a gun.

"Jeff Barkley!"

"Yeah," he retaliated. "Fancy meeting you here."

"You're out of your league, Barkley. What are you doing here?"

I pointed at his weapon.

"And what's that for?"

He laughed.

"I don't have to answer questions, Crandall."He waved his right hand.

"You do."

Sally screamed and he turned to look at her. That was just about all I needed. I kicked out at his shin and at the same time my long right arm swept over his. The gun went flying across the shop and he grimaced in momentary pain as he reached for his aching leg.

When you get a chance like that you don't wait. I hammered him with short lefts and rights to his jaw, driving him back against the wall, and I didn't stop until he slipped to his knees and rolled over on his back. He got up slowly, weaving like a well-oiled bar fly, and by that time Sally was standing in back of him with his heavy gun in her slight fist.

Jeff Barkley looked around and rubbed the side of his jaw.

"You're crazy, Crandell. You don't know what this is all about. Better get out while you're still in one piece."

It was my turn to laugh and I did.

"You've kind of got it wrong, haven't you, mister? And what's an art critic doing with a gun, huh? What's the matter, no speakee?"

"Look, Crandall, be smart. That painting isn't what you think it is. Stay out of this while you still --- "

I didn't have a chance to stop Sally because she moved like a tigress. The heavy gun in her hand made an arc through the air, and when it came down it smashed across the museum guy's head with an awful sound. He moaned hoarsely like a sick little boy, pitched forward on his face and didn't move.

I grabbed the automatic out of her hand.

"For heaven's sake, Sally, what did you do that for? You might have killed him!"

She just stood there looking at me with a blank stare on her face. I dropped the pistol at Barkley's feet and, yanking Sally by the arm, moved out of that curio shop on the double.

The cruel ferocity with which she'd hit that fellow scared hell out of me. It was as though it were another person, not the Sally Szabo I thought I knew. Which also gave me the idea that could be I was being taken for a sap's ride that might very well end up on the other side of Limbo.

I decided to go down to see Lt. Stewart at Police Headquarters. Sally acted as though she were just going along for the ride. Somehow all the fire had seemed to go out of her after she'd hit Barkley. She sat next to me in the taxi like a gal with her body in one place and her mind in another.

Maybe it was just as well that Sally was with me when I told the lieutenant about the painting, because although he did cuss me out, her presence no doubt held him plenty in check.

"If ever a guy deserved a cell," he roared, "it's you!"

I agreed like a real affable guy.

"All right," he squawked, "we'll pick up the painting you mailed to yourself --- Now let's start again, and this time I want the complete story. Do I get it?"

With what had happened since old Professor Szabo's death, I wasn't keeping anything back. I dictated my statement to the police stenographer from A to Z --- A being how the professor had refused to come up on deck for the interview, and Z being the dead guy in the back room of the curio shop.

Which promptly reminded me that I'd told my assistant to meet me at the radio station to edit the day's tape. Harvey was probably still waiting like a nice little assistant.

<hr class="sec-break" />

After I dropped Sally off at her hotel I cut out for WZYH. Harvey was still waiting there all right, with a sullen look on his face. The ash tray on my desk was loaded with cold butts and his eyes with hot anger.

"You did say two hours, didn't you?''

I apologized for the delay without telling him why, and then added gasoline to his smouldering fire by telling him he'd have to edit alone.

"I don't feel so good tonight,'' I explained.

He crushed his cigarette in the glass tray with a vicious turn of his fingers and pointed to the bandage on his forehead.

"How do you think I feel?"

I shrugged without speaking, my attitude plainly saying: So who's boss?

"I should have let you know, Harvey," I admitted.

"Yeah," he replied in a stinging tone, "you should have. In the meantime I've been trying to reach you. Where you been?"

I ignored his long nose and his harsh tone.

"What did you call me for?"

"Somebody busted into your closet and pulled the recorder apart. What gives?"

I didn't feel like going into any detailed explanation with him. Besides I didn't like his whole manner. Which just goes to prove that when you're walking a tightrope you're not very reasonable. If I'd stopped and thought a minute. I'd have realized that my assistant had every reason to be miffed.

"See you in the morning, Harvey," I snapped crisply, and loped officiously out of the studio and back to my apartment.

If I had any crazy notions that by simply spilling the whole shebang to Lt. Stewart of Homicide I was going to chuck the whole business over my left shoulder and onto his broad back, I was sure due for a sweet surprise. It didn't take long in coming either.

I don't think I'd been home more than ten minutes when my little door buzzer made like New Year's Eve again. I went over and opened up. It was Sally. She had fresh makeup on her face and she had changed her clothes, but from there on the picture was the same as before --- that same old .25 calibre pistol was clutched firmly in her tight little fist.

She came in and closed the door behind her and I sat down deliberately and said disgustedly, "Oh, no, not again, baby."

"Again and again," she told me slowly, "until I have find what I want."

Maybe it was because I'd seen so much artillery that night that I wasn't disturbed by the wicked little pea-shooter she held on me. Anyway, I just sat there and asked, "All right, baby, I'll bite. What do you want this time?"

She sat down opposite me looking as harmless as a hooded cobra.

"You told that policeman that you had the painting yes? That you mailed it to you, yes?"

"That's right, baby. So what?'

"Think back, Hugh," she said with cold calmness. "Think back!"

And she looked at me as if I had five minutes to live.

My mind did a quick double-take and I didn't like what it came up with. She had said repeatedly that when she found the guy who had the painting, she would have the murderer.

I could feel little beads of perspiration start to form on my forehead.

"Wait a minute, baby! Hold everything," I yelped. "What I told them down at Homicide is the truth. I didn't take the canvas. It's just like I said --- I found it. Somebody else put it there."

But I could tell by the way her blue orbs had narrowed into wicked-looking slits that she didn't believe me.

"If you would lie to the police," she droned, "you would so do to me, no?"

"Who the hell lied to the police?" I shouted.

"You told that lieutenant that my grandfather wouldn't go up on deck for to be interviewed with you."

"So?"

"That is one beeg lie, Hugh."

"What!" I yelled.

"When you called on the ship's telephone, you were the one who told me not to let him come up --- that you would come down to the stateroom yourself."

She must have seen the complete incredulity show on my face because she paused uncertainly.

"But you did say that," she insisted. "I heard you myself."

Just then the buzzer sounded off again and I started forward. I stopped momentarily, but I saw that she wasn't going to prevent me from opening the door --- she was much too confused a little gal at that particular moment.

I put my hand on the door knob, swung it open and at the same time that I saw Harvey standing there the full impact of what Sally had said hit me, and I knew that I was face to face with the guy I'd been looking for --- old Professor Szabo's killer!

<hr class="sec-break" />

Some time I'm going to put a public service program on the air that will try to ascertain why it's so blamed easy for every Jack, Bill and Jenny to get a gun.

Harvey had one too, pointing right at the belt buckle that held up my pants. It was an Army .45 and believe me, brother, they make a hole big enough to --- well, big enough.

He slammed the door shut and Sally dropped her pop-gun at the same time.

"You're a fool, Hugh," he said. "How does it feel for the worm to turn, huh?"

That was the third time I'd been called a fool that night and it was beginning to hurt, but I got a load of his drawn face and tight finger and decided not to get tough.

"What's it all about, Harvey?" I queried in a soft careful voice.

He laughed harshly and brushed my question aside.

"Where's the painting, Hugh?"

Sally blurted out, "Then this is the one!"

I nodded coolly. "Yeah, baby, but don't ask me why. All I know now is that he did it; he killed your grandfather. He stashed the canvas in the back of my tape recorder, planted a cheap picture back in the old man's tube and conked himself on the noggin to fool me. It did, too. I was the conveying belt that carried the painting off the ship for him."

I broke off suddenly and then went back into gear.

"But I'll be hanged if I know why!"

Harvey seemed to be enjoying the byplay between Sally and me. He chuckled in an amused way that didn't help matters any.

"That's good deducting, Hugh," he grated in a thin voice. "But the rest you'll never know, do you hear me! You'll never know why."

His lips drew back as he snarled, "I want that painting --- now!"

Once again I felt that squirming mass inside my stomach roll over and play dead --- and there was also the familiar cold draft on the back of my neck. I glanced around and saw the little weasel-faced guy sitting in his accustomed spot on the window sill.

"You were paid to get it off the ship," his foreign voice bit through the tenseness of the room. "And that was all!"

He was squinting at Harvey as if his time were up.

"Why for you come here?"

I saw Harvey's mouth straighten out like a thin strand of plastic tape and it was only instinct that told me what was going to happen a split second before it did. I dove frantically at Sally, knocking her spinning to the floor, and at the same time my momentum carried me to the light switch.

The room was in Stygian blackness for a bare instant after I hit the carpet; then Times Square at night came to my apartment. I flattened out next to Sally, my arm holding her quivering softness close to me.

The repeated crash of the heavy forty-five mingled with the sharp barking sound of the German Luger, and orange spurts of flame traced a two-way track of violent death between the door and window.

It stopped as suddenly as it had started, and deafening silence blanketed the room. I groped my way through the thick, swirling smoke, my nostrils filled with the acrid smell of burnt gunpowder, and found the light switch. I hesitated for just one heart heat, then flooded the room with cold white light.

My living room held two pools of bright red blood that moved as they widened, but the two men lying in them didn't move at all

Sally was crying. I threw a coat around her shivering shoulders and held her to me. I knew I had to get her out of there fast, so I opened the door and we started out into the hall together.

We didn't get very far but went stumbling back inside. We had no alternative, not with Jeff Barkley standing there

with an ugly look on his face and an even uglier looking gun in his hand!

<hr class="sec-break" />

Believe me, I was more determined than ever to find out how come everybody and his kid brother has access to a loaded gun. But when the art museum guy told us why he packed an Army forty-five, I was glad he did. On him it looked good.

![How come everybody and his kid brother has access to a loaded gun?](/assets/img/short-stories/hold-that-tigres3.png)

He was Major Jeff Barkley, United States Army.

"I'm with the U. N., kids," he said with a grin.

"United Nations?" squeaked Sally.

He nodded.

"War Treasures Commission," he explained. "There's still a lot of stuff around that the Nazis buried away and it's our job to dig it up and return it to the rightful owners."

He went on although he seemed to be highly amused at the funny expressions on our faces.

"The old gent didn't know what he'd found and when we got wind of it, I was just a little too late on board ship."

"You mean the old professor's painting is on your list?"

"Yes, Crandall, it is, but not the way you figure it."

"Hub?" I said stupidly.

"Never take anything on its face value. For instance," he turned to Sally, "the painting that your grandfather stumbled on in that cave is a valuable one all right, probably worth about ten thousand artwise. But to us, and to certain others, it's worth about a million and a half!"

"What?" I croaked, and my ears shot up like an unbelting rabbit. "Say that again!"

He grinned good-naturedly.

"You heard me the first time, fellow --- a million and a half bucks."

Sally had already leaned back weakly on the couch. I joined her and stared at the guy with a look which plainly said: Which one of us is nuts?

"You've heard of General von Michelson, haven't you?" he asked.

I nodded. Who hadn't? The whole world was trying to figure out what the dead Nazi bigwig had done with the treasure in art, gold, and priceless relics he'd pirated from captive countries.

"The complete list of the hiding places is on the back of that little old painting the professor found," the major said.

"But I didn't see ... "

"Of course not, fellow,"Major Barkley said. "You can't see invisible ink with the naked eye!"

<hr class="sec-break" />

Well, Sally Szabo stayed around after that; as a matter of fact, she's probably the best damned assistant any radio interviewer could have. Besides, through her I got real interested in art --- how you say --- the kind you find hanging in museums and art galleries.

There's only one trouble. For the life of me I can't break myself of the nasty habit of looking at the back of every damned painting I see with a magnifying glass!
