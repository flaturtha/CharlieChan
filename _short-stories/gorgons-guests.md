### The Husband of a Lady Newshawk
{: .chaptertitle}

When you&#39;re the husband of a lady newshawk, you&#39;ve got to take things as they come.

And I mean if you&#39;re a person who never could be bluffed at &quot;follow-the leader,&quot; you&#39;re in for it.

I was saying something to this effect as Verda and I, having left our coupe in a ditch beside a slippery mountain road, were heading into the wet gloom of that wooded mountain valley. &quot;Sleepy Vale&quot; some early settler had named it. But as I saw it now beyond the veils of a windless spring rain it seemed not so much sleeping as bewitched, frozen under the spell of some cold and sinister enchantment.

I looked at Verda, plodding doggedly a little ahead and wished that I had refused to let her come. What did I care if it did happen that she had lived as a child in this wild tip end of the county from which the weird story had come? What did I care if she had promised to give the readers of her column, &quot;What Goes On,&quot; a first-hand account of the matter?

Glimpsing the set lines of her pert and lovely little face, the tension of her small body under the red-silk slicker, I knew now that it was no mere curiosity which had drawn her back here, but fear, a fear which she was willing neither to explain nor admit.

Still, I tried to keep my tone bantering as I said:

&quot;With all the excitement going on in Europe, blitzkriegs, secret weapons, parachute troops and God-knows-what, I can&#39;t understand why people bother with these nut-rumors. The next thing, they&#39;ll be sending you to Rochester, Washington, to interview Straining Annie, the hen who couldn&#39;t lay.&quot;

Verda didn&#39;t laugh.

&quot;If you had seen the face of that mountain-hiker when he told of the ungodly thing he saw, you wouldn&#39;t laugh, Bill,&quot; she said.

Well, maybe so. It was an eerie and nightmarish tale. The man had been hiking through the woods, he said, and had come into the mouth of the cave to rest a little while. There he had noticed, deeper in, a party of picnickers who had spread their lunch on the cave&#39;s floor. He had hailed them cheerily, and, getting no answer whatsoever, had stepped nearer.

Then he had noticed their faces. They were all turned toward the cave&#39;s depths, staring, he said, with the most awful expressions of horror he had ever seen on human faces. He said it struck him at once that terror so utter could not co-exist with life, and it was only as a second impression that he noticed the weird immobility of the group.

They hadn&#39;t moved an inch, not a fraction of an inch. Great ghostly stalagmite reared along the walls at this point, the man said, and the figures of these people seemed strangely blended with them, frozen there in the most commonplace postures. The woman was in the act of handing a sandwich to a boy of about ten. The man was on one knee, holding a bottle of beer.

A little girl was bending over, her chubby hands extended towards a small black and white dog. And even the animal was standing like a thing in terra cotta, its pelt bristling, its teeth bared in a silent snarl at something in the cave&#39;s depths.

The man said he had forced himself forward then with buckling knees while the full force of the terror on those frozen faces dawned on him. Then he had reached out and touched the man, had found his limbs as stiff and cold as marble. He admitted that he had turned and fled then.

It was the one believable part of his story. He had run to the village and a party of queerly reluctant men had accompanied him back. But when they got there they had found nothing in the cave at all.

My comment was that there had been nothing there in the first place. Verda seemed to think differently.

We had been climbing steadily, our footfalls muffled by the leaf mould, and had come into a region where tortured junipers and aspens broke the uniformity of pines. Beyond this a bald meadow was visible, and above it in the rocky hillside, the mouth of a cave, half hidden by thickets.

### Country of the Gorgons
{: .chaptertitle}

The sense of eeriness began to creep over me then. The rain had ceased but drops glistened like diamonds on the motionless leaves. No whisper of breeze disturbed their immobility, and the yellow light that came from a setting sun beyond the clouds cast a poisonous aura over the whole scene.

&quot;Do you remember, Bill,&quot; Verda broke the silence with a hushed whisper, &quot;how in the story of Perseus and Medusa the writer speaks of &#39;the pale yellow light that broods over the country of the Gorgons&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Country of the Gorgons!&quot; I exploded. &quot;I suppose it&#39;s Medusa, the Gorgon, in that cave, turning people to stone! Well, I&#39;m worried about something nearer home — where we&#39;re going to spend the night if we can&#39;t get that car out of the ditch.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;d thought of that. The Coll summer lodge is not far from here. Alton would be tickled for us to use it.&quot;

### Crazy Theories
{: .chaptertitle}

I frowned at that. Not that I had anything against Alton Coll. He was rich, and a poser, and a childhood friend of Verda, but had been no rival of mine. My dislike, I suppose, was the same every self-made man feels for the silver-spoon fellow of Alton&#39;s type, who roams the world — well heeled — pretending to discover the secrets and mysteries of strange races, and then goes about lecturing women&#39;s clubs in the role of one who has &#39;&#39;lived among the natives.&quot;

&#39;&#39;He&#39;s not up here now, is he?&quot; I asked.

&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;I think he&#39;s gone to Mexico. But he&#39;d be delighted for us to go in and make ourselves at home.&quot;

Well, I didn&#39;t doubt that. He and Verda had played together in this very valley when they were children. He was the son of rich summer vacationists, she the orphaned niece of the old village doctor. But all the same I didn&#39;t want to spend the night in his damned lodge. I wanted to go home.

I said as much, but Verda&#39;s feet were already whipping a path through the wet grass of the meadow, and presently we had fought through the thicket and were standing in the mouth of the cave itself.

The place had a musty, dank, evil smell. In the dim light we could see the stalagmites shining whitely, huddled there like the bloodless ghosts that swarmed to Ulysses&#39; offering of gore in Hades.

Verda must have had some similar thought, for she shivered and I caught her arm.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to go into that damned place, darling,&quot; I said comfortingly. &quot;That story was pure hooey. If not, they&#39;d have found some sign, but they didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s just it, Bill,&quot; she said, &quot;they didn&#39;t. It&#39;s as if the cave itself had swallowed them up, absorbed them!&quot;

&quot;Rot! I&#39;ll go in just to show you. Then we&#39;ll go back.&quot;

She put out a hand to stop me but drew it back and followed as I stepped into the gloom. Our footsteps sounded hollowly.

The rocky walls were lichen-covered, glistening with a sweat of dank dew. Deeper and deeper grew the gloom as we proceeded, and presently we saw the pool of water, shining dully on the floor like some giant&#39;s shield flung there eons ago.

&quot;Uncle Henry used to say,&quot; Verda whispered, &quot;that all things have conscious life — trees and plants and even rocks. He used to say that when the Gorgon turned men to stone, they just went back to an earlier form of life — the form in which life originally arrived on Earth from the stars.&quot;

I&#39;d heard those crazy theories, but I thought it was a bad time to air them. The fact is I was already beginning to have a queer feeling that those slimy walls were encroaching upon us as we progressed. Now I caught Verda&#39;s arm and we stopped and stared at the pool.

Pale growths of obscene, fat toadstools sprouted from the ooze about its marge. They rose in swollen masses toward the gleaming stalagmites along the walls. The crazy thought occurred to me that here were visible links in the chain of life that seemed to blend into one sentient substance.

For, as we advanced, our shadows, thrown dimly by the yellow glow from the cave&#39;s mouth had made the banked masses of fungoids seem to move. They gave the illusion of life, writhing and weaving snaky heads, like the half-animal barnacles on a ship&#39;s hull.

And then — pure fancy, of course — the sleek-skinned stalagmites, almost a flesh-pink in color, appeared to crawl with a weird sympathetic pulsation, as if they too were only one degree less alive.

But I shook this fancy off, struggling against the cave&#39;s oppressive atmosphere. I was about to pull Verda back when I saw the cat.

She was one of these roving house cats, I suppose, wild enough to roam the fields, yet too tame to fear humans, and she was moving along the opposite wall of the cave. A lank, loose skinned Tabby of a pinkish color, she moved with the long deliberate strides of the huntress while behind her tumbled with babyish clumsiness five little bundles of identical fur.

I caught Verda&#39;s arm and pointed. We watched while the cat and her litter moved on toward the pool. Field mice, she&#39;s after, I thought, or maybe young rabbits or the nest of some cave-dwelling bird.

And then something queer happened.

The cat had pushed through the fringes of the toadstool bed and turned to follow the tunnel&#39;s sudden twist. But facing that angle which was invisible to us, she suddenly stopped. The kittens stopped, too.

The cat&#39;s head was lifted; a sudden quiver shot through her muscles and a hiss started through her bared teeth. Started but broke off, as I never heard an animal&#39;s cry break off before. And then she froze, literally froze, with one front paw uplifted and her lashing tail paralyzed.

It happened so suddenly that I was stunned, but Verda, with a cry, started past me toward the kittens who had likewise gone rigid in their tracks.

&quot;Verda!&quot; I made a grab at her. &quot;Stay back here!&quot;

### Chapter 4

### The Cold Rigidity of Her Limbs
{: .chaptertitle}

But she was already past me and as I spurted forward to catch her my foot slipped on a slimy rock. I shot forward in an awkward sprawl among the toadstools and pulpy water growths at the pool&#39;s edge. I fell face down among the poisonous fungoids that, shaken, seemed to give off a strange sweetish odor that filled the cave. Then I was up, mud-spattered and panting, plunging toward Verda who was already some yards ahead.

&quot;Verda, come back!&quot;

Wiping the slimy water from my eyes, I abruptly halted. Verda had stopped. Against the deep gloom of the cave&#39;s depths I saw her bending as if to snatch the kittens up. But her head was lifted, staring, and her body had gone strangely still —

&quot;Verda!&quot; I shrieked in panic, already beginning to realize that she could probably no longer hear me. Then I reached her, touched her, felt the cold rigidity of her limbs.

I tried to shake her, move her, chattering insanely as I stared into her set, horror-contorted face. But it was no use. In desperation I lifted her then, as one lifts a log, and started staggering back toward the outside.

The sweetish smell was all around me now, and presently my knees began to buckle. Whether it was sheer terror, or the touch of Verda&#39;s cold flesh setting up a sympathetic paroxysm in my body, I could not tell. But as I slogged through the slimy pool my movements grew slower. Great weights seemed fastened to my feet, seemed tugging at my nerves and muscles. With a wild sense of nightmare I felt as if the cave itself were sucking me back, sucking my very being into its insensate embrace.

Praying, yammering to myself, I somehow floundered on. Once I staggered and fell, but managed to shield Verda&#39;s body from the jar. Half lifting, half dragging her, I wormed my way in a partial faint toward the open air.

I made it somehow and then my consciousness dimmed and flickered and went out.

What brought me to my senses, I suppose, was the roar of the landing plane. I sat up suddenly, stared across Verda&#39;s rigid body and saw in the fading dusk the great birdlike shape zoom down and come to rest in the meadow! Next instant two figures piled out and came running up the slope.

I rose, instinctively reaching for the gun in my coat pocket. Then the first figure burst through the thicket, throwing back his helmet and goggles. I thought I must still be dreaming. The man was Alton Coll!

&quot;Alton!&quot; I gulped. &quot;How on earth did you — &quot;

He halted, staring wildly at Verda.

&quot;Is she — &quot; he went down on his knees and grasped one of her hands. &quot;There&#39;s a pulse,&quot; he gasped. &quot;Thank God, I got here in time!&quot;

&quot;In time?&quot; I repeated dazedly.

Alton looked steadily at me. His thin pale face was drawn, his dark eyes burned feverishly under the domelike brow.

&quot;Bill,&quot; he said, &quot;why in God&#39;s name did you let her come here? Didn&#39;t you realize the danger?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t talk in riddles,&quot; I snapped. &quot;If you know what&#39;s wrong with her, say so. Will she be all right, will she come out of it?&quot;

Still looking at her anxiously, he nodded.

&quot;Yes. But it&#39;s lucky you managed to drag her out in time. I was on my way back from Mexico when I happened to get the home town paper and see that column of hers. Just like her, coming up here for a story! I knew I&#39;d have to get here and stop her and I&#39;ve been flying steadily ever since. But just now, when I saw you two lying there, I thought for certain I had failed.&quot;

&quot;But what do you mean — what would have happened if I hadn&#39;t — &quot;

### Based On Something Real
{: .chaptertitle}

&quot;He&#39;d have turned to stone,&quot; Alton said solemnly.

I stared. Was he crazy? He read my thoughts, went on:

&quot;Verda probably hasn&#39;t told you much, Bill, or you&#39;d never have let her come here. But she knew and I know, just as these close-mouthed valley people know, that this cave is &#39;bad&#39;. Things have happened here over a period of years, and the natives have got so they won&#39;t talk about it. There are forces in there that are inhuman, uncanny, horrible beyond imagination.&quot;

&quot;Alton,&quot; I said, &quot;you can&#39;t mean that you believe in a — in a Gorgon-monster that turns all who look at it into stone?&quot;

Alton Coll looked away.

&quot;The Gorgon,&quot; he said gravely, &quot;like all other myths, was based on something real. The Gorgons had their birth in the sea caves of Libya. What they were, I don&#39;t pretend to know. Behind their mythological symbol is some awful force with the power to transform living flesh into stone, by some sudden and mysterious process of petrifaction. That seems self-evident.&quot; He looked at Verda again; the color was returning slowly to her cheeks.

&quot;She&#39;ll be all right. I can tell because I went through the same experience. If Gaines here,&quot; he gestured toward the stocky figure of the mechanic who had followed him and stood silently by, &quot;hadn&#39;t pulled me out in the nick of time, it would have been all up with me.

&quot;But you say,&quot; I interrupted, &quot;that Verda knew this?&quot;

&quot;Knew it? Why, of course she knew it. Don&#39;t you know about her uncle? He vanished in that cave ten years ago.

&quot;She never told me how he died,&quot; I said.

&quot;If he did die,&quot; Coll answered. &quot;People around here, you see, said the old man was crazy. The fact is old Henry Ames believed in a sort of animistic philosophy and had a theory to account for the weird processes at work in that cave. He vanished while investigating.&quot;

So that was it. I recalled now Verda&#39;s whispered words about his belief in the livingness of stone. And if the old man had been really mad, wasn&#39;t it possible that he might be still alive, haunting the depths of the cavern, busy at some unholy business? Was that why Verda had been so set on coming here, yet so fearful, so reluctant to confide in me?

&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;we&#39;d better get Verda to a doctor anyhow.&quot;

&quot;Luckily,&quot; Coll replied, &quot;I have a doctor at hand. Dr. Leander has been using my summer place while I was away. I&#39;ll get him at once. But, Bill, we&#39;d better do more than that, we&#39;d better do something about this place — either destroyed the thing that&#39;s in it or seal it up former!&quot;

I looked at his grim, feverish face. All these years he must have known, but must have been afraid to do anything, after his near-disastrous experience. Now he was determined. And I agreed with him.

&quot;I&#39;ve got guns at the lodge,&quot; he went on, &quot;and dynamite. If you&#39;re game we&#39;ll try to get at the source of this hellishness. But if the thing — whatever it is — drives us out, we&#39;ll have a charge of dynamite already set, and we&#39;ll blast the cave&#39;s mouth shut forever. You&#39;ve got a gun there. You can guard Verda until we get back with the doctor and the weapons.&quot;

They went back through the thicket and headed into the woods, leaving me racked by a thousand crazy doubts and conjectures. Was it possible that such a thing as Coll suggested really existed? Even now, after what I had seen with my own eyes, it was hard to believe it. But if not, then what?

Gripping my gun, I stared into the cave&#39;s mouth, seeking some clue in that abysmal darkness. Was Verda&#39;s mad uncle still roaming those black corridors? Was he carrying on some weird experiments that required living, human subjects? Undoubtedly his madness must be the reason Verda had mentioned him so infrequently. And if this were true, it was natural that she should have wanted to come here and investigate for herself.

And yet — ten years was a long time for an old doctor to live in there.

Doctor. That brought back the Dr. Leander whom Coll had mentioned. I had heard of the man, but didn&#39;t know much about him, hadn&#39;t known either that he was Alton&#39;s friend. But Alton was apt to pick up all sorts of freaks. He was gullible, a sucker for flattery, and a fool. Had he lent his place to some man who was using it for sinister purposes?

If so, it would be poor strategy to wait until Leander was summoned. I tried to think of what I had heard about the man, but couldn&#39;t remember much. He had been connected with the faculty of the state university, I thought, a research man, chemotherapy his field.

Suddenly I remembered that weird smell in the cave, that faintly sweetish odor which tugged at some hidden memory. What had it been? What connotation did it evoke? I was standing there sniffing the air when the crisp voice from behind me ordered: &quot;Get your hands up!&quot;

I whirled, starting to raise my gun. But the muzzle of an automatic was already leveled at my middle.

&quot;Can you fly a plane?&quot;

The man was small but thick-set, long-armed. Under a bristling thatch of thick hair, his face was a pallid mask; weak eyes glared from behind thick spectacles. The memory of a news-photo flashed into my mind.

&quot;And what if I can. Dr. Leander?&quot; I asked.

&quot;So you recognize me?&quot; he said. &quot;Very well. I judge you can fly, from your answer. You&#39;re going to accompany me to the plane and pilot it according to my directions.&quot;

I stared at him, hesitating. I knew now that my suddenly formed theory must be correct. Only I had formed it too late. Leander, surprised in his nefarious work, whatever it was, by Coll&#39;s sudden return, was seizing this desperate chance to escape.

&quot;But my wife,&quot; I said, sparring for time. &quot;I can&#39;t leave her.&quot;

&quot;Pick her up then,&quot; he ordered, &quot;and bring her along.&quot;

I stooped. To attempt to shoot it out with him would endanger Verda. But if I obeyed, once in the plane we were both at his mercy. But if I could manage to shield her with my body — I fumbled, getting my hands under her; my eyes were still on the barrel of Leander&#39;s gun. Suddenly I lurched, throwing myself across her as I dived at his middle. His gun, flung up by my charge, blasted into the air; then my head struck his belly, catapaulted him back. He struck the ground with a jar and I leaped upon him.

He fought like a wildcat, raking my face with his clawed fingers, gouging at my throat. But I was stronger. Forcing him into a position where I could get a swing at his head, I brought the butt of my automatic smashing against his skull. He relaxed and lay still.

I sprang up, half expecting to meet the rush of a confederate. But apparently he had none, had meant to escape alone. Yet there must be an assistant somewhere about; someone must have been in the cave to release the deadly power that had paralyzed Verda. And Leander himself hadn&#39;t come out of there. Now if I waited, allowed myself to be taken by surprise —

### The Cave
{: .chaptertitle}

No, attack was the best offensive. It meant leaving Verda; but helpless there she ran less risk of being harmed than if she were conscious. Besides, Coll would be returning any moment now. I stooped down, tied Leander&#39;s hands behind him with my handkerchief, bound his ankles with my belt.

Then, gripping my automatic, I stepped into the cave.

It was almost dark outside now and the gloom within the cave was dense. I had a small pocket flash, but I dared not risk using it. As slowly and as silently as possible I crept toward the pool with its ghostly guardian stalagmites.

I sniffed the air as I went. Though I still could not identify the smell I had detected before, something told me that it was the clue to the danger. I would be safe until I inhaled it. Then —

I reached the pool, pushed through the rustling toadstools, felt my way along one dank wall. The cave became a tunnel, twisting this way and that until all light was shut out. Still I groped on in total darkness, the echoes of Coll&#39;s wild talk accompanying me like a ghostly escort. Living flesh turned to stone by some ungodly chemistry. Absurd, of course, and yet —

Abruptly I stopped. I had been feeling my way along the wall to my right, running my hands over the sleek damp surface of the stalagmites when, with no warning at all, my fingers touched something that caused my blood to freeze. It was cold and damp, and crystal-hard like the rest, but — yes, there could be no mistake — it had the shape of a human hand!

They say the basic fear of all is horror of the unknown. I can believe it. If actual physical fear for my life had been foremost, I should never have flashed on my light at that moment. But in the instant that I recognized that unseen shape for what it was, all physical fear was swallowed in the vortex of a sheer mental horror so awful that it swept all caution aside.

I flashed on the light. And what had been a vague and hideous conjecture became a still more hideous certainty.

Hand it was, that cold, clawed crystalline thing, thrust out like a branch from the trunk of this queer stalagmite. But that wasn&#39;t all. For the shape of that humped stalagmite itself was vaguely, horribly human — the shape of a crouching man, the outstretched hand still taloned to grip something which might have been — a bottle.

I was too numbed now with horror to draw back as my eyes flew among the massed and monstrous formations.

I began to note others that, like the first, were slightly different in color, whiter and with shapes too hideously suggestive to be accidental. There was a woman, also extending a hand as if proffering a gift; there was a lad half rising to his feet, and there — most gruesome of all — was the chubby shape of a little girl!

&quot;This is madness!&quot; I said. &quot;It must be the light, throwing grotesque shadows.&quot; But I knew it wasn&#39;t. Misshapen and featureless as these contorted shapes were, they were certainly what had been the picnic party that the mountain hiker had seen. And if that were so my rational theories collapsed before the awful thought that Coll had been right, that some power, monstrous and beyond human comprehension had its habitation here.

And then I heard the hissing.

It came from somewhere deeper in the cave&#39;s shadows, yet I found myself unable to turn and face it. For there suddenly flashed into my mind the memory of a painting I had seen of the Gorgon&#39;s head — that fearful Medusa visage, twisted with agony, with the living snakes that grew out of her skull, writhing and hissing in horrid convolutions. The Gorgon&#39;s head that turned men into stone. If I turned, saw it hanging in the fetid dark —

I couldn&#39;t — And yet I did.

It was the smell that released me. For as it drifted to my nostrils there flashed into my brain the identifying word: &quot;Geranium.&quot; With that came the memory that explained all. But with it too came the realization of a new and no less actual danger.

### Chapter 7

### The Hissing and the Geranium Smell
{: .chaptertitle}

I whirled, spraying the light down the crystalline aisle, sweeping it over the massed stalagmites. Then I saw the bulky shape in gas mask and coveralls, crouching by a huge stalagmite against which leaned a bullet-shaped drum such as are used for compressed air.

It was from this that the hissing came — the hissing and the geranium smell. I raised my gun, fired. The man must have been unarmed, must have depended on the deadly invisible gas to overpower me before I could shoot. At any rate, as my gun blasted, I saw him clutch his belly and topple back with a scream. It was very nearly the last thing I saw.

For the geranium-smelling gas, which I now knew to be some far more potent development of the &quot;nerve-gas&quot; identified by that smell and reputedly used by the Germans, was still jetting from the cylinder. And already my muscles were being invaded by a strange debility, were freezing to rigidness. I couldn&#39;t have run. Upright I might have staggered a few steps; but then I should have stiffened to immobility. What I did was simply relax, let myself fall to the floor.

I fell flat and, with my nose as close to the floor as possible, took a deep breath of the purer air and began to crawl. It was like pulling some terrific weight to make my muscles act, but I knew that every inch was taking me farther from the source of danger.

&quot;On, on,&quot; I kept rasping through locked teeth as I fought off the slow freezing of my limbs.

And now the pool was in view, and beyond it faint light seeping in from outside and a distant mutter of voices. They must have heard my shot, must be debating the best way to rescue me! Thank God, Alton had come back in time. Even if I collapsed now, they&#39;d drag me out.

But what was that ? Another hissing sound, a spark traveling across the floor at the cave&#39;s mouth. My heart sank. It was the sputtering fuse carrying fire to the dynamite-charge!

There was only time for me to throw myself in a wild lunge against one wall. Then the world cracked open with a titanic blast, as, roaring like an avalanche, the ceiling of the cave came crashing down.

I saw only that first blinding flare, for I had buried my head under my folded arms. When I raised it again, rocks were still rolling and rumbling, and the air was full of dust and the stench of burned powder. But the cave in must have been confined.to the opening. I was uninjured.

Uninjured, yes — but buried alive!

I snapped on the flash, flung its beam forward. A huge mass of dislodged rock sealed the cave&#39;s opening securely. But how had it happened? Why had Coll set the blast, knowing I was inside? Or had he known it? Perhaps Leander, his senses recovered, had duped him with some lie.

I got up and staggered toward the barrier that cut me off from the living world. Perhaps I could yell and make them hear me. There would still be time to dig me out.

The barrier, I found, was composed for the most part of huge blocks of stone ripped from the ceiling and walls by the blast. There were interstices through which currents of fresh air were coming. I leaned nearer, listening to the voices outside. Leander was speaking.

&quot;But I tell you I didn&#39;t, Alton,&quot; he was whining. &quot;I didn&#39;t know it was you. I just sneaked out here to find out — &quot;

&quot;The hell you did!&quot; Coll cut him short. &quot;You meant to escape. You meant to take your formula with you and leave me holding the sack with this mess you and your assistant made of things while I was gone.&quot;

MY blood ran cold at that. My last hope of rescue faded as I realized that Coll was the real fiend behind it all. I listened as he raged on:

&quot;I warned you to be careful. But no sooner had I got away to contact our buyers than your blunders started — coming to a climax in the damn fool carelessness that let those picknickers get caught by an overdose of the gas. When I heard about that I knew I&#39;d have to get back here and take charge.&quot;

&quot;But we didn&#39;t know they were in there,&quot; Leander babbled. &quot;We were working with animals deeper in the cave and the fumes leaked out and overcame those people. We had to cover up as best we could. We couldn&#39;t bury their bodies, of course. The graves would have been noticed, animals may have spotted them. But we took them deep into the cave and hid them among the stalagmites. I worked out a formula for a calcareous compound almost exactly the color of the stalagmites themselves, and we poured it over those dead people. If this woman and her husband hadn&#39;t come nosing in before we were finished they&#39;d never have been found or noticed in a thousand years.&quot;

&quot;But they did come in,&quot; Coll stormed, &quot;and you let the man escape. He was armed, too. If I hadn&#39;t arrived in the nick of time, handed him that wild story which I knew would trick him into going back in there where we could dispose of him safely, our whole game would have been lost. But why go on? When a man&#39;s been the sort of fool you have, he&#39;s ripe for a purge.&quot;

The doctor&#39;s wild scream broke off Coll&#39;s speech.

&quot;If you kill me,&quot; Leander shrieked, &quot;you&#39;ll never get the formula. You think my process for changing the acetyl choline into a gaseous form is all there is to it. But it isn&#39;t. There&#39;s the element that causes the instant muscular rigidity, and you&#39;ll never find that out — &quot;

Coll laughed.

&quot;I&#39;ll find the formula on you after you&#39;re dead!&quot;

A shot rang out. I knew the murderous drama was finished.

In the stifling darkness I shivered with hopeless desperation. What would Coll do with Verda? Against the barrier of these rocks a Titan would be helpless. And Verda was only yards away, utterly in his power!

I turned, searching the darkness as if for some spark of hope. If there were any other outlet from the cave, Coll wouldn&#39;t have trusted to the blast to seal me up —

But wait! Had he trusted to it? Hadn&#39;t he expected the man in the gas mask to finish me off with the deadly fumes? And if they were using the cave for an experimental chamber wouldn&#39;t they have provided some secret exit in case of surprise?

Spurred by this hope, I plunged back into the cave. This time I kept my light on and raced swiftly through the twisting labyrinth, searching the walls for some branching tunnel. I passed the man in the mask, lying dead where he had fallen by the gas cylinder which had ceased to hiss. An aperture among the stalagmites led into a smaller chamber, and here, with a gasp of joy, I saw the tunnel that led out.

It was narrow and low and I had to stoop to pass through it, but it led up at a sharp angle and presently I was able to glimpse the night sky. Crawling out I found myself on a narrow ledge above the cave&#39;s mouth. Clumps of cactus shielded it from the view below. I crawled to its edge, stared down and saw two shadowy figures bending over Verda&#39;s body.

&quot;Still unconscious,&quot; I heard Coll mutter. &quot;That&#39;s good. We&#39;ll pile her into the plane and by the time she comes out of it we&#39;ll be across the line in Mexico.&quot;

&quot;What about Fred — in the cave?&quot; the mechanic Gaines asked.

&quot;The hell with him!&quot; Coll barked. &quot;Get hold of her.&quot;

They began to lift Verda&#39;s body. The gun was in my hand, but with both of them that near to Verda I couldn&#39;t shoot. And the airplane was only yards away. I couldn&#39;t stop them before they got there, and once at the plane it would be too late!

As they straightened under her weight, I grabbed a small rock and hurled it at a spot of brush some twenty yards from them. It struck with a crackling sound that caused them to pause.

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Coll snapped. He dropped Verda, turned.

### A Bead On Him
{: .chaptertitle}

I flung another rock. Coll took a forward step, raised his gun and fired at the sound. I got a bead on him then and pressed my trigger.

Which of my shots struck him, I don&#39;t know, but his gun ceased to blast; he dropped, began to roll down the slope. At the same time Gaines&#39; gun started chipping splinters from the rocks about my head. I swung my gun down on him, but it was empty.

&quot;Another shot,&quot; he yelled, &quot;and I&#39;ll kill the woman.&quot;

Well, there was no choice now. Even if I just lay still he might carry out his threat. I had to draw his fire. I staggered up in full view, started plunging, in a small avalanche of rocks, down the steep gradient toward him.

Slugs whistled past me as I tried to duck and yet keep my balance. One gouged the wrist of my outflung hand, and then, as I had hoped, his gun was empty too. He stooped to snatch the second weapon from Coll&#39;s hand, and straightened just as I came floundering down to his level.

He never got a shot with that second gun. There was a terrific impetus in my rush and I struck him like a tornado. The impact flung him back. As he staggered up, I closed in, slugged my gun butt against his skull.

I was glad I didn&#39;t kill him. Gaines lived to expose not only Colls&#39; and Leander&#39;s scheme to perfect the deadly nerve-gas and sell it to a foreign power, but also details which made it possible for the F.B.I. to round up the secret agents with whom Coll had been negotiating. As for the gas formula itself, it wasn&#39;t found. Leander, too wary to carry it on his person, had hidden it in some place from which it has never been recovered.

Verda woke from her paralysis while I was flying her back to the city in Coll&#39;s plane, and when I told her the story she did not seem greatly surprised.

&quot;Yes, I thought perhaps it was Alton,&quot; she said.

&quot;You did? And you didn&#39;t tell me!&quot;

&quot;If I had, Bill,&quot; she said, &quot;you&#39;d never have let me come. I had to hide the real reason for my fear. Of course I wasn&#39;t sure, but I knew Alton&#39;s character — a vain, mediocre man with no principles — just the type a foreign power would win over for a spy. That&#39;s why he made those lecture tours of his. They were his front. As for the gas, he dropped a hint about that once — before the war started — boasting about a secret he&#39;d learned that would make the old Gorgon stories come true. I remembered that when the hiker told his story, and it set me thinking.&quot;

&quot;And Alton suspected that you might have remembered it,&quot; I said. &quot;He knew when you came here that he had to get you out of the way at all costs.&quot; I gave a retrospective shiver. &quot;And he didn&#39;t miss it much. But from now on, darling, I&#39;m wearing the pants. And if there are any more, &#39;follow-the leader&#39; games, I&#39;m going to be the leader.&quot;

She was agreeable — for the moment, anyhow.
