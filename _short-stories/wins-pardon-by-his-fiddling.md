Virtually fiddling his way to a full pardon from the State penitentiary, of  Huntsville, Texas, is the experience of Enrique Rosoplo, a Chilian artist and musician found guilty of the charge of stealing diamonds in El Paso. Rosoplo is nothing if not a sentimentalist, and his experience has taught him the part that music plays upon the human emotions.

When he learned recently that Governor Pat M. Neff (28th Governor of Texas, from 1921 to 1925) was planning to make a visit of inspection to the penitentiary, he obtained permission from the warden to send to his old home in El Paso for his violin. For several days before the date set for the governor's arrival, the convict spent all his spare time practicing his most appealing selections.

On the day of the inspection, Rosoplo asked for and received permission to play for the governor. The convict entertained for an hour, playing as he had never played before, and concluding with "Home, Sweet Home." This was rendered with so much feeling that Governor Neff was much impressed. The convict then made his plea for freedom and received the promise of a pardon.

An investigation showed that Rosoplo was a noted painter and musician of Mexico, where he was well known to many persons of political and social prominence.
