Harry and Alice, everybody agreed, were about the poorest excuse for a happily married couple that the town had ever seen. Almost every night, the neighbors could hear the roaring voice of big Harry arguing with slim, blonde Alice, shouting at her, insulting her.

After a while, there might be silence. You could only hear the sound of Harry's fists if you listened very closely. The neighbors prided themselves on not being eavesdroppers, and besides, they didn't want to get involved. They didn't listen to the blows that followed many of the arguments.

What's Your Verdict? 

By Sam Ross

Harry and Alice, everybody agreed, were about the poorest excuse for a happily married couple that the town had ever seen. Almost every night, the neighbors could hear the roaring voice of big Harry arguing with slim, blonde Alice, shouting at her, insulting her. After a while, there might be silence. You could only hear the sound of Harry's fists if you listened very closely. The neighbors prided themselves on not being eavesdroppers, and besides, they didn't want to get involved. They didn't listen to the blows that followed many of the arguments.

Things might have gone on that way for some time, if Tim Ellis hadn't heard about it.

The neighbors had kept the facts of the situation from Tim, who lived on the other side of town, because they knew that he'd been in love with Alice and probably would have married her if Harry hadn't been around. Tim was a shy, quiet boy with glasses, but he had a terrible temper. There was no telling what he'd do when he got mad. And when some of the neighborhood kids dropped a few hints about Harry and Alice, Tim got mad.

His mother tried to dissuade him from confronting Harry, but Tim stood firm. The very next night after he'd discovered what was going on, he marched across town to the house where Harry and Alice lived.

He heard the voices halfway down the block. They stopped just before he got to the house itself, but he didn't even slow his stride. Behind his rimless glasses his eyes were glittering and small as he rapped on the door.

There was no answer. From inside the house came the sound of a blow. Tim knocked on the door again. Harry's footsteps came to the door and Harry swung it open.

He just stared at Tim without saying a word. Tim didn't speak either, but moved right past Harry into the house. Alice was huddled in a corner of the living-room, against a divan. Her shoulders were shaking with sobs. The sight of her was the final spark that really set Tim off. Harry was a few steps behind him, so Tim moved forward quickly, grabbed a poker from the fireplace set, turned and rapped harry over the head with it.

Harry went down. When he was on the floor, Tim turned to Alice.

He tried to say something tender and protective. But he didn't have a chance.

"You murderer!" Alice screamed. "The least you could do is call a doctor."

By this time Tim was calmed down. Though sure Harry was dead, Tim called a doctor, and when the doctor came, Tim got the shock of his life.

Harry was pronounced in good condition. The doctor did insist on a few days of hospitalization, but after that, he said, Harry would be as good as new.

Tim simply left the house during the excitement and went home. Nobody noticed he had gone. He stayed home for three days.

By then Harry was settled in the hospital. Alice watching over him day and night and helping to feed him most of the hospital meals. But by some mischance, one shipment of food was tainted --- filled with the microscopic botulins which cause food spoilage and which result in ptomaine poisoning. Alice innocently fed harry some of that food.

Harry, along with one other inmate of the hospital, died of its poison that night. Working frantically, doctors and nurses managed to save the rest of the patients. But the damage was done.

When the uproar had died down and the hospital had established new checks against food spoilage, Alice went to a lawyer and had Tim arrested for homicide.

"After all," she argued, "If Tim hadn't hit my Harry over the head with a poker, he'd never have gone to the hospital, and he never would have been poisoned."

When Tim found out what Alice was up to, he protested violently.

"How was I to blame?" he asked Alice and her lawyer. "The doctor admitted I didn't cause Harry any serious injury with that poker. He had to go to the hospital for a few days, but that's nothing serious. He just had bad luck, that's all.

Who is right? What's *your* verdict?

{: .bold .bloodred}

It was Tim who had the bad luck. The law rules that, if there is a assault with intent to kill, and the assault puts the victim in a situation where death is the result, then --- even though the man committing the assault didn't intend his victim to meet death in that form --- the man who committed the assault is liable to conviction for homicide. In this case, Alice was left all alone, since Time, after a brief trial, was packed off to prison.
