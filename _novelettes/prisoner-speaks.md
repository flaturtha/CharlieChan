### The State of Washington vs. Samuel Smith
{: .chaptertitle}

In the case of the State of Washington vs. Samuel Smith, charged with the murder of his wife, Hattie Smith, the prosecution has introduced witnesses who swore that:

The defendant, Samuel Smith, was violently jealous of his wife, and on numerous occasions had been heard to threaten to kill each one of several men whom he believed or imagined to have paid too great attention to the said Hattie Smith, described as a beautiful woman by all who knew her.

No direct evidence was adduced to show that he had included his wife in these threats, or coupled her name with those of the men named. This inference, however, was skilfully presented to the jury in the opening address of the prosecuting attorney. The latter further strengthened this idea by his questioning of the witnesses.

Statements were elicited from more than one that the belief of the community was, as one expressed it, &quot;that Hattie Smith had better watch her step, or that husband of hers will kill her one of these days during one of his fits of rage.&quot;

Nor had it been shown that anyone actually had seen or heard Smith threaten or quarrel with his wife. But again the impression that he had done so was conveyed by the questions asked and the answers elicited by the prosecuting attorney, who displayed great cleverness and legal ability in his handling of the case. In more than one instance he succeeded in making very substantial mountains of solid threat out of what were, in themselves, molehills of evidence. So favorable was the impression he made, by his masterly performance of his duties, that before the case came to an end, he was mentioned as a possible candidate for the governorship in the campaign then pending.

While the evidence tending to show Smith&#39;s guilt was entirely circumstantial, it was damning in its weight and directness, in the particularity of all those incriminating details that hammer home a belief which often is fully as strong as that supported by the testimony of eye-witnesses.

To secure a conviction for murder the law requires, as a primal factor, the proof of the corpus delicti; that is, &quot;the body of the offense&quot; — the fact that a human being has been murdered. This essential fact being established and evidence submitted sufficient to secure an indictment, the next step is to connect, or attempt to connect, the defendant with the crime proven. Circumstantial evidence, to secure conviction, must exclude every other hypothesis except that of guilt. Time, place, motive and means are established, or sought to be established.

All of these requirements had been met by the prosecuting attorney.

The evidence adduced by the State had set up as facts the following answers to these statutory demands:

As motive, an unreasoning and unfounded jealousy and suspicion, leading to ungovernable rage beyond all restraint.

The opportunity and place for committing the crime without arousing an alarm, or even immediate suspicion, was provided by the fact that Samuel Smith and his wife lived in a house on the very fringe of the outskirts of the town of L — , some distance from the main route of travel, and with the house of the nearest neighbor fully a quarter of a mile away.

The time, as nearly as it could be determined by the prosecution, was &quot;some time between the hour of 7:15 P. M. of November eleventh and the hour of 1:30 A. M. of November thirteenth,&quot; the first named being the hour when the deceased was known to have been seen alive the last time, and the latter the time when her dead body was discovered.
