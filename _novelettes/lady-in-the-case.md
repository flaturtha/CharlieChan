### Love
{: .chaptertitle}

This love business, Lt. Jim Dink of Homicide decided, had gone a bit too far. The crushed body on the pavement beside the Mardott Hotel was the fifth death for love in a month. Dink stepped away from the crowd on the lawn and looked upward, eight stories where drapes flapped out of an open window.

Instinctively his bulging green eyes traced the fall of the body, down before the height of brick and windows to the thin width of the walk that bordered the green lawn. Dink&#39;s wide lips shifted the frayed cigar to the other corner of his mouth. Beyond the police line, the curious crowd craned and gaped. Traffic on the boulevard that bordered Fall Creek was tied up in knots. There sounded the far-off wail of the ambulance.

One of the detectives had already given Dink a brief resume of what was found. This fellow, Werner, had typed a farewell note to his sweetheart and had deliberately walked out into thin air. It could happen, of course, had happened four times before. Dink wondered if Dan Cupid could be subpoenaed for murder.

Lieutenant Dink wished profanely that guys would take their loving or leave it, instead of taking nose-dives out windows because of some frail with a come-hither look. He pushed his soft hat back on his thinning hair and the tops of his big ears folded slightly under the brim. He bit down savagely on the cigar and walked away from the men around the body.

The drive of the Mardott Hotel arched in from the street between aloof potted plants and there was an aloof arch over the doorway. The uniformed doorman looked a little frightened. He saluted Dink.

&quot;He&#39;s dead, sir?&quot; he asked,

Dink stared up at the man. His own scant five feet made him seem a dwarf beside the tall expanse of uniform and braid. Dink noted sourly that the doorman was a handsome young fellow.

&quot;Are you in love?&quot; he asked abruptly,

The man looked startled and confused, &quot;Why, yes, sir.&quot;

Dink pulled at one of his big ears. &quot;Ever been jilted?&quot;

The man grinned wryly, &quot;Yes, sir. Several times.&quot;

Dink nodded and shifted the cigar again. &quot;Did you ever want to end it all because some dame did you wrong?&quot;

The doorman stared hard at the detective. He slowly-shook his head, &quot;Not quite, sir. I&#39;ve felt like hell sometimes, but never that bad.&quot;

Dink took the cigar out of his mouth and examined the frayed end. He decided it was good for a few more minutes. He looked hard at the doorman, &quot;Take it easy, son. The love-bug&#39;s pretty deadly around here.&quot;

He pushed around the man and through the doors. The rich lobby was filled with an awed and frightened crowd. The manager was having a hard time explaining why such things happened at the Mardott. He saw Dink and came hustling over. His moon face was worried.

&quot;Can&#39;t your men finish up quickly out there, officer?&quot;

Dink&#39;s thick lips pursed. &quot;Maybe. We must have pictures.&quot;

The fat hands fluttered in horror.

&quot;I don&#39;t know why it should happen here! This is an apartment hotel with a fine and distinguished name. It will be hard on us.&quot;

Dink&#39;s green eyes glittered. &quot;It was pretty hard on Werner, But you wouldn&#39;t know, would you?&#39;&#39;

The manager showed a fleeting look of contriteness. &quot;Of course it is very sad, officer. But it is also a shock to my guests. After all, I must think of them.&quot;

Dink nodded. &quot;They&#39;re having the time of their lives, Jacobs. Nothing like a good suicide or murder to awaken a sluggish liver. I&#39;ll want to see you later.&quot;

He walked quickly to the elevator and the girl closed the ornate doors. The elevator started upward at a dignified pace. Dink leaned back against the wall and decided he liked what little of the girl&#39;s legs he could see below the conservative uniform. She had neat ankles and was pretty. Dink asked, &quot;Did you know Mr. Werner?&quot;

She nodded and kept her face turned, her eyes on the light panel. It wasn&#39;t very busy. &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Dink scratched his lean jaw. &quot;A nice guy?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes, sir!&quot; she said abruptly and Dink saw the red flush at the back of her neck. &quot;That is, he was quite a gentleman, sir, and very considerate.&quot;

\*\*\*

Dink saw that they were passing the sixth floor. He pulled himself away from the wall. &quot;I bet he was nice to you.&quot;

He caught a quick glance of brown eyes. He felt suddenly sorry for the girl. She was frightened. &quot;Don&#39;t mind me,&quot; he growled.

&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot; The doors slid open and Dink faced the hall that led to Werner&#39;s apartment. He could see the uniformed policeman before the door. He grinned into the girl&#39;s worried face and walked down the hall.

Prentice and Hall, from Dink&#39;s department, were looking things over. Prentice had the closet door open and was checking Werner&#39;s collection of suits. Hall had an open briefcase on a spindleleg table and was going through the papers.

He grinned up at Dink, &quot;This guy did all right. Lieutenant. He lived in style.&quot;

Dink nodded and walked to the open window. He looked down at the little figures far below. The ambulance was just rounding the corner. Dink turned back to the room and walked over to a desk against the far wall. Its top was open and a portable typewriter glistened in the light. There was a sheet of paper in the roller.

Dink bent down and read the typing. The letterhead was engraved, announcing that Jefferson Werner sold preferred lists of bonds and securities. The message below was brief.

&quot;I cannot live without you, Mary. Life has meant so much that it is blank and drear after you said all was over between us. I feel this is the only way out.&quot;

There was no signature, typed or written. Dink studied the note. The whole thing followed the usual pattern, still the note didn&#39;t ring quite true. He turned to Prentice, who had come out of the closet.

&quot;Any idea who Mary is?&quot; he asked. Prentice shook his head and pointed to a dresser near the bed. There&#39;s some frail&#39;s things over there that we found tucked around.&quot;

Dink pushed away from the desk, giving the note a second irritable look. He took off his hat and threw it on the bed. His baldness became immediately apparent and his ears looked bigger. His face was thin and bony, the nose large and predatory. His green eyes bulged slightly in the sockets and he always looked to be on the verge of an angry outburst. His lips were too wide for the face, and too thick. They always held an evil, frayed cigar.

He picked up a vanity case. It had a wing design with a lipstick container built into the top. Dink turned it over and read the manufacturer&#39;s name. It could have been purchased in a hundred places in the city. There was a brown bobby pin. There was a little square of white linen that had no laundry mark.

Dink held it to his hawk nose and sniffed. It faintly suggested face powder and nothing more. His green eyes glittered when he looked at the little .22-caliber revolver pushed back against a pair of military brushes. He turned to Prentice.

&quot;The lady didn&#39;t like him or didn&#39;t trust him. Maybe Werner was a heel.&quot;

The detective grinned. &quot;Sure. She fought for her honor and Werner got discouraged. He did a Brody.&quot;

Dink stood back and looked at the collection.

&quot;Maybe you got something.&quot; He pulled at one of his big ears. &quot;Prentice, there&#39;s a cute little dame on the elevator. Bring her in.&quot; The detective straightened. &quot;Her! You mean this guy played around with the help?&quot;

&quot;How the hell do I know?&quot; Dink growled and Prentice left the room. Dink stood by the open window again. He took out the frayed cigar, inspected its end. He sighed and threw the remains into a wastebasket. His bony fingers pulled out another and he thoughtfully chewed off the end.

He turned slowly, his eyes going over the room. Near the door, one edge of the rug was turned up and there was a big wrinkle in the fabric. A low table stood before two easy chairs. Powder made a peculiar pattern that caught Dink&#39;s attention.

He took his handkerchief and lifted the wing compact on the dresser. He crossed to the table and carefully lowered the metal box. The powder line on the table exactly framed the edge of the compact.

Hall looked up from the briefcase.

&quot;Got something, Lieutenant?&quot;

&quot;Where did you find the compact and gun?&quot; Dink asked.

Hall pointed to one of the chairs.

&quot;The compact was down behind the cushion. The gun was over there on the dresser.&quot;

\*\*\*

Dink nodded. &quot;The handkerchief?&quot;

&quot;Right where it was, on the dresser.&quot;

The door opened and a fat detective, Donegan, filled the frame. f We&#39;re through down below. Say, this guy Werner didn&#39;t register for elective Service. Anyway, we can&#39;t find his card.&quot;

Dink&#39;s thin brows raised. Prentice looked over Donegan&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;I got the girl here. Lieutenant.&quot;

Dink ordered the others out of the room. The girl was clearly frightened and nervous and Dink tried to make her comfortable in one of the chairs. She kept looking around the room and her hands wouldn&#39;t stay still in her lap.

Dink lit his cigar. It glowed a few seconds and then went out. He didn&#39;t notice. His bulging eyes watched the girl. She sat stiff in the chair. He saw that she had brown hair and that probably she used the same shade of bobby pin that he had found. He was satisfied to chew on the dead cigar and stare. The girl looked around the room, her eyes rested on the open window and skittered away. She twisted her fingers.

Finally she looked up, her forehead lined. &quot;I can&#39;t tell you anything.&quot;

Dink shrugged.

&quot;Maybe, maybe not. Did you bring anyone up to see Mr. Werner today?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; She explained hastily when his thin eyebrow arched. &quot;I&#39;ve brought several to this floor, but Mr. Werner&#39;s wasn&#39;t the only apartment.&quot;

&quot;Any women?&quot;

She hesitated noticeably. &quot;Yes, three. One of them was Mrs. Morton, down the hall, I didn&#39;t know the other two.&quot;

Dink shifted the cigar. &quot;Both of them young? Pretty?&quot;

She dropped her eyes to her fingers, &quot;One of them, yes. The other was about forty-five.&quot; She looked up and added quickly, &quot;I don&#39;t know where they went.&quot;

Dink smiled. He shouldn&#39;t have done it. He looked like an inebriated gargoyle.

&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;

&quot;Ruth Garson.&quot;

Dink seemed to go into a conference with the end of his cigar, considering it closely. He popped it back in his mouth.

&quot;Did you come in here today?&quot;

The girl&#39;s hands gripped the chair arms and there was strain in her face. She stared at him and Dink fixed her with his bulging green eyes. She licked her lips, then seemed to collapse back in the chair.

&quot;Yes,&quot; she said in a choked, low voice. &quot;I came just before I reported on duty.&quot; She jumped from the chair and her voice trembled in fear. &quot;But he was all right then! I didn&#39;t have anything to do with this.&quot;

Dick managed to get her back in the chair, &quot;You&#39;re not accused of anything. Miss Garson. What did you discuss?&quot;

She had control of herself.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fired for this. We are not supposed to become intimate with the guests.&quot;

Dink touched her arm reassuringly. &quot;I don&#39;t think this will get to the estimable Mr. Jacobs. Let&#39;s have it now.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Werner had taken me out several times. He was a nice and thoughtful man.        We — that is, I thought a lot of him. We were to go to the Sapphire Room tonight. That&#39;s what we were talking about.&quot;

Dink picked up the compact in his handkerchief and held it before her, &quot;Is this yours?&quot;

She stared at it and shook her head. Dink replaced the box and shifted his cigar. He patted her arm twice. &quot;That&#39;s all. Miss Garson. This won&#39;t get any further and you needn&#39;t worry about your job. Just give the officer in the hall your name and address. Don&#39;t move unless you inform the police, and don&#39;t try to leave town.&quot;

She arose uncertainly from her chair, dabbing at her eyes with a cheap handkerchief. Then she pushed back her slim shoulders, gave Dink a half smile, and walked from the room. Dink jerked his head at Donegan.

The big man came in, closing the door. Dink scowled at the compact.

&quot;Well, here we go again, Donegan. This is murder. No guy with a date with a girl like Miss Garson is going to jump out of a window.&quot;
