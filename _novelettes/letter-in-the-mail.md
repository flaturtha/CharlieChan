It was Saturday morning, and the hands on the dial of the great clock in the main banking room of the Third National stood at half past eleven.

Before the windows of each of the three paying tellers was a long line of impatient customers, cashiers of commercial firms, paymasters of factories, and the usual miscellany of the weekend. Some had checks in their hands which they fingered nervously; some shifted restlessly from foot to foot; all kept glancing impatiently down the line, half angry when a customer delayed a teller for a moment more than seemed necessary.

The line before the window of teller No. 1 was unusually troublesome. Teller No. I, as the brass sign in the window announced, was Mr. Haskell, a middle-aged man with thinnish light hair on the top of his head, which made his forehead seem very high. He had watery blue eyes, a fair complexion, and when he was nervous or excited the blood would mount from his throat to the high wall of his forehead, seeming to lose itself under the thin strands of his carefully parted hair.

Mr. Haskell was a bachelor, had been with the bank for many years, and was head paying teller. Because the other tellers worked under him, he occupied cage No. 1; and because cage No. I was nearest to the door, Mr. Haskell handled more customers than any of the other tellers.

On this Saturday morning the line before window No. I was so troublesome that even such an experienced teller as Mr. Haskell was to be excused for becoming peevish. The next man in line stepped up and pushed a check under the bars. &quot;Good morning! Five hundred in twenty-dollar gold pieces.&quot;

Mr. Haskell grunted and looked up. The man was paymaster of a large hat factory. &quot;Confound it! Everybody wants what I haven&#39;t got! Won&#39;t twenty-dollar bills do?&quot;

&quot;No. The directors voted tokens of appreciation to the old employees. My special instructions were to pay it in gold.&quot;

Mr. Haskell glanced at his stack of gold pieces. &quot;I haven&#39;t got it here. I&#39;ll have to go down to the vault.&quot; The line moved angrily.

&quot;Confound it all! Look at the string—and almost twelve!&quot; He picked up his bunch of keys, and turned around—paused—then threw the keys upon a desk in the corner of the cage, where a young man sat, listing checks on an adding machine. &quot;Go down to my vault, Moore, and bring up that sack of gold lying on the floor just inside the door.&quot;

He turned to the window again. &quot;Step aside, please; he&#39;ll be back in a moment.&quot; The next man in line moved up and laughed. Mr. Haskell looked at him, saw that his eyes were directed to the corner of the cage, and glanced around. The assistant teller sat at his desk, immovable, his hand poised over the keyboard of the machine, his eyes fixed on the bunch of keys. &quot;Looks like he&#39;s hypnotized,&quot; said the man.

&quot;Well, well, get busy, Moore!&quot; ordered Mr. Haskell sharply.

&quot;Yes, sir—yes, sir!&quot; And the young man sprang up, a frightened look on his white face. Mr. Haskell eyed him a moment, undecided, then turned reluctantly to the window again.

The young man pressed back the spring lock on the door in the rear of the cage, and passed out. He threaded his way through the maze of bookkeepers&#39; desks, the bunch of keys clasped in his hand, his eyes fixed straight before him. He knew now that he would do it—knew that he had always thought of doing it—knew that he had only been waiting a favorable moment. The plan which had been lurking in the hidden chambers of his mind sprang into sudden birth, and he was powerless before the strong temptation.

He passed down the steps to the basement, where the vaults were located. As he approached, the bunch of keys swinging from his hand, the watchman rolled back the iron gate, and admitted him to the vault room. Before him was an immense cavern, with the great door of many tons thrown wide open. He stepped inside—into the money vault—into the very heart of the bank.

The vault was divided into compartments, each a miniature vault in itself, guarded by a steel door which closed with lock and key. In some were kept the reserve funds of the bank—currency and securities. There was a compartment, also, for each of the tellers, and the first one on his right was Mr. Haskell&#39;s. He inserted the key into the lock and threw open the door.

When he had done this he was completely shielded from outside observation, as the door of the subvault extended more than halfway across the main entrance.

As he stood there, packages of money stacked high on the shelves—money in sacks—bills, gold, silver—the very air freighted with its odor—as he stood thus, a dizziness seized upon him. Impulse—that destroyer of multitudes of men—laid its hot hand upon his reason. He fought against it—hesitated—yielded.

With eager, trembling fingers, he unbuttoned his office coat, then his vest, then his shirt. He tightened the belt around his waist, reached up to the topmost shelf, and from the farthest corner took a bundle of bills. The top one was for fifty dollars, and upon the bands which held the package together was stamped two thousand dollars. He slipped the bundle inside his shirt, and reached up again, then again and again, until he had seven packages pressed close against his body.

Afraid that more might bulk too large and arouse suspicion, he quickly buttoned his shirt and vest and coat, ran his hands over himself to feel that the bundles lay flat and even, and stooped to pick up the sack of gold.

In that moment of stooping, a lightning flash of reason illumined the madness of his act. Outraged conscience sprang up in arms. He saw himself a malefactor, the hand of society against him, branded a felon by the law, lashed by the scourge of his own guilt. He straightened up, and began to tear open his coat; then he heard voices without the vault.

&quot;I say, Tom, did you see Moore down here?&quot;

&quot;Yes; he&#39;s inside the vault,&quot; replied the watchman.

Footsteps approached. Moore hastily buttoned his coat, and reached for the sack of gold. The head of an office boy appeared in the doorway, &quot;Say, Moore, old Haskell&#39;s about to have a fit upstairs. He sent me to look for you,&quot; said the boy, with a grin.

Moore did not answer. He closed the door, locked it, and, with the bag of money in his hand, he left the vault. Fate had intervened. One mad moment had changed the course of his life.

At the rattling of the cage door, Mr. Haskell stepped back and released the lock.

&quot;It took you a long time!&quot; he grumbled, taking the sack and keys from the young man&#39;s hand.

Moore muttered something about &quot;stopped to get a drink of water,&quot; and, taking his seat at the desk, resumed his operations on the adding machine.

Soon the hands on the great clock touched twelve, and the official banking day was over. The last few stragglers were served. Mr. Haskell hung out the tin sign bearing the word &quot;Closed&quot; before his window, and began to count his cash. Moore worked steadily away on the machine. The other tellers, their currency counted, turned out the lights in their cages, and carried their trays of money down to their compartments in the vault. One by one the clerks and bookkeepers, through with the day&#39;s work, left the building.

Presently Mr. Haskell stepped back and looked down the line of darkened cages. &quot;All gone, eh? Great Scott, this was a beastly day! I&#39;m glad tomorrow&#39;s Sunday. About through, Moore?&quot;

&quot;Just finished,&quot; answered the assistant, clearing the machine.

&quot;Good! Help me carry this stuff down to the vault. I&#39;ve got to hurry. Got an engagement for two o&#39;clock.&quot;

Moore picked up several sacks of money, and waited while Mr. Haskell turned out the light in the cage. They passed out into the deserted banking room.

&quot;All right, Mr. Wade,&quot; said Mr. Haskell, as they passed the cashier&#39;s desk.

The three of them—Moore first with the bags of money, then Haskell carrying the tray of bills, last the cashier— descended to the vault room.
