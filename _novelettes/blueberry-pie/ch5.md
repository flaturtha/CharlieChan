# Chapter 5
## A Way Out

Now, Dennison was gone. Lying in bed, now, Irene thought of him. How could she get even? Of course—she could kill him. But she&#39;d be found out—sent to the electric chair. She might get off, of course—most women did—but she mightn&#39;t be lucky. The chair! She shuddered. Someone had told her, once, that a few hours before a person was electrocuted, he was doped so that when the time came he was scarcely conscious of what was happening. That was the reason cowards appeared brave at their death, her informant had said. Maybe that was true. She didn&#39;t know. Even so, she didn&#39;t want to be electrocuted. She&#39;d be found out, of course, if she killed Dennison—or if she killed Miss Harrington. Anyhow, it wasn&#39;t Miss Harrington she wanted to get rid of, after all. Miss Harrington was just a part of a game, as she was part of a game. No, definitely, it was Dennison. She must get even. Kill him? She knew she couldn&#39;t actually kill him, though, at that.

How could she, a poor, friendless little thing, get even with anyone? She didn&#39;t have any influence of any sort. She had lived so entirely for Dennison, these two years, that she hadn&#39;t kept up with her acquaintances from the store, even. The only people she ever talked to were the neighbors. They couldn&#39;t do anything to help her. She felt helpless, trapped. She must do something.

She thought of killing herself. She couldn&#39;t quite do that, wasn&#39;t brave enough. Why should she die, anyhow? She was too young to die, not twenty-three, yet. No, she wanted to live—she wanted to live and get even—to kill Dennison.

Dennison was gone—never to come back. The rent for the apartment would have to be paid in a few days. She couldn&#39;t even keep on living there. She had a little money, though—What could she do?

She got up, went to the door, found the newspaper there, brought it in, sat on the edge of the bed reading it.

She glanced at the usual headlines: politics, world affairs. They didn&#39;t interest her. She turned to the inside pages, listlessly. What did anything matter to her?

Little scandals, divorces, deaths. She read them all, all seeing. What was this? She read a small item:

_Woman Takes Gas_

_Miss Grace Trummer, about twenty-five years old. A pretty little blonde seamstress, committed suicide at a rooming house in – Street, last night, by inhaling gas. Miss Trummer left no reason for the deed, and, as far as is known, she had no relatives—_

Irene dropped the paper on the bed. There, that was a way out—gas. She could do that—could end things that way. What if she did? That wouldn&#39;t hurt Dennison. He&#39;d be glad she was out of the way, really. If she could be found dead! If Dennison could be blamed! That would be something. He would be electrocuted for her murder! Of course! That would be clever!

In her mind, now, she went over the whole thing—how she could kill herself—and leave little evidences about, so that it would look as if Dennison had killed her. She&#39;d have to be careful, of course. Why, of course. She would have to make it look as if Dennison had planned to make it look like suicide or burglary! Burglary would be best. Dennison would die! She laughed almost wildly over that. She dressed and laughed all the while. She felt sort of funny. Was she mad? She didn&#39;t think she was. Of course not. Yes, that&#39;s the way she&#39;d do things.

But—then she would be dead. She didn&#39;t want to be dead. She wouldn&#39;t know about Dennison. She had to know. No, that wouldn&#39;t do either. She wanted to live. She was too young to die. She must get even with Dennison!

That woman who had died—a blonde woman, too, nearly her age. She wondered about her.

Then the thought came to Irene. It came to her, suddenly. It enveloped her, left her weak, dizzy. Could she get that body? If that body could be found—here—instead of hers!

The woman had no relatives—surely that would be easy enough. She would try. That was it. She could do her best. It was the only way—a way to get even….

Her heart started to sing in a wild way, a way it hadn&#39;t sung for a year—more than that. If she could—if she could fix things so that it would look as if Dennison….

She thought it over. If things went right! If not …well, she&#39;d have to take some chances, anyhow.

A ring at the doorbell. She trembled. The mailman. She went downstairs, a plan already formulated in her mind. She met Mrs. Peterson in the hall, started right in on the plan—talked with her … the vacation … a holiday with Dennison.

She telephoned to Schmidt to bring her trunk up. He brought it and the bags up almost immediately. She talked with him eagerly, nervously.

Another ring at the bell. It was the man for Dennison&#39;s trunk. She trembled as the man took it out. Mrs. Peterson, again. Dennison&#39;s trunk gone.

She finished dressing, went out, the clipping about the woman suicide in her purse.

Mrs. Peterson&#39;s door was still open. That prying little woman. She&#39;d keep on talking—prepare her—in case things went all right.
