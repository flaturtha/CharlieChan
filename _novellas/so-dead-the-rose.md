### Chapter 1
{: .chapternumber }

### Angelica Is Dead
{: .chaptertitle }

I let the door close with a sharp click, stood there like that with her in my arms, not moving. Then I pushed her away and went over to switch on the light.

"No! No! Don't, Red, don't!" she cried, "Please, please don't." So I didn't.

She was in my arms again, trembling like a frightened bird; without looking I knew she was crying, although I didn't know why. For a brief moment I didn't care … she was with me again. The scent of her next to me carried the fragrance of time past, and I almost forgot she was married to Mel English. Then I remembered and shoved her away at arm's-length.

"Red, Red," she sobbed, "what will I do? Tell me, what will I do?"

There was hysteria fomenting inside her and I acted before it rushed forth from her tight lips. I grabbed her and shook her. "What are you talking about? Do about what?"
She was sobbing wildly then, so I shook her some more. 

"Vera, Vera! What are you trying to say?"

I relaxed my grip and she leaned heavily against me. "Help me, Red, help me," she implored, and her fingernails dug deep marks into my forearms. "Angelica!" Vera moaned. "She … she's … dead!"
