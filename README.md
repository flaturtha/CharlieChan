Created new branch called 'dev'. The idea is to do the dev and daily work in this branch, then merge to the 'master' branch. For daily work (ss updates), it'll just be a quick update then merge (unless I figure out a better workflow).

From the 'dev' branch, I'll make another branch for my shopping cart redux dev ... essentially a 'feature-1' branch but with a better title!
