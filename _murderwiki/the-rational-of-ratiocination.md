In one of Doyle&#39;s stories, Sherlock Holmes himself states definitely his principles of deduction in what purports to be a magazine article written by himself. The opening paragraph, however, is in the words of the faithful Dr. Watson.

### Sherlock Holmes&#39; Method
{: .chaptertitle }

Its somewhat ambitious title was &quot;The Book of Life,11 and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and absurdity. The reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle, or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man&#39;s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that, until they learned the processes by which be had arrived at them, they might well consider him a necromancer.

>&quot;From a drop of water,&quot; said the writer, &quot;a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other. So all life is a great chain the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study, nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection of it. Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the inquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems. Let him, on meeting a fellow mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation and teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man&#39;s finger-nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser-knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt cuffs—by each of these things a man&#39;s calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent inquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.&quot;

It is the sentence last quoted that proclaims the Transcendent Detective, and it is this element of omniscience that gives him such popularity and homage as is received by any other worker in magic.

As an example of this sort of deduction let us examine definitely some of Sherlock Holmes&#39; work.

Typical in every respect, are his deductions from an old hat as here given:

>I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard, and much the worse for wear.

>The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discolored. There was no maker&#39;s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials &quot;H.B.&quot; were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discolored patches by smearing them with ink.

>&quot;I can see nothing,&quot; said I, handing it back to my friend.

>&quot;On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.&quot;

>&quot;Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?&quot;

>He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. &quot;It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,&quot; he remarked, &quot;and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.&quot;

>&quot;My dear Holmes!&quot;

>&quot;He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,&quot; he continued, disregarding my remonstrances. &quot;He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more potent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by-the-way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.&quot;

>&quot;You are certainly joking. Holmes.&quot;

>&quot;Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?&quot;

>&quot;I have no doubt that I am very stupid; but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?&quot;

>For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. &quot;It is a question of cubic capacity,&quot; said he; &quot;a man with so large a brain must have something in it.&quot;

>&quot;The decline of his fortunes, then?

>&quot;This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining.

>If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.&quot;

>&quot;Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?&quot;

>Sherlock Holmes laughed. &quot;Here is the foresight,&quot; said he, putting his finger upon the little disk and loop of the hat securer. &quot;They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see he had broken the elastic, and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavored to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.&quot;

>&quot;Your reasoning is certainly plausible.&quot;

>&quot;The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odor of lime-cream. The dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, gray dust of the street, but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time; while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could, therefore, hardly be in the best of training.&quot;

>&quot;But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.&quot; &quot;This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week&#39;s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife&#39;s affection.&quot;

>&quot;But he might be a bachelor.&quot;

>&quot;Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird&#39;s leg.&quot; &quot;You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?&quot;

>&quot;One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow; walks upstairs at night, probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?&quot;

And we will follow this with a similar example:

>&quot;I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.&quot;

>&quot;Seven!&quot; I answered.

>&quot;Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe.

>You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.&quot; &quot;Then, how do you know?&quot;

>&quot;I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?&quot;

>&quot;My dear Holmes,&quot; said I, &quot;this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess; but, as I have changed my clothes, I can&#39;t imagine how you deduce it.

>As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice; but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.&quot;

>He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.

>&quot;It is simplicity itself,&quot; said he; &quot;my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot- slitting specimen of the London slavery. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.&quot;

In his early acquaintance Watson doubted Holmes ability at this sort of deduction, and said to him, by way of test:

>&quot;I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it. Now, I have here a watch which has recently come into my possession. Would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner?&quot;

>&quot;Though unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren,&quot; Holmes observed, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack lustre eyes. &quot;Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother, who inherited it from your father.&quot;

>&quot;That you gather, no doubt, from the H.W. upon the back?&quot;

>&quot;Quite so. The W. suggests your own name. The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch: So it was made for the last generation. Jewellery usually descends to the eldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as his father. Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.&quot; &quot;Right, so far,&quot; said I. &quot;Anything else?&quot;

>&quot;He was a man of untidy habits—very untidy and careless. He was left with good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity, and finally taking to drink, he died. That is all I can gather.&quot;

>I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with considerable bitterness in my heart.

>&quot;This is unworthy of you. Holmes,&quot; I said. &quot;I could not have believed that you would have descended to this.

>You have made inquiries into the history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way. You cannot expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch! It is unkind, and to speak plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.&quot;

>&quot;My dear doctor,&quot; said he kindly, &quot;pray accept my apologies. Viewing the matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you. I assure you, however, that I never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.&quot;

>&quot;Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts? They are absolutely correct in every particular.&quot;

>&quot;What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend. For example, I began by stating that your brother was careless. When you observe the lower part of that watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places, but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket. Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty- guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man. Neither is it a very far-fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects.&quot;

>I nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning.

>&quot;It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take a watch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the inside of the case. It is more handy than a label, as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed. There are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case. Inference that your brother was often at low water. Secondary inference—that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could not have redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the inner plate, which contains the keyhole. Look at the thousand of scratches all round the hole—marks where the key has slipped. What sober man&#39;s key could have scored those grooves? But you will never see a drunkard&#39;s watch without them. He winds it at night, and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand. Where is the mystery in all this?&quot;

>&quot;It is as clear as daylight,&quot; I answered.

>I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. &quot;When I hear you give your reasons,&quot; I remarked, &quot;the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled, until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.&quot; &quot;Quite so,&quot; he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an arm-chair. &quot;You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.&quot;

>&quot;Frequently.&quot;

>&quot;How often?&quot;

>&quot;Well, some hundreds of times.&quot;

>&quot;Then how many are there?&quot;

>&quot;How many? I don&#39;t know.&quot;

>&quot;Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed.&quot;

### Lecoq&#39;s Method
{: .chaptertitle }

Lecoq announces his deductions with rather more dramatic circumlocution. With nothing to deduce from but footprints in the snow, he at last cries triumphantly:

>&quot;Now I know everything.&quot;

>&quot;Oh, dear, that is a big word to say.&quot;

>&quot;When I say everything, I mean everything that has reference to the drama played at the Widow Chupin&#39;s which has culminated in bloodshed. This deserted piece of land covered with snow is like a vast white page of a book, and the persons whom we are hunting have written upon it, not only their movements and their proceedings, but also the secret doubts, hopes, and fears which are agitating their souls. What do these fleeting footprints teach you, old man? Nothing; well, to me they are as full of life as the people who have left them behind; they breathe, they speak, and they denounce!&quot;

His conclusions being received somewhat dubiously he proceeds more definitely.

>&quot;Listen, then,&quot; continued Lecoq, &quot;to the writing as I read it. While the murderer was taking the two women to the Poivriere, his companion or his accomplice, as I think I may call him, waited for him here. He was a middle-aged man, rather tall, wore a soft hat and a brown woolly great-coat; he was probably married, as he wore a wedding-ring on the little finger of his right hand.&quot;

After the usual, &quot;this is too much!&quot; he continues his recital:

>&quot;We have come, old fellow, to the moment when the accomplice had mounted guard here, and the time seemed to him rather long. To make the time pass, he walked backward and forward the length of the beam, and every now and then stopped to listen, so as to break the monotony of his promenade. As he heard nothing he stamped his feet, doubtless saying to himself, &#39;What the deuce is the other fellow doing down there?1 He had walked up and down thirty times, for I have counted them, when a dull sound broke the silence—the two women were coming.&quot;

### Other Methods
{: .chaptertitle }

All of this is purely and simply the reasoning of Zadig and the early Orientals. On the whole this sort of &quot;spurious profundity&quot; is not difficult in detective fiction, however often it might fail to prove in real life.

>The Present Writer, moved to attempt it, wrote the following scene in a story, the characters being a Transcendant Detective and an Admiring Friend.

>I met him, accidentally one morning, when we both chanced to go into a basement of the Metropolis Hotel to have our shoes shined.

>While waiting our turn to get a chair, we stood talking, and, seeing a pair of shoes standing on a table, evidently there to be cleaned, I said banteringly:

>&quot;Now, I suppose. Stone, from looking at those shoes, you can deduce all there is to know about the owner of them.&quot;

>With a mild twinkle in his eye, but with a perfectly grave face, he said slowly:

>&quot;Those shoes belong to a young man, five feet eight inches high. He does not live in New York, but is here to visit his sweetheart. She lives in Brooklyn, is five feet nine inches tall, and is deaf in her left ear. They went to the theatre last night, and neither was in evening dress.&quot;

>I stared at him incredulously, as I always did when confronted by his astonishing &quot;deductions,&quot; and simply said: &quot;Tell this little Missourian all about it.&quot;

>&quot;It did sound well, reeled off like that, didn&#39;t it?&quot; he observed, chuckling more at my air of eager curiosity than at his own achievement. &quot;But it&#39;s absurdly easy, after all.

>He is a young man because his shoes are in the very latest, extreme, not exclusive style. He is five feet eight, because the size of his foot goes with that height of man, which, by the way, is the height of nine out of ten men, any way. He doesn&#39;t live in New York or he wouldn&#39;t be stopping at a hotel. Besides, he would be down-town at this hour, attending to business.&quot;

>&quot;Unless he has freak business hours, as you and I do,11 I put in.

>&quot;Yes, that might be. But I still hold that he doesn&#39;t live in New York, or he couldn&#39;t be staying at this Broadway hotel overnight, and sending his shoes down to be shined at half-past nine in the morning. His sweetheart is five feet nine, for that is the height of a tall girl. I know she is tall, for she wears a long skirt. Short girls wear short skirts, which make them look shorter still, and tall girls wear very long skirts, which make them look taller.&quot;

>&quot;Why do they do that?&quot; I inquired, greatly interested.

>&quot;I don&#39;t know. You&#39;ll have to ask that of some one wiser than I. But I know it&#39;s a fact. A girl wouldn&#39;t be considered really tall if less than five feet nine. So I know that&#39;s her height. She is his sweetheart, for no man would go from New York to Brooklyn and bring a lady over here to the theatre, and then take her home, and return to New York in the early hours of morning, if he were not in love with her. I know she lives in Brooklyn, for the paper says there was a heavy shower there last night, while I know no rain fell in New York. I know that they were out in that rain, for her long skirt became muddy, and in turn muddied the whole upper of his left shoe. The fact that only the left shoe is so soiled proves that he walked only at her right side, showing that she must be deaf in her left ear, or he would have walked part of the time on that side. I know that they went to the theatre in New York, because he is still sleeping at this hour, and has sent his boots down to be cleaned, instead of coming down with them on his feet to be shined here. If he had been merely calling on the girl in Brooklyn, he would have been home early, for they do not sit up late in that borough. I know they went to the theatre, instead of to the opera or a ball, for they did not go in a cab, otherwise her skirt would not have become muddied. This, too, shows that she wore a cloth skirt, and as his shoes are not patent leathers, it is clear that neither was in evening dress.&quot;

>I didn&#39;t try to get a verification of Fleming Stone&#39;s assertions; I didn&#39;t want any. Scores of times I had known him to make similar deductions, and in cases where we afterward learned the facts, he was invariably correct. So, though we didn&#39;t follow up this matter, I was sure he was right, and, even if he hadn&#39;t been, it would not have weighed heavily against his large proportion of proved successes.

As it turned out, being fiction, these astute deductions were correct in every particular, and led ultimately to the conviction of the criminal!

### Holmes&#39; Method Evaluated
{: .chaptertitle }

A side light on Sherlock Holmes&#39; character is shown by his attitude regarding the explanation of his own deduction. Doctor Watson thus expresses it:

>&quot;Like all Holmes&#39; reasoning the thing seemed simplicity itself when it was once explained. He read the thought upon my features, and his smile had a tinge of bitterness.

>&quot;I am afraid that I rather give myself away when I explain,&quot; said he. &quot;Results without causes are much more impressive.&quot;

Of course this is all part of the author&#39;s art, for it grasps the reader&#39;s sympathy and understanding, and forestalls his own slight feeling of disappointment at the exposed simplicity.

Not all of Sherlock Holmes&#39; deductions are quite as marvelous as Watson asserts. For instance, a strong point is made by Holmes, in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles,&quot; after reading a message concocted by means of pasting on paper words cut from a newspaper, and declaring at once that the words were cut from the London Times. Ability to distinguish the type of one great newspaper from another is not at all uncommon among newspaper readers. As a matter of fact, a large portion of the reading public could tell at once from what newspaper words were cut. It is the photographic memory rather than the analytic mind which performs this feat.

Again, not all of Holmes&#39; deductions are true in every detail. A pair of gold rimmed eye-glasses leads him to declare their owner &quot;a person of refinement and well-dressed,&quot; for, he says &quot;it is inconceivable that any one who wore such glasses could be slatternly in other respects.&quot; And yet, such conditions have often been known. But in the story, of course the lady proved to be refined and well-dressed, and thus the Transendent Detective&#39;s deductions were verified.

It is, of course, the spectacular deductions, the plays to the grand stand, that make for popularity. And no one could better combine the rational commonplace and the marvelous &#39;spurious profundity&#39; than Doctor Doyle has done in the character of Sherlock Holmes.

But much of this profound reasoning is far from spurious. In a moment of a serious dissertation on his own art, we learn this about it:

>Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together.

>&quot;The ideal reasoner,&quot; he remarked, &quot;would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it, but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents, should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilize all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment.

>It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavored in my case to do.&quot;

### The Inductive and the Deductive Methods
{: .chaptertitle }

It is not easy for the untutored reader or writer of detective stories always to differentiate between inductive and deductive reasoning. Perhaps some light may be thrown on this abstruse subject by reading carefully this extract from a book by Arlo Bates, entitled &quot;Talks on Writing English.&quot;

>&quot;It is proper and perhaps even important that the student shall learn the distinction which is made by logicians between reasoning which is inductive and that which is deductive. As a matter of practical work in the writing of arguments, the distinction is of less importance than might seem from the formality with which these terms are treated; but as Induction and Deduction are words which the true logician cannot mention without at least a seeming impulse to cross himself, it is well to know what the difference is.

>&quot;Induction, then, is reasoning from the particular to the general; the establishment of an hypothesis by showing that the facts agree with it. It is preeminently the scientific method. By observing natural phenomena, the scientist conceives what the law which governs them must be. This idea of the general principle is then the hypothesis which he attempts to prove; and his method is to examine the facts under all conditions possible, establishing his proposition by showing that the facts are in accord with it.

>&quot;Deduction is the converse of this, and consists in drawing out particular truths from general ones. A universal proposition may be regarded as a bundle in which are bound together many individual ones. It is the work of deduction to take these out,—to separate any one of them from the rest. The general truth, &#39;All metals are elements,1 includes in it the especial truths, &#39;Iron is an element,&#39; &#39;Gold is an Element,&#39; and so on for each metal which could be named. Deduction is the process of separating one of these from the whole. Speaking broadly, scientific reasoning is more likely to be inductive, while other reasoning is more likely to be deductive.&quot;

### Two Striking Examples
{: .chaptertitle }

A favorite exploit of the Transcendent Detective, is to follow silently another&#39;s train of thought; and then suddenly and seemingly with clairvoyance, announce what the other&#39;s thoughts are.

This is done first by Poe:

>We were strolling one night down a long dirty street, in the vicinity of the Palais Royal. Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least. All at once Dupin broke forth with these words.

>&quot;He is a very little fellow, that&#39;s true, and would do better for the Theatre des Varietes.&quot;

>&quot;There can be no doubt of that,&quot; I replied unwittingly, and not at first observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations. In an instant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was profound.

>&quot;Dupin,&quot; said I gravely, &quot;this is beyond my comprehension. I do not hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses. How was it possible that you should know I was thinking of—?&quot; Here I paused, to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I thought.—&quot;of Chantilly,&quot; said he, &quot;why do you pause?

>You were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy.&quot;

>This was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections. Chantilly was a quondam cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming stage-mad, had attempted the role of Xerxes, in Crebillon&#39;s tragedy so-called, and been notoriously pasquinaded for his pains.

>&quot;Tell me, for Heaven&#39;s sake,&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;the method—if method there is—by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter.&quot; In fact, I was even more startled than I would have been willing to express.

>&quot;It was the fruiterer,&quot; replied my friend, &quot;who brought you to the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for Xerxes et id genus omne.&quot;

>&quot;The fruiterer!—you astonish me—I know no fruiterer whomsoever.&quot;

>&quot;The man who ran up against you as we entered the street—it may have been fifteen minutes ago.&quot;

>I now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a large basket of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we passed from the

>Rue C        into the thoroughfare where we stood; but what had this to do with Chantilly I could not possibly understand.

>There was not a particle of charlatanerie about Dupin. &quot;I will explain,&quot; he said, &quot;and, that you may comprehend all clearly, we will first retrace the course of your meditations, from the moment in which I spoke to you until that of the rencontre with the fruiterer in question. The larger links of the chain run thus—Chantilly, Orion, Dr. Nichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer.11

>There are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives, amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained. The occupation is often full of interest; and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the starting-point and the goal. What, then, must have been my amazement when I heard the Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth. He continued:

>&quot;We had been talking of horses, if I remember right, just before leaving the Rue C—. This was the last subject that we discussed. As we crossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a large basket upon his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon a pile of paving-stones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair. You stepped upon one of the loose fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile, and then proceeded in silence. I was not particularly attentive to what you did; but observation has become with me, of late, a species of necessity.

>&quot;You kept your eyes upon the ground—glancing, with a petulant expression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement (so that I saw you were still thinking of the stones), until we reached the little alley called Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of experiment with the overlapping and riveted blocks. Here your countenance brightened up, and, perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the word &#39;stereotomy,1 a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement.

>I knew that you could not say to yourself &#39;stereotomy&#39; without being brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago I mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice the vague guesses of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do so. You did look up; and I was now assured that I had correctly followed your steps. But in that bitter tirade upon Chantilly, which appeared in yesterday&#39;s Musee, the satirists, making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler&#39;s change of name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line about which we have often conversed. I mean the line &#39;Perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum.&#39;

>&quot;I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written Urion; and, from certain pungencies connected with the explanation, I was aware that you could not have forgotten it. It was clear, therefore, that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of Orion and Chantilly. That you did combine them I saw by the character of the smile which passed over your lips. You thought of the poor Cobbler&#39;s immolation. So far, you had been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself up to your full height. I was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of Chantilly. At this point I interrupted your meditations to remark that as, in fact, he was a very little fellow—that Chantilly—he would do better at the Theatre des Varietes.&quot;

This feat is paralleled in the Sherlock Holmes story entitled &quot;The Resident Patient&quot;:

>&quot;Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation, I had tossed aside the barren paper, and leaning back in my chair, I fell into a brown study. Suddenly my companion&#39;s voice broke in upon my thoughts.

>&quot;You are right, Watson,&quot; said he. &quot;It does seem a very preposterous way of settling a dispute.&quot;

>&quot;Most preposterous!&quot; I exclaimed, and then, suddenly realizing how he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair and stared at him in blank amazement.

>&quot;What is this. Holmes?&quot; I cried. &quot;This is beyond anything which I could have imagined.&quot;

>He laughed heartily at my perplexity.

>&quot;You remember,&quot; said he, &quot;that some little time ago, when I read you the passage in one of Poe&#39;s sketches, in which a close reasoner follows the unspoken thoughts of his companion, you were inclined to treat the matter as a mere tour de force of the author. On my remarking that I was constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed incredulity.&quot;

>&quot;Oh, no!&quot;

>&quot;Perhaps not with your tongue, my dear Watson, but certainly with your eyebrows. So when I saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a train of thought, I was very happy to have the opportunity of reading it off, and eventually of breaking into it, as a proof that I had been in rapport with you.&quot;

>But I was still far from satisfied. &quot;In the example which you read to me,&quot; said I, &quot;the reasoner drew his conclusions from the actions of the man whom he observed. If I remember right, he stumbled over a heap of stones, looked up at the stars, and so on. But I have been seated quietly in my chair, and what clews can I have given you?&quot;

>&quot;You do yourself an injustice. The features are given to man as the means by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are faithful servants.&quot;

>&quot;Do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my features?&quot;

>&quot;Your features, and especially your eyes. Perhaps you cannot yourself recall how your reverie commenced?&quot; &quot;No, I cannot.&quot;

>&quot;Then I will tell you. After throwing down your paper, which was the action which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression. Then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly-framed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by the alteration in your face that a train of thought had been started. But it did not lead very far. Your eyes turned across to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which stands upon the top of your books. You then glanced up at the wall, and of course your meaning was obvious. You were thinking that if the portrait were framed it would just cover that bare space and correspond with Gordon&#39;s picture over there.&quot;

>&quot;You have followed me wonderfully!&quot; I exclaimed.

>&quot;So far I could hardly have gone astray. But now your thoughts went back to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were studying the character in his features. Then your eyes ceased to pucker, but you continued to look across, and your face was thoughtful. You were recalling the incidents of Beecher&#39;s career. I was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf of the North at the time of the Civil War, for I remember you expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was received by the more turbulent of our people. You felt so strongly about it that I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that also. When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the picture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil War, and when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled, and your hands clinched, I was positive that you were indeed thinking of the gallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle. But then, again, your face grew sadder; you shook your head. You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life. Your hand stole towards your own old wound, and a smile quivered on your lips, which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of settling international questions had forced itself upon your mind.

>At this point I agreed with you that it was preposterous, and was glad to find that all my deductions had been correct.&quot;

>&quot;Absolutely!&quot; said I. &quot;And now that you have explained it, I confess that I am as amazed as before.&quot;

>&quot;It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you. I should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day. But the evening has brought a breeze with it. What do you say to a ramble through London?&quot;
