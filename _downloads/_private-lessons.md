### The Situation
{: .chaptertitle}

From the window of the little brick bank Rufus Tench could see most of
Sparta; his glance included the dingy courthouse in the delta of the
road on one side, and the frame station between the two warehouses for
cotton and tobacco on the other—a somnolent, threadbare little county
seat, already beginning to drowse through the blazing day, although the
sun barely had lifted above the roof the Mackrimmon House, and a broad
belt of shadow lay along the farther side of the highway.

Mr. Tench frowned as he inspected the familiar setting; Sparta
perpetually offended his sense of fitness, and the offense deepened as
his attitude became more and more proprietary. He resented the deep dust
of the road, the paintless buildings, the languor of the few inhabitants
who were visible, the air of apathetic shiftlessness which lay over the
village as perceptibly as the film of summer dust which grayed the sod
and shrubs about the courthouse.

Properly managed, Sparta might have been busy, prosperous, alive, like
the faraway towns Mr. Tench remembered. There was plenty of money to be
made here; the surrounding country had proved fertile, and no rival
settlement was within a radius of fifteen miles. Rufus Tench had chosen
it with an eye to these conditions; he had made a good thing of his
little private bank, very largely because his brisk energy set him apart
among the drawling, shambling natives. In one of those bustling
communities he thought of, it would have been harder to start a bank,
harder to make it pay, harder to retain a monopoly of the business.
Rufus Tench was perfectly aware of this, but, because he had come to
feel that Sparta belonged to him, he was ashamed of the characteristics
which had mainly contributed to that result.

He scowled as he watched two slouching darkies shuffle across the road
from the jail in the basement of the courthouse, carrying a huge basket
between them. If Mr. Tench had held the contract for feeding the
prisoners there would be money in that empty basket; he was irritated by
the reminder that Sheriff Dan Mackrimmon pampered the jail inmates on
regular hotel fare, instead of giving them their bare legal allowance.

His eye followed the pair to the corner of the rambling wooden building
which housed the hotel, and rested speculatively on the two-story porch
which masked its streetward face. It could be a little gold mine, that
hotel, if a businessman owned it. When the court was in session every
bed was in demand; even during the dullest months there were a few daily
visitors, marooned in town between the morning train from the main line
and the afternoon “mixed” back. And the jail contract alone would pay
expenses.

He would not have regarded the double galleries so bitterly if Sheriff
Mackrimmon had been enjoying the revenue which Mr. Tench had estimated a
hundred times. It was the knowledge that Mackrimmon barely made ends
meet, which exasperated him. The sheriff just about supported himself on
the proceeds of his several activities: the meager fees of his office,
the slender margin of profit on the jail contract and the hotel itself,
the occasional windfall from the livery he operated in connection with
it. Mr. Tench would have made every one of those sources more
productive, and the daily contemplation of a potential gain going
placidly to waste had come to seem almost an affront.

Mackrimmon wouldn’t sell, even at a figure well above the presumptive
value of his property. He would not consider incorporating himself and
permitting Mr. Tench to secure an interest. He was contemptibly content
to drift along, earning a bare living from a business which ought to
have made him rich.

The shoofly train groaned to a halt at the station. Mr. Tench watched a
little group descend from the single coach, his eye sifting out the
aliens from the homing native traveler. He scowled more acidly than ever
as he saw the five salesmen march along the strip of shade to the hotel,
instead of scattering at once to their work. It was after eight, and
these men had been riding nearly an hour, but they had waited for
breakfast, nevertheless. Mr. Tench knew why: at the Mickrimmon House
they could buy a dollar meal for fifty cents. Mackrimmon couldn’t seem
to realize that prices had gone up!

He stood in the window, thinking wistfully of what he could do with such
an opportunity, hugging his contempt for the sheriff and the community
which tolerated him. His lips tightened and drew down as he saw
Mackrimmon leave the courthouse and come toward him, a great, swollen
figure in faded blue serge, a rusty, wide-brimmed black hat casting a
shadow like a mask across the upper part of his red, plump face. The
man’s very walk was shiftless, he thought. But the frown faded when he
realized that the sheriff was headed for the bank, and guessed his
errand. There was a solace in the thought of the coming interview.

Mackrimmon nodded gravely and said good morning in a slow, thin drawl.
The banker answered briskly.

“Well, sheriff, what can we do for you? Decided to sell me that hotel,
after all?”
