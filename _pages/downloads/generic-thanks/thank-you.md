    <p class="first">Are you tired of the mind-numbing annoyance of endless status updates, fake & inflammatory news tidbits, political rants (<em>did you see the latest thing that you-know-who said?</em>), and endless ads on your social media streams?</p>

    <p>I’m sorry to tell you that the Facebook hack you just saw that promised to clean up your feed isn’t gonna help!</p>

    <p>The amount of ads, political garbage, and boring updates from your social media “friends” (<em>Who is that guy, anyway? Why ARE we friends on Facebook?</em>) aren’t going away anytime soon.</p>

    <p>But it’s not <em>your</em> fault!</p>

    <p>You didn’t sign up for all that! You joined Instagram to see cool pics from friends (the real ones). You connected on Facebook for the social aspects, connecting with far-flung friends and colleagues.</p>

    <p>I get it. That <em>ping</em> notification of yet another update annoys me as much as hearing my phone ring … I mean, who’s bugging me now? But I feel the draw of it &hellip; <span class="bold">TIME SUCK!</span></p>

    <p>If you’re like me and are tired of wasting your precious few moments on the endless babble of the masses, I’ve got a far better solution for an ARMCHAIR DETECTIVE like you &hellip;</p>

    <p class="italics narrow small" style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">Read a complete story (they range from 30 – 90 mins in length), or read just a chapter when you have a few minutes to kill (most chapters are short enough to read in 5 – 10 mins).

    <p class="testimonial">MR. BINGLER'S MURDER MAZE &mdash;<br><em><span>&ldquo;</span>Loved it! Especially the ending. Had a couple of twists I didn't see coming. Enjoyed it very much!<span>&rdquo;</span></em><br>&mdash;&nbsp;R. Taylor</p>

    <p>If you’ve read this far, I know you’re at least intrigued. But you may be asking if these stories are really worth it … even at this great price.</p>

    <div class="magazinelogos">
      <img src="/assets/img/misc/bm.png" alt="THE BLACK MASK magazine">
      <img src="/assets/img/misc/crack.png" alt="CRACK DETECTIVE magazine">
      <img src="/assets/img/misc/fbids.png" alt="F.B.I. DETECTIVE STORY magazine">
    </div>

    <p>I already mentioned a few names, authors of these novelettes. Maybe they’re familiar, maybe not. But each story in this LIBRARY was originally published in magazines like <em>The Black Mask, Complete Detective Tales, FBI Detective Stories, All Star Detective</em>, and more. They were published during the heyday of the pulp detective and mystery fiction, as early as 1895 and up through the 1950s.</p>

    <p>This isn’t any of that self-published, never edited or peer-reviewed junk that’s slung out by so many wannabe writers. This is tested and proven. Each one was vetted, reviewed, edited, and reworked by professional editors whose paycheck depended on finding well-written, exciting, suspenseful stories like the novelettes in the collection.</p>

    <ul class="benefits">
      <li class="bold">Always have a great mystery story at your fingertips.</li>
      <li class="bold">Easy to read on any device, like the one in your pocket all day!</li>
      <li class="bold">The perfect escape when you’ve got a few minutes to kill.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Each novelette is available as a <em>.mobi</em> (for Kindle apps & devices) and standard <em>ePub</em> (for Apple Books, Nook, etc.) for quick, easy download to any phone, tablet, or desktop (I won’t tell your boss!).</p>

    <img src="/assets/img/misc/covers.png" class="library-cover" alt="THE MURDER MYSTERY LOVER’S COMPLETE NOVELETTE LIBRARY">

    <p>When you buy this collection of stories (not available anywhere else), you’ll receive the full LIBRARY Sample Pack ebook in the format of your choice (.mobi or ePub). It includes the cover images, tables of contents, and a short sample, PLUS download links for each story.</p>

    <p>Simply browse, select, download, & enjoy.</p>

    <p>Then, once a week, you’ll get a notification with links to download the novelette of the week, for life!</p>

    <p class="narrow italics" style="width:600px;max-width:90%;margin-left:3rem;">(This lifetime offer is only available for a short time. If you buy the LIBRARY today, you’ll never pay for another novelette again; unlike those who buy the LIBRARY after this offer goes away … they’ll pay a monthly fee of up to $15.99 to get access to the full LIBRARY and the new, weekly releases.)</p>

    <p class="bold uppercase bloodred" style="margin-top: 2rem;">You get:</p>
    <ul class="youget">
      <li><span class="bloodred uppercase">a downloadable ebook</span> &hellip; with links to download each novelette individually</li>
      <li><span class="bloodred uppercase">thirty-three (33) novelettes available immediately</span> &hellip; something for every mood</li>
      <li><span class="bloodred uppercase">a new novelette every week</span> &hellip; lifetime access, no extra charge</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Plus, as an early adopter, you’ll get a special coupon code that will get you an additional 50% off all future purchases (by separate email; coming in a couple days).</p>

    <p>That’s right … not only am I giving you access to every novelette in my collection (plus future ones as they’re published), you can also get any novella or novel (or future products like audiobooks, illustrated novels, etc.) for 50%.</p>

    <p>(* Current prices on novellas & novels will be increasing soon … by as much as 2 – 3X, so if you buy now with your coupon, you can save significant money while building your always-at-your-fingertips murder mystery library!)</p>

    <hr class="break">

    <h3 class="bold bloodred center">Get all of this for just $15.99 today!</h3>
    <p class="subtext center">(I can only offer this price for a short time … if you pass now and decide later to buy, it’ll cost at least $29.99).</p>

    <p>Normally, each novelette costs <span class="bold">$4.99</span>, so you’d pay <span class="fullprice">$159.68</span> to get the remaining <span class="flip">32</span> novelettes (plus the free one you just got as a new subscriber). And that’s just for the current collection of 33 novelettes!</p>

    <p>Plus, when the lifetime access opportunity disappears in a few weeks, replaced with a monthly subscription, you’ll pay as much as <span class="fullprice">$15.99 a month</span> to access these exciting stories.</p>

    <p><strong>Try it risk free &mdash;</strong> Look, you came to my site today and downloaded a free novelette. You weren’t prepared to spend cash money. Maybe today was the 1st time you’ve visited; or maybe you’ve read a few short stories, etc. But you still don’t know if it’s worth it.</p>

    <p>EVERYTHING on <span class="companyname">TalesofMurder.com</span> is guaranteed by my <span class="companyname">LUV-IT GUARANTEE</span> &hellip; either you luv it, or I’ll refund 100% of your purchase price. (And it’s a digital download, so it’s not like I can send a couple of heavies to your house and demand you delete them &hellip;)</p>

    <p>So take advantage of this <em>limited time</em> offer; get your copy of the <span class="companyname">THE MURDER MYSTERY LOVER’S COMPLETE NOVELETTE LIBRARY</span> today. Then, if its not something you really want, I'll refund your payment price of $15.99. No questions asked.</p>

    <hr class="break">

    <p><span class="bold">My goal</span>, the reason I’m offering this incredible deal, is that I love these stories. I firmly believe that they are worth preserving and sharing with a new generation of mystery fans, like you. And I want you to enjoy them as much as I do.</p>
