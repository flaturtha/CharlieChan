				<p>You have entered a world of fictional crime and murder, where greed, avarice and selfish desire lurk in the minds of normal folks and spur them to commit heinous crimes.</p>
				<img src="/assets/img/misc/detective.svg" alt="" class="sh__topimg2">
				<p>It is also a world of detectives – private eyes and maverick cops – who see what mere mortals overlook, uncover hidden clues and shift through evidence to bring the guilty to justice.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Innocent victims caught up in a nightmare of false accusations and dangerous events beyond their control.</li>
					<img src="/assets/img/misc/oldlady.svg" class="sh__topimg3" alt="" style="margin: 0 1rem 0 -4rem;">
					<li>Little old ladies snooping through cupboards, peering through hedgerows and into the lives of genteel society to uncover dark secrets.</li>
					<img src="/assets/img/misc/poisonbottle.svg" class="sh__topimg4" alt="" style="margin-right: 1rem;">
					<li>Daring crooks vying for one great score and the determined detectives in hot pursuit.</li>
					<li> Crazed criminals, daring detectives, damsels in distress, pernicious plots, malicious murder, and tantilizing tales!</li>

				<a href="/short-stories/"><img src="/assets/img/starthere/ss-label2.png" alt="Short Stories" class="label"></a>
				<p>The <span class="bloodred">SHORT STORY</span> is a story of less than 1 hours read, or as Edgar Allen Poe, the father of the modern short story said, a short story deals with a single character, a single event, a single emotion, or the series of emotions called forth by a single situation. It is the single effect, complete and self-contained and thus has the effect of “totality” or as Poe called it, “the unity of impression.”</p>
				<p>Running from short 5-minute reads up to about an hour, these stories are free to read online and stories longer than a 30-45 minute read are available to download as ePub or Kindle files for reading offline at your leisure.</p>

				<a href="/novellas/"><img src="/assets/img/starthere/novellas-label2.png" alt="Novellas" class="label"></a>
				<p>Too long or complex to be a short story, but too short to be called a novel, the <span class="bloodred">NOVELLA</span> is a story that takes the average reader 2&ndash;3 hours to complete. It may contain, like the short story the unity of expression or may expand to greater length and multiple episodes, not unlike the longer novel.</p>
				<p>These downloadable tales run between just over an hour to an average reading time of 3&ndash;4 hours, depending on your reading speed.</p>
				<p>Perfect for a rainy evening or a sunny afternoon!</p>

				<a href="/novels/"><img src="/assets/img/starthere/novels-label2.png" alt="Novels" class="label"></a>
				<p>A long form of narrative that, by definition, the <span class="bloodred">NOVEL</span> cannot be read at one sitting (although with the right story, like <a href="/novels/spider-lily/" class="underline">The Spider Lily</a>, it can be done!).</p>
				<p>It carries the story from beyond the brief single encounter of Poe’s short story and enables both the author and the reader to explore the subject in greater depth. It often entails numerous subplots and threads that inform the primary plot.</p>
				<p>The typical novel will require multiple sessions over the course of 5 or more hours combined. Perfect for that summer beach read!</p>
