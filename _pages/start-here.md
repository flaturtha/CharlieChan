				<p>You have entered a world of fictional crime and murder, where greed, avarice and selfish desire lurk in the minds of normal folks and spur them to commit heinous crimes.</p>
				<p>It is also a world of detectives – private eyes and maverick cops – who see what mere mortals overlook, uncover hidden clues and shift through evidence to bring the guilty to justice.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Innocent victims caught up in a nightmare of false accusations and dangerous events beyond their control.</li>
					<li>Little old ladies snooping through cupboards, peering through hedgerows and into the lives of genteel society to uncover dark secrets.</li>
					<li>Daring crooks vying for one great score and the determined detectives in hot pursuit.</li>
					<li> Crazed criminals, daring detectives, damsels in distress, pernicious plots, malicious murder, and tantilizing tales!</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Are you prepared to delve deep into the dark underworld of literary crime &amp; murder?</h3>
