  <p>Your <span class="bold bloodred">ARMCHAIR DETECTIVES BUREAU</span> test is on its way. Check your email in a few minutes, then just read the story and consider the clues before submitting your answer!</p>

  <p>Look for an email with the subject line:</p>

  <p>New short stories are posted on the site every other day on a rotating 2-week schedule so you'll get an email from me whenever that story posts.</p>
